Abstract We present preliminary results of a long-term study aimed
at answering a number of open questions on the evolution of starbursts in
local galaxies The project employes mainly HST data from the ultravi-
olet to the red of the stellar continuum and of the nebular emission from
the galaxies Here we concentrate on NGC5253 and NGC5236 M83
that form a dwarfmassive galaxy pair at about 4 Mpc distance The
recent star formation history of the centers of the two galaxies is investi-
gated in order to identify similarities and dierences in the evolution of
their central starbursts
Introduction
Star formation is a driving force behind galaxy evolution it largely determines
the stellar energy radiant and mechanical metal and dust content of a galaxy
Throughout much of the history of the Universe a signicant fraction of the
galaxy population is represented by galaxies undergoing intense star formation
activity at redshift z1 the star formation rate per unit comoving volume was
roughly an order of magnitude higher than at present times Lilly et al 1996
Madau et al 1996 Cowie Songaila  Barger 1999 Yet a number of questions
related to the evolution of intense star formation episodes remain unresolved
Among them 1 the duration duty cycle and star formation history of star-
bursts 2 the importance of self-triggering and propagation for the evolution
of the starburst eg Walborn et al 1999 3 the impact of starbursts on the
host galaxys ISM and the feedback onto the evolution of the starburst itself
and 4 the possibility of distinct cluster and diuse eld star formation modes
Meurer et al 1995
In order to begin addressing these issues we are undertaking a comprehen-
sive study of 20 nearby 20 Mpc starburst galaxies covering a representa-
tive range of characteristics morphological types ranging from dwarf irregulars
He 2-10 to grand-design spirals M83 starburst star formation rates SFR
from 01 M yr1 to 5 M yr1 metallicities from 113 Z to 2 Z and dust
attenuations in the range 0AV 3 The data that are being collected for
this study include HST ultraviolet and optical imaging in broad and narrow
band lters of the stellar continuum and selected nebular emission lines typi-

cally H and H for dust reddening corrections and for tracing the ionized gas
OIII5007 A and SII6731 A for mapping of photo and shockionized gas
groundbased optical imaging and HST UV spectroscopy In this contribution
we concentrate on the galaxy pair NGC5253NGC5236 for which almost all
needed data are available and the analysis is almost completed
The two galaxies form an interesting complementary pair in the Centaurus
Group NGC5253 is a dwarf galaxy that is about 10 times more metal poor
15 Z and about 100 times less massive 109 M than its grand-design
spiral companion NGC5236 M83 The projected distance between the two
galaxies is 130 kpc and a close encounter between the two about 12 Gyr
ago has been suggested as the initial trigger of the star formation in NGC5253
Rogstad Lockhart  Wright 1974 van den Bergh 1980 Caldwell  Phillips
1989 Despite the dissimilarities of the host galaxies the central starbursts
share some common properties both have a SFR02 M yr1 over an area of
400 pc in size and both are characterized by patchy dust obscuration with
relatively transparent regions counterbalanced by highly opaque areas and dust
lanes However while in NGC5253 star formation is diused throughout the
central region Calzetti et al 1997 and references therein in NGC5236 star
formation is concentrated in a semiannulus centered on the optical nucleus
and has possibly been triggered by the galaxys bar Thatte et al 2000 Harris
et al 2001
Located at a distance of about 4 Mpc Sandage et al 1994 the two galaxies
were imaged with the HST WFPC2 from the UV to the I-band Calzetti et al
1997 Harris et al 2001 yielding a resolution of 12 pc per pixel which is
comparable to the typical half-light radius of stellar clusters The UVVI colors
of the central galaxies regions combined with the H emission map were used
to constrain the ages of the stellar populations while HH ratio maps were
used to remove the eects of dust reddening from the colors and luminosities
HST STIS long-slit UV spectra of the central region of NGC5253 were used to
analyze in detail the characteristics of the hot star populations in this galaxy
Tremonti et al 2001 Below is a summary of our current understanding of the
star formation history in the centers of the two galaxies
2 The Dwarf Galaxy NGC5253
The central region of active star formation in this galaxy is very blue at UV
optical wavelengths except for a prominent dust lane with AV 22 mag that
bisects the starburst nearly perpendicularly to the galaxys major axis Calzetti
et al 1997 and Figure 1 The region contains about a dozen UV-bright stellar
clusters as well as diusely distributed blue stars Meurer et al 1995 Radio
observations however indicate that the bulk of the most recent star formation
is hidden by dust Turner Ho  Beck 1998 Turner Beck  Ho 2000 The
distribution of the UV emission is slightly elongated along the major axis and
is markedly dierent from the morphology of the ionized gas emission H the
latter is circularly symmetric about a bright stellar cluster close to the geometric
center of the galaxy NGC52535 of Calzetti et al 1997 see Figure 1 and is
about a factor of 2 more extended than the UV stellar continuum Calzetti et
al 1999
Star Formation in the Local Universe
Figure 1 left The UV 2600 A WFPC2 image of the central starburst in
NGC5253 showing the presence of a number of bright stellar clusters and of
diuse emission The image has size 38 which correspond to a physical size
of 700 pc The position of the STIS slit is shown as a thick line Tremonti et
al 2001 The number 5 shows the position of the super-star-cluster candidate
NGC5253-5 which has age 2 Myr and is at the center of the peak-activity
region Calzetti et al 1997 North is up East is left
Figure 2 right Colorcolor UVV versus VI diagram of the central
400 pc of NGC5253 each data point corresponds to a square bin about 10 pc in
size The colors shown have been subtracted for the underlying galaxy popula-
tion and corrected for dust reddening The curve represents the locus of models
of constant star formation from Leitherer  Heckman 1995 and from Bruzual
 Charlot 1995 representative model ages are marked
Extinctioncorrected colorcolor and colorEWH plots show that star
formation has been an on-going process for the past 200 Myr in the central
400 pc of NGC5253 Figure 2 At present the peak of activity identied with
the H peak emission is located in an area 5060 pc in size right north of the
dust lane centered on NGC5253-5 Figure 1 The area appears as young as
5 Myr as suggested by the large EWH Calzetti et al 1997 the presence
of W-R stars Schaerer et al 1997 the scarcity of red supergiants Campbell 
Terlevich 1984 and the purely thermal component of the radio emission Beck
et al 1996 observations at radio wavelengths have revealed the presence of a
dusty supernebula in the area possibly the youngest globular cluster known
Turner Beck  Ho 2000 Although this is the most active region in the
starburst with a SFR20 M yr1 it is not the UV-brightest the area of peak
activity is indeed rather dusty likely still embedded in the parental molecular
cloud with AV 935 mag The bulk of the observed UV emission is emerging
Calzetti  Harris
from the less active relatively unextincted surrounding region extending out to
200 pc in radius This is the region where star formation has been going on at
a relatively constant pace for 100200 Myr at the modest rate of 02 M yr1
Apart for some evidence that star formation may be concentrating toward the
center thus moving inward there is no other sign of a spatial evolution of the
starburst in this galaxy

slit along the spatial direction The gure shows the separate components that
make up the UV emission of the starburst stellar clusters marked by num-
bers and diuse light marked as Field that are well above the background
marked as Sky
Figure 4 right The average cluster UV spectrum is compared with the
average eld UV spectrum The two are markedly dierent in particular the
spectrum of the eld lacks broadline proles in NV1240 A SiIV1400 A
and CIV1550 A This dierence excludes scattered cluster light as source of
the diuse UV light see the text and Tremonti et al 2001 for a discussion of
the nature of the diuse light
The long-slit of STIS was used to target a number of stellar clusters and the
intracluster UV light in the center of NGC5253 and spectra in the wavelength
range 11501700 A were obtained Figure 1 and Tremonti et al 2001 Eight
clusters fall within the STIS slit Figure 3 while the diuse light marked as
Fields in Figure 3 covers a region of 22019 pc2 in total The eight clusters
have ages between 1 Myr and 8 Myr and masses between a few 100 M and
4104 M The mass of cluster NGC5253-5 is highly uncertain depending on
uncertain dust corrections and could be as high as 6105 M possibly the
cluster coincides with the supernebula detected in the radio by Turner et al
2000
The UV spectrum of the eld is markedly dierent from the average spec-
trum of the stellar clusters in that it lacks the broadline proles of NV SiIV
Star Formation in the Local Universe
and CIV characteristic of O-star winds Figure 4 The diuse UV light makes
up between 50 and 80 of the total UV emission from local starburst galaxies
Buat et al 1994 Meurer et al 1995 Maoz et al 1996 it has been suggested
to originate from a mode of star formation that is separate from that of stel-
lar clusters Meurer et al 1995 Comparison of the STIS UV spectra of the
eld with models indicate that if the eld population is produced by a separate
mode of star formation from that of the clusters this implies also a dierent
IMF between the two In particular while the stellar clusters are compatible
with a Salpeter 235 IMF in the range 1100 M the eld population needs
either a steeper-than-Salpeter IMF slope  35 or a standard IMF slope with
an upper mass cut-o at 30 M Tremonti et al 2001 Steep IMF slopes have
been found also for the eld stars of the SMC and LMC although the values
are more extreme  5 than those derived for NGC5253 Massey et al 1995
An alternative scenario to bimodal star formation is that of dissolving clusters
The eld UV spectrum Figure 4 is well modelled by a constant star formation
synthetic spectrum from which the young stars younger than 10 Myr contribu-
tion has been subtracted This aged constant model can easily account for the
absence of the broad lines in NV SiIV and CIV because the Ostars have been
removed from it According to this model the lack of massive stars in the eld
is due to the lack of young stars The clusters for which ages have been derived
either from spectroscopy or photometry are typically younger than 1020 Myr
If these are representative of the clusters population in the starburst clusters
are generally younger than the elds stars Thus it is possible that all stars
form in clusters the clusters dissolve over a timescale of 10 Myr and their
surviving stars disperse into the eld Models on the dissolution of compact
stellar clusters in the center of galaxies Kim Morris  Lee 1999 predict that a
5103 M in NGC5253 evaporates in 1520 Myr This dissolution timescale
is in the required ballpark to make the scenario consistent with the measured
ages of NGC5253s clusters
3 The Massive Galaxy NGC5236 M83
The starburst in M83 is harbored in a morphologically and dynamically com-
plex central region Figure 5 Located within the main bar of the galaxy the
center of M83 appears to contain a well-dened nuclear subsystem The bright
optical nucleus is oset from the center of the outer isophotes opposite to the
starburst semi-annulus Gallais et al 1991 and a nuclear bar may separate
the bright nucleus from the center Elmegreen Chromey  Warren 1998 The
possible double nucleus suggests that another galaxy merged with M83 in the
past the merging event together with the galaxys bar is a potential trigger of
the current central starburst Dense molecular gas is concentrated to the north
of the starburst semi-annulus Israel  Baas 2001 perhaps a result of material
collecting around an inner Lindblad resonance as suggested by Gallais et al
1991 This cold material may be feeding the central starburst Petitpas 
Wilson 1998
The starburst itself in addition to be of comparable intensity to the event
in NGC5253 is bright at all wavelengths from the X-ray Ehle et al 1998
through the UV Kinney et al 1993 optical and nearIR Gallais et al 1991

Figure 5left The UV 2900 A WFPC2 image of the central region in
NGC5236 showing the semi-annulus of active star formation and the position
of the optical nucleus marked with a cross The nucleus is very bright at red
wavelengths but faint in the UV A dark dust lane is located at the right edge
of the image The image has size 19 which corresponds to a physical size of
360 pc North is up East is left
Figure 6right Colorcolor UVV versus VI diagram of the central
300 pc of M83 each data point corresponds to a square bin about 5 pc in
size The light from the 45 bright clusters and from the underlying galaxy has
been subtracted from the images prior to calculating these colors that are also
corrected for dust reddening The curve represents the locus of models of con-
stant star formation from Leitherer et al 1999 at the appropriate metallicity
for the galaxy representative model ages are marked
Rouan et al 1996 through the midIR Telesco et al 1993 to the radio
Turner  Ho 1994 Multiple dust lanes cross the center of this metalrich
galaxy although dust is very patchy as demonstrated by the UVbrightness of
the starburst semi-annulus Figure 5 Two bright midIR sources possibly two
very young knots of star formation are located at the NW edge of the starburst
annulus close to andor embedded in a major dust lane Telesco et al 1993
The UVbright region of star formation breaks down into almost 400 clusters
brighter than mU V 18 mag Harris et al 2001 while diuse light represents
more than 20 of the total UV emission The H morphology closely follows
that of the stellar emission a dierent characteristic from NGC5253
An analysis of the colors and EWH of the UVbright population in M83
analogous to that performed for NGC5253 see previous section reveals that
star formation has been continuous for the past 011 Gyr Figure 6 This
Star Formation in the Local Universe
is not dissimilar to what found in NGC5253 although a larger fraction of the
population in M83 contains stars older than 500 Myr Harris et al 2001
Figure 7 left Colorcolor UVV versus VI diagram of the 45 brightest
clusters in M83 The observed colors are shown as empty circles the dust-
reddening corrected ones as lled circles Lines connect the data points before
and after reddening corrections Filled circles with no connecting line are clus-
ters located in areas of low or no reddening Large empty circles with a central
dot indicate clusters whose age could not be determined from colors in these
cases the EWH was used The curve represents the locus of instantaneous
burst models from Leitherer et al 1999 at the appropriate metallicity for the
galaxy representative model ages are marked
Figure 8 right A map of the cluster positions in M83 each cluster is marked
by its age The grey contours trace the Vband image and the position of the
bright optical nucleus is indicated by a cross
Among the 400 clusters detected in the UV with WFPC2 45 are bright
enough to be detected also in the shallower V and I images enabling a study of
their age and mass distributions Harris et al 2001 Again colors and EWH
were used as complementary diagnostics for the age of the stellar clusters Fig-
ure 7 The basic result is that about 75 of the clusters more massive than
2104 M our low mass completeness limit are younger than 10 Myr and al-
most 50 are in the narrow age range 57 Myr No cluster older than 50 Myr
was detected although our images are deep enough for the purpose While the
57 Myr old clusters are distributed across the semi-annulus of star formation
clusters younger than 5 Myr are preferentially located at the edges of the annulus
Figure 8 This suggests that star formation has propagated from the interior
of the annulus to its perimeter The 57 Myr population has possibly evacu-
Calzetti  Harris
ated interstellar material from most of the semi-annulus and star formation is
continuing along the edges as also evidenced by the H morphology
Along the semi-annulus there is a trend for older clusters ages around 10
30 Myr Figure 8 to be located in the southern-most region where the largest
of the H bubbles is also located whereas the peak of the current star formation
is in the north-west area of the semi-annulus close to a major dust lane and to
the two mid-IR peaks Telesco et al 1993 This age sequence supports earlier
suggestions that star formation has been propagating along the semi-annulus
from the south to the north Gallais et al 1991 Puxley et al 1997
The full mass range for our clusters is 1038104 M and clusters more
massive than a few times 104 M are not expected to evaporate on timescales
shorter than a few tens of Myr Thus the peak in the number of 57 Myr old
clusters may suggest a true burst of activity in the recent past of the galaxy
This is consistent with evolution models already developed for the center of M83
Gallais et al 1991 Thatte et al 2000 molecular gas is fed to the center by
the main bar and once enough mass is accumulated star formation occurs
Typical sizes of the clouds would imply burst durations of 1030 Myr Efremov
 Elmegreen 1998 Possibly the current burst is a transitory are-up of circum-
nuclear star formation but if gas feeding of the center by the bar is recurrent
or continuous so would be the bursts of star formation The absence of clusters
older than 50 Myr in our images would suggest inter-burst periods 50 Myr
A more accurate understanding of the star formation history in the center of
M83 is currently hampered by our limitations in pinning down the nature of the
diuse UV light This is mainly driven by the lack of UV spectroscopic data For
instance if the UV spectra were to indicate that the diuse population is mainly
constituted of stars older than 50 Myr this would reinforce the case for a true
starburst nature of the 57 Myr old cluster population A diuse population
containing signatures of young Ostars would support a bimodal star formation
scenario in contrast with NGC5253 Presence of eld stars in the 1050 Myr
age range would re-open the question of whether the current starburst is a true
burst or simply part of a long duty-cycle event because the scarcity of clusters
older than 10 Myr could be ascribed to evaporation
4 Conclusions
Preliminary results from the starburst star formation history project indicate
that the morphological dierences between the starbursts in the dwarf NGC5253
and in the massive spiral M83 may reect dierences in their history as well
In particular the starburst in NGC5253 appears to be part of a time-extended
100 Myr event while the starburst in M83 could be a true burst of star for-
mation a short are-up that could be separated from the next one by more than
50 Myr The latter scenario is still under investigation and UV spectroscopy
will provide a nal answer
The next steps in the project include analysing the larger sample of star-
bursts in order to place the above results on a solid statistical footing and
address the questions posed in the Introduction
