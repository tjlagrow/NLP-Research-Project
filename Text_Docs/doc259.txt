1 Introduction
The purpose of the present review is not to extensively discuss all the recent developments
on galaxy formation and evolution As it can be seen below the literature on the subject
is abundant if not redundant Our attention will be centered on clues of secular dynamical
evolution in disk galaxies which can be detected by observations or suggested by numer-
ical simulations or theoretical approaches We will emphasize some fundamental physical
processes at work in this context as resonances torques energy dissipation dynamical
friction loss and gain of angular momentum accretion etc
The most signicant progresses in the eld come from considerations on facts still ne-
glected or not well understood in the past as the role of gas the interaction eects not
only between galaxies but also between various components of a given system the neces-
sity to take account of 3-D structures the star formation in competition with dynamical
processes
Recent observations as well as numerical experiments or theoretical developments sug-
gest that disk galaxies are the seat of evolutionary processes on time scales of the order of
the Hubble time or smaller We will not deal with galactic formation since another review
in the same journal will be devoted to this phase of evolution
We assume that the reader has had an introduction course in galactic dynamics and
is familiar with classical principles of stellar dynamics as well as hydrodynamics For
those readers who lack this basic knowledge we warmly recommend Galactic Dynamics
by Binney and Tremaine 1987 and a general review on hydrodynamics by Monaghan
1992
We begin section 2 by recalling the observed global properties of galaxies as well as
correlations between typical features along the well known Hubble sequence
In section 3 we review the fundamental tools of the galactic dynamics and the dierent
approaches such as orbit theory analytical developments and numerical simulations with
their qualities and failures The use of action-angle variables will be reintroduced in view
of applications in other sections
In section 4 we indicate more specically what we can learn from stellar orbit theory
on galactic evolution emphasizing concepts newly introduced in the eld in particular
in three dimensional problems such as complex instability or eects of a compact central
mass Chaotic orbital behavior will be mentioned as far as it can play a role in the secular
evolution of the systems
The problem of local and global instabilities of disks taking account of stars and gas
will be discussed in section 5 In this context arguments for suggesting cold gas as a main
constituent of the dark matter present in galaxies will be given
In section 6 we explore the interactions between various components of disk galaxies
disks spheroids bars and their consequences on the long term evolution
The dissipative evolution of disks due to the presence of gas is be discussed in section 7
on the basis of recent simulations using an N-body code coupled either with sticky particle
code or with smooth particle hydrodynamic code for gas behavior description Spiral
activity and gas fueling of galactic nuclei driven by bars will be studied
Galaxies evolve in various environments
Interactions are able to modify their mor-
phologies In section 8 the consequences of satellite accretions are examined as well as the
result of strong encounters of disks A correct treatment of dynamical friction in numerical
simulations is discussed
In section 9 we examine how the star formation can contribute to modify the ideas on
the long-term evolution of galaxies This part is still exploratory since a rigorous theory of
star formation taking account of the implied complex physical processes is not yet available
and one is constrained to introduce ad hoc assumptions for this purpose
By way of conclusion we give in section 10 some arguments in favor of a possible evo-
lution of galaxies along the Hubble sequence from late to early types due to the dynamical
processes previously described
Since our purpose is essentially to emphasize the clues of evolutionary dynamical pro-
cesses during the life of disk galaxies it is useful to close this introduction by referring the
reader to books which deal with the structure and evolution of galaxies in general or which
describe in more details some specic subjects which we will not be able to tackle here

2 Global observational properties of spiral galaxies
Whatever the origin of galaxy morphologies may be initial conditions or and result
of secular evolution the structural properties of dierent Hubble types correlated with
physical features have to be explained It is useful in our present context to draw up a
list of these properties One must pay attention to the fact that the basic morphological
elements of the Hubble sequence of spirals have been set forth by Sandage for bright
galaxies Moreover the morphological classication highly depends on the used passbands
Recent J H K photometry of galaxies conrms this evidence
1 Systematics of the galactic bulgedisk ratios carefully studied by Simien and de
Vaucouleurs 1986 conrms previous results according to which the mean fractional
luminosity of the bulge is a monotonic decreasing function of the Hubble type from
early lenticular types to late-types typically from 4 for Sa galaxies to 01 for Sc-d
galaxies
2 Kennicutt 1981 gave measurements of shapes and pitch angles  of spiral arms in
Sa-Sc galaxies A clear dependence of  on the absolute blue luminosity and Vrot
appears The result is in agreement with the increase of theoretical pitch angles from
early to late-type spirals inferred from the density wave theory by Roberts et al
1975
3 Strong bars strong in the sense of an important deviation to axisymmetry are
present in 13 of spirals and weak bars or ovals represent another third
Table 1 Percentage of barred galaxies of various Hubble types and dierent inclination

Bars are ubiquitous and certainly play an essential role in disk evolution as we will
see later It is interesting to note that these percentages do not vary very much in
various environments A maximum percentage of barred galaxies seems to exist in
Sb-Sbc types but we must be very careful with statistics concerning the morphological
types It is obviously easier to detect bars in face-on or nearly face-on galaxies We
separately give in Table 1 the fractions SBSA  SB as a function of the inclination
of the galactic disks with respect to the line of sight The de Vaucouleurs parameter
ba25 is equal to 1 for face-on objects and 0 for edge-on The intermediate class
SAB or X in the de Vaucouleurs notation is excluded from this statistics We can
say that the majority of galaxies must be barred or present an oval in the center if
we add the fact that photometric data in IR reveal bars which were not previously
observed in bluer band see for ex Elmegreen 1981
Early type galaxies seem to have larger bars relative to the galactic disk size than
late type galaxies The correlation between the size of bulges and the length of bars
found by Athanassoula and Martinet 1980 is conrmed by Baumgart and Peterson
1986
4 Hogg et al 1993 found a signicant tendency to an increase with the Hubble type
from Sas to Sds of the cool gas HI H2 dust
Fig 10 of an old paper by Roberts 1969 already displayed the same tendency for
MHIMT OT from less than 005 for Sa-Sabs to 010015 for SbcSds
5 From a series of papers by Rubin and collaborators see a synthesis of results in
1985 we have a relation between the optical maximum rotation
Rubin et al
velocity Vmax as well as the blue absolute magnitude and the Hubble type This
relation is conrmed by using HI rotation curves as shown by Zaritsky 1993 The
tendency is a hVmaxi decline from early to late types
6 The Tully-Fisher direct relation between the absolute luminosity and the maximum
rotation velocity Tully-Fisher 1977 shown in g 5 is another tendency in spiral
galaxies However this relation seems to be dependent on the pass-band as conrmed
by Gavazzi 1993 In infra-red there is less type-dependence contrarily to visible
7 The morphology of rotation curves may change according to the luminosity In the
context of the conspiracy problem between optical and dark matter in spirals see
section 53 Casertano and van Gorkom 1991 distinguished three kinds of rotation
curves as seen in one of their gures reproduced here g 1
Spiral galaxies occupy a limited band in the plane Vmax h where h is the disk
exponential scale length We have suggested that systems with Vmax h outside this
band would be dynamically strongly unstable see Martinet 1988
8 The central velocity dispersion 0 is also function of Hubble type Dressler and
Sandage 1983  0  varies from  115 kms1 for Sc  Sbcs galaxies to 170
kms1 for Sa and 220 kms1 for S0
9 The parameter Vmax0 indicates the ratio of systematic rotational motion to central
random motions in galaxies Whereas it is smaller than one for elliptical galaxies
it is larger than 1 for spirals But we do not nd any signicant variation with the
spiral Hubble type Typical values are 18 for Sas 16 for Sbs 17 for Scs
10 The distribution of integrated H  NII equivalent width of normal galaxies which
can be considered as an estimate of the current star formation rate SFR scaled to the
total red luminosity shows a strong trend with Hubble type The total SFR ranges
from 01 to 1 Myr1 in S0-a galaxies to 10 Myr1 in Sc-Irr galaxies Kennicutt
1983 The range of variation is larger if we take account of extreme dwarfs 0001
Myr1 and starbursts till more than 100 Myr1
11 The history of star formation is globally described by the parameter b  SF RdMd
where d is the age of the disk and Md its total mass b measures the ratio of the
current star formation rate to the average past rate It increases from 005 in Sa-Sabs
to 10 in Scs Kennicutt 1993
12 We will come back section 10 on the problem of dark matter for which some argu-
ments suggest that its quantity increases from Sas to Sc-ds
13 Zaritsky et al 1994 suggest that Sb-Sc galaxies may have steeper metal abundances
gradients than either earlier or later spirals Furthermore barred galaxies seem to
generally have atter gradients than unbarred galaxies But these results must be
conrmed on larger samples
Summarizing this section we retain numerous tendencies of physical features with the
Hubble type The bulge to disk ratio the maximum rotation velocity the core velocity
dispersion decrease from Sas to Scs But it is important to emphasize a large or even
very large scatter at each type or subtype The mass of cool gas the pitch angle of spiral
arms the current star formation increase from Sas to Scs Here also we must account
for large scatter inside each type or subtype
As mentioned above these tendencies have been observed on samples of giant and
supergiant galaxies the used catalogues are dominated by objects of high luminosity We
must not lose sight of the fact that Sa-Sbc types are much less frequent among dwarfs
than for all Shapley-Ames objects Amongst dwarfs Scd-Im galaxies represent 29 of the
sample compared to only 5 for all Shapley-Ames galaxies At present time we observe
objects from mostly unevolved disks Malin 1 presents a HI disk size of 05h1 Mpc 
to disks which have exhausted more than 99 of their gas In brief the whole galactic
evolution story goes beyond the frame of the giant galaxy correlations
3 Stellar dynamics in galaxies
For ten to twenty years studies in galactic dynamics mainly concentrated on the following
topics
1 Dark matter on which numerous questions remain unsolved what how much
2 Triaxiality of elliptical galaxies bulges of spirals and bars which is tractable in the
frame of dynamical systems with three degrees of freedom
3 Swing amplication of spiral waves described by Toomre 1981 which was presented
as one possible solution to the problem of persistence of the observed spiral structures
4 Interaction of galaxies the most spectacular eect of which being warps polar rings
shells bridges tails and mergers
5 Dissipative behavior of gas the importance of which is now recognized in the evolu-
tion problems
With respect to the simplications generally inherent in classical purely stellar dy-
namics analytical treatments of galactic dynamics the topics mentioned above introduce
various levels of complexity Dark matter is not necessarily conservative as suggested in
section 53 triaxiality introduces new phenomena in orbital behavior section 4 swing
amplication and interactions between galaxies as well as between components of a given
galaxy imply non-stationnarity asymmetries coupling of dissipative gaseous and conserva-
tive stellar components hence coupling of hydrodynamics and stellar dynamics It is clear
that one can try to succeed in understanding such a complexity only by using numerical
calculations as we will show in the next sections Nevertheless it is not useless to recall
here some of the fundamentals concepts of classical galactic dynamics
31 Fundamentals of classical galactic dynamics
An analytical description of a galaxy can be tried by using a set of relations between
the stellar density distribution x t  0 the potential x t and the phase density
F x v t  0 where x and v are respectively the position and velocity vectors These
relations are implicitly described by the Boltzmann equation B and the Poisson equation
v  
2x t  4Gx t
Moreover
x t  Zv
F x v tdv
where v is the velocity space
If x t is the observed density or an imposed density imp P gives the corre-
sponding imposed potential B gives in principle the phase density response and the third
equation the density response resp The self-consistency condition implies imp  resp
In B such as written the evolution due to stellar encounters Ftenc is ignored It
is generally admitted that in galactic dynamics the inuence of encounters implying stars
is negligible taking account the fact that the 2-body relaxation time trel  V 3Nm1m2
Henon 1973 would be much larger than the age of the system V is the star typical relative
velocity m1 and m2 the respective masses of test and eld objects However encounters of
giant molecular clouds with stars could be eective to heat disks of spirals and contribute
to Ftenc 6 0 so that B without second member would be only justied for time
scales less than some 108 years Furthermore even if Ftenc is ignored a system could
have a collisionless evolution which is revealed by numerical simulations as well as by the
observations The collective relaxation certainly plays a role in the secular evolution of
disks in particular
Exact analytical solutions of the integro-dierential system B  P have been found
only in particular stationary cases of symmetries such as spherical systems with F E or
F E J 2 or innitely thin axisymmetric disks with F E JZ Actually disks are generally
not axisymmetric they are perturbed by spiral or bar components and they are not very
thin Then
  R  z t
  R  z t
F  F R  z vR v vz t
with a stationary zero order possible solution
0R z
0R z
F0R z vR v vz
If the disk is thick or if we look for a solution for a axisymmetric galaxy including a
halo we have the additional problem of the third integral F E Jz where E  1
z  J 2
r2 R z and Jz  rv is not compatible with the velocity distribution in the solar
neighborhood where the observations suggest that the velocity dispersion ratio Rz  2
In principle the phase density should be written as a function of a set of isolating
distinct integrals Jeans Theorem Literature is rich in discussions on the diculty to
realize this end beyond the classical integrals of energy E and angular momentum Jz in
the axisymmetric case Only by having recourse numerically to the Poincare method of
surface of section it was possible to partially clear up the problem of integrability of
specic potentials An exemplary case was explored by Henon and Heiles 1964
general dynamical models such as those which are able to represent real galaxies are non-
integrable in the sense that there exists always a subspace of the phase space occupied by
chaotic orbits in such systems see also section 4
For an up-to-date review of the integrability of galaxy models see ie de Zeeuw 1988
Because of the diculties to solve the system B  P or to nd explicit form for
F x v in terms of integrals one resorted for a long time to the Jeans equations Stellar
hydrodynamic equations obtained by multiplying B by vk
i with k  0 and 1 and integrat-
ing on the velocity space Some useful relations between the density of a stellar population
the moments of the velocity distribution and the radial or perpendicular forces KR and Kz
have been obtained For various applications to problems of galactic structure such as the
asymmetrical drift the motions perpendicular to the galactic plane and the determination
of the galactic mass from the kinematics of globular clusters in our Galaxy or the relation
between the azimuthal systematic motions and the shape of spheroidal systems cf Bin-
ney and Tremaine 1987 The drawback of the method consists in the impossibility to
close the system of equations without introducing arbitrary hypothesis with regard to the
moments of F  But see a recent method suggested by Amendt and Cuddeford 1991 to
overcome this diculty
The introduction of perturbations in the fundamental equations of the self-consistent
problem mentioned above very quickly gives cumbersome expressions even if one makes
use of the fact that apparently spiral perturbations for instance are small with respect to
the axisymmetric eld The linearisation of the equations in this case has been considered
as an adequate approximation of the rst order
We have
  0  1  
 F  F0  F1  
   0  1  
where 0 is an imposed axisymmetric potential and 1 equal an imposed spiral or weak
bar perturbation 1  0 1  0 F1  F0
B becomes DF0 0  DF1 0  DF0 1  0
A zero order solution is given by solving DF0 0  0 The rst order solution is
obtained from the equation
If 1 is known for ex
DF1 0  DF0 1
1R  t  Xm
1mRexpit  m
where m represents the symmetry of components for a spiral m  number of arms
we will formally have F1  R DF0 1dt where the integration is performed along the
unperturbed orbits DF1  is non-linear Non-linear eects in spiral cases are weak in
general except for resonance regions which will be described right below
Calculations lead to denominators in F1 in the form of

or   2 respectively corresponding to the Inner ILR and Outer OLR Lindblad
Resonances They are the most important resonances in the galactic disks They play
a signicant role when a perturbation to the axisymmetric case is present A star at
resonance meets the perturbation pattern always at the same point on its orbit so that a
cumulative perturbation eect is to expect It is necessary to stress that these resonances
are dened in the frame of a theory of small motions around circular orbits In the presence
of a strong bar the frequencies R and R as well as the vertical frequency zR
do not rigorously represent the actual orbit frequencies inside the bar
Strong bars axis ratio larger than 15 - 2 cannot be treated in the frame of the
linearized equations Non-linear eects are important Orbits present large deviations with
respect to the familiar epicyclic orbits of the axisymmetric case Fig 2 shows some typical
resonant periodic orbits in perturbed systems numerically calculated For the description
of non-linear theory at the ILR the reader is referred to a review by Contopoulos and
Grosbl 1989
The previous discussion shows that the analytical approach of the self-gravitating prob-
lem in disk galaxies is attended by large diculties Recently two numerical methods have
been proposed to obtain a self-consistent solution for spiral or barred galaxies The rst
one Contopoulos and Grosbl 1989is based on the existence and the shape of periodic
orbits in spiral galaxies The other used by Pfenniger 1984b for the construction of 2-D
self-gravitating barred galaxies is a variant of the Schwarzschild 1979 linear program-
ming approach to obtain equilibrium model of elliptical galaxies Both methods consider
various kinds of possible orbits and the time they spend in various regions of the system
A fortiori the treatment of dynamical evolution of the galaxies with time is out of
reach by analytical methods This justies the use of numerical simulations on computers
of galaxy evolution with the help of N-body and hydrodynamical codes This approach
already allowed to treat a lot of problems concerning the equilibrium the stability and the
evolution of disk galaxies such as those described in section 5 and the next ones
32 Angle-action variables
The formalism of angle-action variables was introduced by Born 1927 It appeared in
galactic dynamics in papers by Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972 and Lynden-Bell 1973
It has been proved to work in various problems connected to the disk evolution a orbital
behavior of stars belonging to the spheroidal component of a galaxy during the slow forma-
tion of the disk Binney and May 1986 b trapping of orbits in the potential sink of a bar
Lynden-Bell 1973 and 1979 c dynamics of resonances in spirals and bars Contopou-
los 1988 d evolution of barred galaxies by dynamical friction Weinberg 1985 e the
exchange of angular momentum between a bar and a disk Little and Carlberg 1991 f
the dynamical interaction between a bar and a spheroid Hernquist and Weinberg 1992
In some cases it is cumbersome to go beyond a linear treatment but this formalism gives
some useful insight on the reality of the mentioned processes We will come back in next
sections on some of the most recent applications of the formalism
A suitable set of angle-action variables I1 w1 I2 w2 for galactic disks is dened as
follows
With Rh  radius of the circular orbit corresponding to the angular momentum h
R1  R  Rh  asinw1 w1 is the radial oscillation phase
I1  12a2  ER  Eh  is a function of the radial amplitude
w2 is the galactocentric angle to an epicenter in uniform motion
I2  h  angular momentum
For a thick disk a third action is introduced I3 is a function of the perpendicular
amplitude of motion  Ezz where z is the frequency of the perpendicular motion to
which corresponds wz  latitudinal angle  perpendicular oscillation phase
For a perturbed system HI w  H0I  H1I w the equations of motion are
I  wH1I w
w  IH0I  IH1I w

the Hamiltonian being explicitly H  0  1  ph where p is the angular velocity of
the spiral or bar perturbation
For example 1  PmPnmn cosmw1  nw2  mn sinmw1  nw2
A useful property of the actions is their adiabatic invariance in cases of slow time
variation of potentials
This consideration has been exploited for instance by Lynden-Bell 1979 in an very
elegant treatment of the trapping of quasi-resonant orbits by a bar
4 What can we learn from studies of stellar orbits
Introduction
From simplicity to complexity studies of stellar orbits in galaxies can be tackled according
to the three following approaches
1 Study of orbits in a given potential
The aim is to obtain a classication of main types of orbits existing in a given system
in particular the periodic orbits This approach is able to bring constraints on the
real existence of such a system and that in so far as the shape of some orbits is
not always compatible with the geometry of the imposed density prole as explained
below In this approach the collective eects are neglected so that some results need
conrmation by N-body simulations for instance the problem of the disc instabilities
perpendicular to the galactic plane section 64
2 Response of a given population to any perturbation
This approach implies the calculation of the time spent by the orbits in given regions
and allows to study mechanisms which explain some observed structures as rings
resulting from trapping of matter at some resonances or thickening of disks
3 If in the frame of the previous approach we succeed to nd a response in density
equivalent to the imposed density for some particular weighting of the various kinds
of possible orbits we can claim to construct a self-gravitating equilibrium model as
already mentioned in section 31
In this section we will show that the study of orbital behaviors in given systems is a
complementary approach to other ways of analyzing the structure and the evolution of
the galaxies
In particular the question of the importance of chaotic orbits in galactic
potentials has been the subject of numerous investigations in the recent past what is the
permissible percentage of such orbits in various morphological types of galaxies if they have
to be considered as self-gravitating equilibrium systems
Let us begin by a question of terminology Roughly spoken a system is called ergodic
if any trajectory except for a set of null measures lls densely its energy surface The
sequence of intersection points in a space of section Poincare1899 corresponding to such
an ergodic trajectory would ll densely this space of section In spite of the widely-held
use of the term of ergodicity in works dealing with galactic dynamics problems ergodic
orbits strictly as such are not found in smooth realistic as well as in noisy models of
galaxies Apart from very peculiar cases at the very most we may speak about chaotic
behavior in some regions of phase space Some other adjectives are also used in literature
irregular wild erratic semi-ergodic This behavior implies that in a space of section
the sequence of points corresponding to the trajectory jumps more or less randomly in the
fraction of space left open by the invariant curves which correspond in contrast to a regular
behavior In fact as often as not a chaotic behavior is characterized by the presence of
cantori which by any means are not to be confused with ergodicity
See Percival 1989 for an introduction to the concept of cantori and Henon 1981 for
a clear description of the surface of section method and applications to various dynamical
systems
Interaction of resonances Heteroclinic orbits
Gerhard 1985 looked for the perturbations H1 of integrable Hamiltonians H0 which
are consistent with observations of early-type galaxies as well as approximately preserving
the regular orbital structure of integrable potentials Limiting his treatment to small
perturbations and to homoclinic orbits in order to be able to use the Melnikov integral
technique the author nds that only perturbations such as cos mm  0 2 4 modest
ellipticity gradients or small gure rotation are working in this context However it seems
to be clear that in realistic systems a chaotic behavior can be amplied by resonance
interactions and the presence of heteroclinic orbits Such a situation was described in
the inner regions of an axisymmetric model of our Galaxy for stars with small angular
momentum Martinet 1974
Evidence for chaos triggered by resonance interactions in triaxials models of galaxies
has been given by Martinet  Udry 1990 in connection with the adopted morphology
for these systems Orbits were systematically studied in slowly rotating modied Hubble
prole models of various axis ratios a  b  c I a nearly spherical one II a Schwarzschild
model 1  0625  05 III a strongly triaxial one 1  06  015 and IV a bar 1  025 
0125 Surfaces of section as well as the rotation number rot attached to invariant curves
have been obtained for dierent values of the Hamiltonian An example is given in Fig 3
for model II Rational values of rot correspond to resonant periodic orbits When the
orbits are not regular it is impossible to dene rot the invariant curves are dissolved
without ambiguity bottom gure and discontinuities in rot x appear indicating the
range of resonances in interaction responsible of chaotic behavior apparent in the surface
of section top gure
The main result of this investigation is that only models I and II show moderate chaotic
regions cantori with not really detected resonance interactions possibly conned to a very
narrow range of rational numbers On the contrary models III and IV develop important
chaotic regions for model IV for ex resonances in the range 15  rot  23 are implied
in the set-up of chaos Figure 4 shows that in an existence diagram of axis ratios our models
I and II are located in the region occupied by real triaxial galaxies or bulges various
symbols according to predictions inferred from observations On the contrary the highly
triaxial models III and IV are in a region devoided of such real systems This could be a
sketch of constraints on the possible shape of triaxial galaxies We must notice that N-body
equilibrium gures obtained by gravitational collapse of initial rotating anisotropic bodies
have ba from 05 to 1 and ca  045 Udry 1992 also in agreement with observational
predictions
It is the same for Barnes 1992 products of mergers Too highly triaxial
objects might not exist because real equilibrium systems would not tolerate too much
43 Eects of asymmetries or noise on the orbital behavior in
triaxial systems
The gravitational attraction of a co-rotating nearby body is able to deform the shape of
orbits in the given systems dened above In particular instead of having a main stable
orbit x1 which bifurcates into two stable branches for ex Martinet  Zeeuw 1988 the
asymmetry triggered by an eccentric Plummer sphere leads to a continuous deviation of
x1 from the plane gradually becoming a banana-shaped orbit Udry 1991 We will come
back below to the problems rising from the existence of this kind of centrophobic orbits
The addition of a high frequency sinusoidal function to the given potential to represent
some noise locally modies the isodensity contours Udry suggested the following form
  01   sin Xi
for a noisy 3-D potential 0 is the potential dened in the previous section Hubble prole
model As shown in Fig 5 displaying surfaces of section for several cases of the amplitude
 and the frequencies ki of the noise in the 2-D case chaotic behavior is favored by such
perturbations As  and or ki increase the invariant curves become thicker and are then
progressively destroyed See also Pfenniger and Friedli 1991
44 Complex instability in triaxial systems
This is one of the new orbital behavior which appear in dynamical system with three degrees
of freedom Magnenat and Martinet 1983 It consists of the fact that the Jacobian matrix
associated with the linearized transformation describing the motion close to a periodic
orbit has all its eigenvalues complex and outside the unit circle Real eigenvectors do
not exist This behavior was mentioned by Broucke 1969 in the 3-body problem and
emphasized by Magnenat 1982 for the case of cubic potential Important zones of complex
instabilities have been found in rather academic potentials Contopoulos and Magnenat
1985 Pfenniger 1985 found complex unstable tridimensional periodic orbits in a large
range of energy and parameters in a model of barred galaxy
It is not clear in which
situations complex instability would produce a great amount of chaotic motions
We mention here a case which could be interesting for the equilibrium and the stability
of real galaxies Ordinarily four main sequences of periodic orbits are considered for a
specic triaxial slowly rotating system the stable anomalous orbits tipped relatively to
the equatorial plane and circling the long axis the unstable anomalous inclined orbits
which circle the intermediate axis the normal stable retrograde orbits in the equatorial
plane and the z-axis orbits The z-axis orbits are stable s in the inner part then become
simply unstable u against perturbations parallel to the intermediate axis and still further
out become doubly unstable du against additional perturbations parallel to the long axis
There four sequences are interconnected in a way described by g 1 of the paper by Heissler
et al 1982 Martinet and Pfenniger 1987 studied the stability of the z-axis orbit when
the gure rotation and the shape of the system change The sequence of bifurcations
mentioned above is modied and the onset of complex instability at high energies on the
family of z-axis orbits is fairly general for rotating triaxial stellar systems For a gure
rotation large enough the direct transition of stability to complex instability prevents the
stable anomalous orbits from joining the z-axis Let us consider a 3-D barred potential
axisymmetric background plus a Ferrers bar such as used by Pfenniger 1984a to which
a Plummer sphere is added to represent a condensed massive object at the center of the
system It is observed that even a very small mass concentration Mp in the core amplies
the complex instability the critical value of the Hamiltonian at which the transition stable
 complex unstable occurs is lowered For a value of MpMtot  00006 the z-axis orbit is
practically fully complex unstable from z  0 The eect of such an instability is described
in Fig 6 the importance of stochastic diusion of orbits starting near the z-axis is
increasing with the central Plummer sphere mass The diusion time by this process could
be shorter than the Hubble time if the central mass makes the most of the z-axis unstable
It seems possible that by the association of a central small mass and a rotating bar which
both create a large number of stochastic orbits bulges may grow secularly through the
enhanced diusion of stochastic orbits Of course other stochasticity-producing events
like mergers may happen in the life of a galaxy The exact diusion speed is sensitively
dependent on small perturbations Since real galaxies are much less smooth symmetric and
steady than the potentials above we can expect that the stochastic diusion is probably
even faster in real galaxies than in the present models However in the approach described
here as in all calculations where orbits are studied in given xed potentials the collective
processes are not taken into account so that only N-body simulations are able to give a
more specic idea of the mentioned eects
45 Barred galaxies
Detailed numerical calculations of stellar orbits in given barred potentials have been a
cornerstone for understanding the dynamics of SB galaxies which has recently been exten-
sively reviewed by Sellwood  Wilkinson 1993 Here we summarize again some important
conclusions inferred from recent works about the relation between the shape of bars and
the onset of chaos
The essential point is that if the axis ratio of the bar in the plane of the disk is larger
than 3 to 4 andor the mass of the bar is larger than 14 of the total mass inside corota-
tion an extended chaotic region can occur in the inner parts of the galaxy and that the
corresponding orbits cannot enhance the bar anymore The stability of the main periodic
orbit x1 along the bar is necessary to maintain the barred structure for details of the 2-D
case see for ex Athanassoula et al 1983 or Contopoulos and Papayannopoulos 1980
These results suggest that models with the properties just mentioned should be excluded
for a self-gravitating barred galaxy As indicated in the introduction such predictions need
to be conrmed taking account of collective eects
The eect of a compact mass at the center of a galaxy has been reported by Hasan 
Norman 1990 and references therein The percentage of phase space volume occupied
by direct orbits along the bar decreases from 50 in absence of such a compact mass or
if the axis ratio ab of the bar is  2 to 1015 for instance if the compact mass is one
tenth of the total mass or if ab  4
At the present time the only equilibrium model existing for a 2-D barred galaxy is
the numerical one constructed by Pfenniger 1984b
In this work it is shown that the
percentage of semi-ergotic stars may be as large as 30 but more probably below 10
if the axis ratio is 4 and the mass of the bar is 15 of the total mass Locally however
around the Lagrangian points at the end of the bar they can be 100
For a 3-D barred galaxy the estimation of the percentage of chaotic orbits is more com-
plicated From Pfenniger 1984a it appears that semi-ergodicity is favored by instability
strips perpendicular to the galactic plane The bar growth is limited if axis ratios ab and
ac are too large A too thin bar ac  10 induces a lot of chaos In a 3-D strongly
barred galaxy the resonant family 4  4  1 has been proved to have a complex unstable
part Pfenniger 1985 The resulting orbital diusion could be a possibility to populate
the inner halo see 46 Much work is necessary to estimate the permissible percentage
of chaotic orbits in this case 3-D equilibrium models do not exist at present time in
particular because vertical density structure of bars is weakly constrained by observations
46 Boxlets
For a wide class of non-rotating triaxial potentials most of the phase space is occupied
by four well known major families box inner and outer long axis tubes short axis tubes
The x-axis periodic family is generic for the boxes provided that it is stable Boxes appear
essential for the construction of equilibrium models of triaxial systems However if there
is sharp variation of the density prole near the center x-axis orbits can be unstable
Centrophilic boxes could be replaced by centrophobic boxlets such as bananas Miralda-
Escude  Schwarzschild 1989
Two points about boxlets need further investigations rstly the fact that this shape is
not always compatible with the shape of the imposed density This may cause a problem
for the construction for equilibrium models Secondly if the boxlets are unstable they can
participate to diusion of chaotic behavior The question concerning what percentage of
such orbits is permissible for the construction of self-gravitating systems is still open This
question is still more complicated for rotating systems Martinet  Udry 1990
47 Concluding remarks
In conclusion we can summarize what we can learn from orbit calculation in imposed
galactic potentials
- Existing morphologies of galaxies seem to be incompatible with too high percentages
of semi-ergodic orbits Slowly rotating triaxial dynamical models with a major to
minor axis ac ratio larger than 25 or fast rotating barred systems with axis ra-
tio ab larger than 3 or 4 display important chaotic behaviors Systems with such
morphological features are in fact apparently not observed
- Association of a compact central mass and a rotating bar which creates a large
number of chaotic orbits can trigger a secular growth of bulges by enhanced diusion
of there orbits
- 3-D N-body bars in disks have axis ratios ab  4 That corresponds to systems for
which the orbital calculations predict a moderate percentage of semi-ergodic orbits
- Quantitative estimations of percentages of semi-ergodic orbits in 3-D systems com-
patible with observed morphologies of barred galaxies is an open question
- Response to a given potential is not sucient for answering the question of the
permissible percentage of chaotic orbits in various morphological types Furthermore
galaxies evolve bars may grow then dissolve Ellipticals may accrete Gas and its
various interactions with stars star formation gaseous response stellar winds etc
contribute to modify the structure of the systems Does the secular evolution lead
such systems to a state close to an integrable potential with modest percentage of
chaotic orbits as suggested by Gerhard 1985
5 Stability of disks
In the present section we will remind some considerations on the local and the global
stability of stellar disks Then we will examine how the stability criteria are altered by the
presence of gas That will serve as a preamble to the description of the eects of gas inow
towards the central regions in section 7
51 Local stability of stellar disks against axisymmetric
perturbations in terms of radial distance to the center
The well known criterion introduced by Toomre 1964 indicates that stellar disks are
stable against local radial perturbations if
Rmin
RRR
kGR  1
where  is the epicyclic frequency R the projected surface density and k a constant
which is equal to 336 for a innitely thin stellar sheet 26 for a not innitely thin disk
with zR  6 Vandervoort 1970 and 29 if the galaxy contains  10 in mass of
gas Toomre 1974 For some galaxies k could be higher so that we maintain k as a free
parameter for the moment but later we will often refer to the standard value of 336
As soon as Q  1 the Jeans instability modes are suppressed The criterion has
been applied frequently to particular galaxies ie Kormendy 1984 van der Kruit and
Freeman 1986 Bottema 1988 The inuence of various factors on the radial behavior
QR in disks has been discussed by Martinet 1988 and Bottema 1993 We discuss
below some of their conclusions But let us remind without delay that even if Q  1 the
disk can be violently unstable against non-axisymmetric global perturbations and develop
massive bars It is a result of numerous numerical simulations In fact a really satisfactory
criterion of global stability against the formation of bars does not exist at the present
time in spite of several tentatives Ostriker and Peebles 1974 Efstathiou et al 1982
Although dark halos have often been used to explain the mechanism of stabilization some
more recent numerical experiments by way of a N-body code Athanassoula and Sellwood
1986 have shown that halos do not represent the cure-all in this context and that a
disk which is suciently hot in its central parts could prevent the growth of a bar in
some cases The result of their N-body model seems to indicate that Q  2 - 25 might
be a global stability criterion The hQi values given in recent literature for individual
galaxies see Bottema 1993 and reference therein could certainly suer from more or
less uncertainties due to badly determined quantities such as the mass-to-light ratio in
the disc or the central luminosity density L00 Nevertheless the parameter Q remains a
powerful tool for the estimate of the discs temperature and it is therefore important to
understand its behavior under various structural conditions specied below Furthermore
a better appreciation of the possible values of Q as a function of the distance to the
center R can be helpful Let us consider the following models for the density distribution
perpendicular to the galactic plane
z  22nesech2nnzze
Two extreme cases are n 1 isothermal case and n   exponential case For the
isothermal case the surface density at distance R from the center is
R  2Z 
R 0sech2zz0dz
 2z0R 0
with z0  2ze and 0  e4
In such a case the velocity dispersion in the z-direction is given by
z R  2GR 0z2
 GRz0
In these formulas z0 is an estimate of the constant height of the disk The distribution
of light in the old disk is van der Kruit and Searle 1981

Furthermore the following expression for V R can t reasonably well many observed
rotation curves
In this case
R2  R2
V R  Vmaxvuut
R  2VmaxqR2  2R2

Taking account of these relations we can rewrite the equation for Q in the form
Q  264

R2  R2
mqR2  2R2
with Vmax expressed in kms1 L00 in 102Lpc3 R in kiloparsecs   Rz  2
and R  3h for late-type spirals without large bulges
This formula is valid in the region where the model is applicable ie between R  h
Figure 7 compares the behavior of F R Rm h factor Q containing R for two cases
Rm  0 and Rm  h assuming  as well as MLD constant It is generally admitted
that ML is constant in the whole disc on the basis of some data on the colors However
we cannot exclude a variation of MLD with R If the central parts are redder than the
outer ones ML could decrease considerably from the center to the edge so that Q could
increase more strongly with R Further if we suppose Q  const as it has often been
assumed MLD behaves like

Adopting a value of 14 kpc for Rm considered as independent of the brightness of a

adopting ML  20 for all the galaxies This gure reproduced from Fig 11 of Bottemas
1993 paper shows a very good agreement between the relation adopted above and the
observational values for MLB  28 or for Q between 2 and 25 Assuming that the
central velocity dispersion of disks is not very dierent from values of 0 observed by
Whitmore at al
1985 for the bulges and using values of Vmax given by Corradi and
Capaccioli 1991 for about thirty galaxies we have constructed a similar diagram which
gives the same agreement
For the model previously dened we can estimate the ratio of the radial  to perpen-
dicular z frequencies as a function of R

For example with   2 and k  336

This result is independent of the MLB ratio as well as of L00 The behavior of z
versus R is easily deduced from that of Q
In a attened galaxy we expect that 
 1 on a large range of R except for the central
parts Therefore Q ought to be smaller that 265 in order to satisfy this condition If k 
29 instead of 336 the condition becomes Q  3 If k  26 Q  34
The case Q  265 is interesting because the resulting z  11 is a case of resonance
coupling between the perpendicular and the plane motions for eccentric orbits in an ax-
isymmetric or triaxial galaxy Binney 1981 which is able to trigger a secular evolution of
the system by way of an excursion of orbits out of the galactic plane However the impor-
tance of the process can only be tested by N-body simulations which take the collective
eects into account
It is easy to show and interesting to note that if we replace the isothermal model by
the exponential one n   or better by an intermediate one n  2 the last relation
between z and Q is unchanged
It remains to explain how the stellar velocity dispersion in disks can reach values which
lead to Q  1 to 2 Our Galaxy gives the unique opportunity to study in details the
kinematic properties of stars systematic and residual motions especially in the solar
neighborhood in the external galaxies kinematical data are restricted to rotation curves
central los velocity dispersions and for several objects Bottema 1993 the variation
of the radial or perpendicular velocity dispersion in terms of the distance to the center
We have no simultaneous access to the components in the usual preferential directions
R  z as it is the case in our Galaxy Now these data are important to constrain the
possible processes responsible of the disk heating
52 Disk heating in our Galaxy
The relation age-kinematics for stars in the solar neighborhood which is an undisputed
evidence for the disk heating has been repeatedly discussed in the past An extensive
review has been published by Lacey 1991 From it we will retain recent observational
data and briey discuss some of the scenarios suggested to explain the increase of velocity
dispersion with age in the galactic disk
The estimation of stellar ages put diculties for oldest stars age higher than 2 bil-
lions years The selection of stellar groups near the main sequence according to the color
index or the spectral type gives only very rough results The chromospheric activity con-
cerns essentially K stars At present the most eective method is based on the u b v y
Stromgren photometry added to isochrones of stellar evolution models for B to F spectral
types but the squeezing of the isochrones on a range of color index corresponding to an age
range between 3 and 10 billions years induces large uncertainties on the individual ages
An age-kinematics relation has been obtained by Carlberg et al 1985 from a sample
of 225 F dwarfs and by Stromgren 1987 from 558 population I dwarfs and 1294 stars
of any heavy element abundance Clearly there is a disagreement between these recent
relations and the older ones Wielen 1977 for ages larger than 2 109 years A part
of this disagreement comes from the choice of the galactic age 15 109 years for recent
determination 10 109 years for the older The law of variation of the velocity dispersion
 in term of age is
   1p
0  C p
with p  05 for the old data and 02 - 03 for the new ones As for the velocity dispersion
ratios in terms of age it is not indicated to use them as strong constraints for physical
process models because of their high error bars Average values are R    z  1 
06003  32003 A third group of data should be explained by a correct model
it is the radial dependence of R or z At the present time only the
of disk heating
local kinematics has been used to test the various mechanisms suggested which we will
now enumerate Of course these mechanisms concern any galactic disk but are only
constrained by local observations
a Diusion by massive gas clouds
Analytical investigations and numerical simulations lead to an estimate of orbital
diusion time by 2-body starcloud encounters
dif f 
G2cMcln  10  109 years
with   30 kms1 c  01 Mpc3 Mc  cloud average mass  106M and 
the Coulomb logarithm There exists a population of molecular clouds with these
properties Because the diusion transfers the energy between radial and perpendic-
ular oscillations and increases on average corresponding energies to the detriment of
the systematic circular motions this process implies a velocity isotropisation which
contradicts the observed values zR  05 It also predicts  1010 years  20
kms1 whereas the old disk has   50 kms1
b Diusion by spiral density waves
This process proposed by Toomre 1964 and numerically investigated by various
authors for ex Sellwood and Carlberg 1984 and references therein is exposed to
a diculty due to the fact that the stability of disks is very sensitive to the velocity
dispersion If R is too weak spiral waves or bars develop but because of the eld
uctuations  increases and Q becomes of the order of 2 after 109 years Then the
disk is too hot to maintain the spiral structure The dissipation in gas or a continuous
accretion of matter are able to reduce this eect but one must cope with the problem
of maintaining the spiral arms for a long time Furthermore spiral modes found by
analytical or numerical investigation seem to be unable to heat the whole disk The
suggestion of recurrent instabilities by Sellwood and Lin 1989 could be a solution
However Carlberg 1987 found that vertical heating by the process invoked does not
work by lack of conspiration between the radial and the perpendicular frequencies
In general  m  p   and z  2-3 But see sect 6 for barred galaxies
c Combined eect of spirals and clouds
The respective failures of the previous processes led Carlberg 1987 and Jenkins and
Binney 1990 to consider the combined eect of both A stochastic acceleration
described by Fokker - Planck diusion equation is produced For a clear setting-up
of this equation cf Henon 1973 The ratio zR depends on a parameter  which
represents the ratio of the heating actions by spiral wave and cloud diusion   
0 when the later acts alone A good agreement with observations is obtained for
  90 which represents a spiral perturbation of the potential   11 kms12 
Then R  t with   05 and z  t with   03
The resulting F vz is Gaussian However better observational data with more ac-
curate age calibration are necessary in particular to specify the value of  Let us
note that in fact molecular clouds are a small scale limit of a chaotic spiral struc-
ture Finally the self-gravitation of the disk should be taken into account Heating
induces the disk thickening then density decreases what induces an adiabatic cooling
whereas matter accretion on the disk can trigger the formation of new stars which
increases density inducing an adiabatic heating
d Heating of disks by satellite accretions
This process will be examined in section 8 devoted to environmental eects on the
internal dynamical evolution of disks
e Heating by vertical resonances
This process will be described in section 64
53 Stability of a two-uid system against axisymmetric and
nonaxisymmetric perturbations
A real galaxy consisting of stars and gas it is important to study the physical eects of
gas inclusion on the stability
Local gravitational instabilities in a two-component system gas and stars obviously
depends on the parameters of both gas and stellar uids A condition of neutral stability
has been given by Jog and Solomon 1984 in the form of the dispersion relation

the rst and the second terms corresponding respectively to stars and gas with k  wave
number g  sound speed in the gas   velocity dispersion of stars Even a small
gaseous fraction less than 10 - 20 of the total disk density signicantly decreases the
stability of disks against axisymmetric perturbations An important extension of this work
has been recently published by Jog 1992 who studied the growth of non-axisymmetric
perturbations in disks represented as two-uid systems The underlying phenomenon pre-
viously studied for one-component cases and called swing amplication by Toomre 1981
and references therein results from a conspiration of three eects shearing due do the
dierential rotation shaking due to the epicyclic motions and self-gravity of the matter
involved Tagger et al 1994 add a fourth factor the thickness of the disk
In her treatment Jog assumes that the stellar s and gaseous g components are two
isothermal uids with surface density i i  s or g and sound velocity or 1-D velocity
dispersion ci cg  cs 0 and 0 are the unperturbed density and potential in an innitely
thin disk supported by the dierential rotation and residual motions of both uids The
uid representation is considered as relevant for local analysis far from resonances if the
shearing is not too important The mathematical treatment is simplied However in a
more rigorous approach the isothermal assumption for the stellar velocity distribution has
to be dropped and the viscosity of the gas has to be taken into account
We quote here the main points of the formalism used by Jog The Euler equation in
an uniformly rotating frame are
 Vi  Vi  
0ii  s  g  2  Vi  2r
where Vi is the 2-D uid velocity with respect to rotating axes
It is a matter of studying the dynamics of a local region around a point r0 0 corotat-
ing in the dened frame when a perturbation   is introduced The Euler continuity
and Poisson equations can successively be written by using sheared comoving axes coor-
dinates x y z t as

A trial solution has been introduced proportional to expikxx  kyy The equation
must be solved to obtain s and g as functions of time given their initial values
It is illuminating to have Eulers equations rewritten for i  i0i and after substi-
tution of Poisson equation into them

We clearly see in the brackets the terms respectively corresponding to the epicyclic
motion the shear and the uid pressure whereas the right hand side corresponds to the
self-gravity of the s  g two-uid system
From this equation following a mode evolution from a leading feature   0 to a

the s and g equations are weakly coupled 2 For   0 epicyclic and shearing terms
become important eventually with cancellation for a at rotation curve If the self-gravity

back an oscillatory solution 3 The coupling between both uids is higher at low

analysis is reduced to the dispersion relation for the axisymmetric case obtained by Jog

  01 X 1  1 The two-uid system is stable to axisymmetric perturbations The
amplication is higher in the gas with a more highly wound spiral feature
Other cases shown in Jogs paper indicate the dependence of the solution on the men-
tioned parameters and lead to the following important conclusion Growth of non axisym-
metric perturbations in a real galaxy may occur even if the system is stable against axisym-
metric perturbations andor if either uid component is stable against non-axisymmetric
component
We add that according to the fact that the process is more eective when the gas
fraction is high it must be more important in late-type galaxies
54 Global stability of disks and the dark matter problem
The essential of what we know on the large scale instabilities or stability of disks has been
obtained through N-body simulations In the early seventies two kinds of related results
appeared simultaneously whereas the rst at rotation curves were published suggesting
the presence of hidden forms of matter in isolated galaxies seminal papers by Miller and
Prendergast 1968 and Hohl and Hockney 1969 presented N-body simulations of disk
galaxies in view of explaining the formation and the maintenance of spiral structures in
the disks At that time the galactic astronomers were focused on the linear density wave
theory Lin and Shu 1964 Goldreich and Lynden-Bell 1965 concerning tightly wound
spirals
The central problem for people working on N-body numerical experiments was to sup-
press these strong bars which form spontaneously in the simulations in order to obtain the
well dened grand design spiral structure so often observed and well explained by the
density wave theory In fact in the seventies bars were not much studied and practically
not observed in details with the noticeable exception of de Vaucouleurs who insisted many
times on their importance in the spiral classication A further motivation to ignore them
was that bars could hardly be included in the density wave theory
Essentially two solutions were often considered to prevent the formation of bars hot
disks or massive halos Ostriker and Peebles 1973 Einasto et al 1974 But in the seventies
no data could indicate that the inner parts of the galactic disks were hot enough Discs
were considered as consisting of cold populations by extrapolation of the solar neighborhood
data Now more recent observations indicate that the velocity dispersions in inner parts
of typical Sbc galaxies can be of the order of 100 kms1 eg Lewis et Freeman 1989
Bottema 1993 showing that disks can be hot there
In the last decade theoretical arguments as well as new numerical experiments and
deductions from the observations of the luminosity prole of disks have contributed to
modify the point of view about the role played by halos on global stability The stabilization
of disks against non-axisymmetric perturbations if ensured by halos should only depend
on the halo mass located in the inner region of the disc where a bar usually develops it
should not depend on the halo mass in the outer regions where the rotation curve remains
at Kalnajs 1987 disturbed minds by claiming 1 that the luminous  rotation curves
calculated from the observed exponential stellar disk luminosity proles would t very well
the observed rotation curves in the optical region of galaxies and 2 that as a consequence
dark halos would be useless to stabilize against a bar
Today the global stability in the disks against bar-like perturbations is no longer the
acute problem that it used to be in the seventies As mentioned in section 2 at least two
thirds of observed spirals are recognized to be barred or to present an oval structure in
the inner regions de Vaucouleurs 1963 The remaining third includes edge-on and dusty
galaxies in which a bar can hardly be detected In many cases IR photometry less aected
by dust reveals barred structures invisible in the B band Further on extensive numerical
simulations by Athanassoula and Sellwood 1986 have shown that the growth of a bar
may be prevented if the central part of the disk is hot enough Q  25 at all radii seems
to be a sucient criterion for global stability against non-axisymmetric perturbations in
all disks However this result concerns pure stellar disks
Coming back to the kinematic observations we point out that spiral HI rotation curves
which extend typically up to 2 - 3 R25 are well known to stay in general suciently at
over this range for requiring an important presence of mass in the outer parts of spirals
Some authors tried to solve the question of the contribution of various components disc
bulge halo to the observed rotation curves produced by HI data see eg Sancisi and van
Albada 1987 Among the proposed solutions the maximum disc solution consists in
maximizing the contribution of the luminous matter to the observed rotation curve This
yields to a conservative lower limit for the amount of dark matter and an estimate of the
ML ratio for the disk The maximum disk solution received recently a strong support
from an extensive work on kinematical data of  500 galaxies it reproduces well the ne
wiggles of the light conrming that the fraction of dark halo within the stellar optical
parts of the galaxies must not be important Freeman 1993 Athanassoula et al 1987
have had recourse to the swing amplication theory to better constrain the contribution
of the halo and the disk to the rotation curve Considering that a lot of galaxies display a
2-arm spiral structure they were able to estimate the disk mass required to kill the mode
1 and to preserve the mode 2 This interesting approach is worth to be pursued based on
more extensive data
From the present discussion we can conclude that the only really obvious dark matter
problem subsisting in spirals concerns the outer regions beyond the optical disk The fact
that the disk plus the bulge on one hand and the dark halo on the other hand bring an
essential and about equal contribution to the at rotation curve in two distinct regions
namely in the inner luminous region and in the outer 21 cm emitting HI region has
suggested a physical coupling between these components also called disc-halo conspiracy
Bahcall and Casertano 1985 van Albada and Sancisi 1986 No convincing explanation
of it has yet been given
Furthermore new HI observations have restricted the range of the conspiracy Casertano
and van Gorkom 1991 published HI rotation curves characterized by a large decrease
between 1 and 3 R25 and have found a clear correlation between the peak circular velocity
its central brightness and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer parts of the disks
see section 2 remark 7 This result leads these authors to suggest that the ratio of the
dark to luminous matter might be the critical parameter controlling the Hubble sequence
It is crucial to determine if really late-type galaxies contain more dark matter than early-
type ones or if the importance of dark matter decreases with luminosity These questions
introduced by Tinsley 1981 have been recently discussed again see for example Salucci
et al 1991 and references therein
A curious coincidence Bosma 1981 until now unexplained has been recently recalled
by Freeman 1993 and references therein and better documented by Broeils 1992 the
surface density ratio of dark matter and HI gas in a sample of galaxies remains constant
outside the optical disc around 10 - 30 If dark matter tends to follow HI with a constant
ratio of about 20 we have the very curious situation that dark matter is concomitant to
HI radially yet dark matter does not prevent HI to are out the plane just beyond the
optical disk The aring shows at least that dark matter cannot be much atter than HI
It can be assumed that if the dark matter is radially proportional to HI it should be
also proportional perpendicularly We quote here the arguments given by Pfenniger et al
1994 and Pfenniger and Combes 1994 to suggest that dark matter in spiral galaxies is
essentially made of cold hydrogen in a disc supported mostly by rotation
Dierent observational constraints can be advanced on the presumed form of hydrogen
A massive amount of hot or warm form of hydrogen can be ruled out essentially because
hot and warm gas already lls most of the interstellar volume at a much too low density to
contribute to the mass in an appreciable amount On the contrary although cold gas lls
a small part of the volume its density is large enough to encompass most of the ISM mass
Moreover this condensed structure explains in part the invisible character of the medium
its low cross-section for absorption studies and its transparency to external radiation
Even if the medium is essentially molecular the CO molecule can hardly serve as a tracer
because of the low metallicity of this quasi-primordial gas A fraction could also be in
atomic form but HI emission cannot be detected in a medium at 3 K Absorption studies
of the outer parts of galaxies could probe this medium Cold gas is observed to be fractal
over several decades of length and density Details are given in Pfenniger and Combes
1994 It turns out that both the problem of mass underestimate in HI disks and the
problem of star non-formation in outer disks is closely linked to the fractal structure The
physical state of this gas must be high density and cold temperature Since no signicant
heating sources in the outer disks presumably exist it can be assumed that the gas is
bathing in the cosmological background and that its temperature is about 3 K In these
nearly isothermal conditions clouds can fragment until they reach small clump units where
the cooling time becomes comparable to the free-fall time The average typical density of
these elementary clouds lets called clumpuscules is 1010 cm3  column density 1024
cm2 size 30 AU and mass 103M These small units are the building blocks of a
fractal structure that ranges upwards over 4 to 6 orders of magnitude in scales They
are gravitationally bound and the corresponding thermal width along the line of sight for
molecular hydrogen at T  3K is about 01 kms1
We will come back later section 10 to this suggestion since it could certainly have con-
sequences on the secular evolution of disks and particularly on the morphological changes
that galaxies can suer with time
If the dark matter in disk galaxies is assumed to be made of cold gas the question of
stability of such disks must be discussed In fact HI disks are far from being perfectly
axisymmetric smooth and thin large asymmetries warps spiral arms massive HI com-
plexes are observed The gas is unsteady Q could be subcritical But the classical Toomre
formula is less obvious in this context An extensive discussion in Pfenniger et al 1994
shows that the stability and self-consistency of cold gaseous disks is a less severe problem
than commonly believed
6 Interaction between components
61 Disk-halo interactions
a Adiabatic invariance of actions for spheroid stars
When the actions J Jr Lz J characterizing stellar orbits in a galactic potential are
well dened for stars on regular orbits they can be considered as adiabatic invariants
if the potential is varying slowly see section 3 Such is the case of the actions of stars
belonging to a spheroid in the frame of the scenario Fall and Efstathiou 1980 according
to which the disk gradually forms in the potential well of the spheroid Information on
the original orbits of these stars can be inferred owing to this property The distribution
function F J  is also an invariant
In axisymmetric models of our Galaxy the most important resonance in the meridian
plan R z is 11 The corresponding resonant orbits occupy a small fraction of phase
space  8 Chaotic orbits only concern stars with very small angular momentum 
200 kms1kpc Cretton and Martinet 1994 It is shown that actions could be dened
for many halo stars in the solar neighborhood even if the z-velocity is relatively large  
100 kms1
Binney and May 1986 have studied the response of a galactic spheroid to the slow
accumulation of a massive disk
It appears that models which start from a spherical
distribution cannot reproduce the presently observed solar neighborhood because the nal
state in this case would have   r or    or both which are in contradiction with the
kinematical properties of halo stars Models starting from attened initial conditions axis
ratio q0  07 can yield velocity dispersions r or  in agreement with observations
and the nal axis ratio is qF  033 The slow accretion of a disk must progressively atten
the spheroid
b Transfer of angular momentum from disk to the halo in N-body simulations
In many N-body simulations of disk galaxy evolution a current approximation is to
consider the halo as a rigid body It is necessary to know whether simulations in which
disk and halo stars are treated self-consistently give the same results Sellwood 1980 has
shown that rigid approximation is sucient for studies of global stability However it is
expected that the disk loses angular momentum to the halo In fact a signicant transfer
of angular momentum from the disk to the halo is observed only after the formation of
a strong bar which appears in fact as a tool of this transfer In this work the evolution
was followed for at most 1200 Myr and the long term consequences of the interaction were
not evaluated The problem has been recently restarted by Little and Carlberg 1991 and
Hernquist and Weinberg 1992 see the next subsections
62 Dynamical friction and bar-disk interactions
Let us consider a set of stars eld stars of individual mass m having a velocity distri-
bution F vm and a test body of mass M moving through the stellar background with
an initial velocity Vo relatively to the center of mass of the eld stars As a result M
undergoes a purely gravitational retarding force due to the density enhancement behind
it of stars deviated by its passage The net eect termed dynamical friction is a motion
deceleration of M which has been evaluated fty years ago by Chandrasekhar 1943 for
the case of a rigid body passing through an innite homogeneous medium see also Henon
For instance if F vm is Maxwellian the deceleration is
4lnG2M  m
erfX 
eX 2 V M
M and only stars with velocity vm  VM contribute to it
where X  vm2 ln is the Coulomb logarithm with   bmaxbmin  ratio of the maxi-
mum to the minimum impact parameter  is the eld stellar density So the deceleration
is proportional to M  V 2
Dynamical friction is potentially important in various problems of galactic dynamics
the motion of globular clusters or dwarf galaxies around parent galaxies the motion of bars
within galactic disks or the interaction of disk galaxies A number of questions arise about
the application of the Chandrasekhar formula in such contexts Is the self-gravity of the
eld population negligible Is the local treatment adequate What about the hypothesis of
rigidity Is the dynamical friction dominant with regard to resonance eects occurring in
disk galaxy interactions Furthermore we must recall shortcomings such as the arbitrary
choice of bmax or the use of keplerian hyperbolae for orbits in 2-body encounters on which
the calculation of dynamical friction is based Especially a controversy recently arised
concerning the importance of the self-gravity in dynamical friction see for instance Combes
1992 and references therein In our context of interactions between components of disk
galaxies we will here be concerned by the self-gravity problem in the frame of the bar-disk
angular momentum exchange We will come back in section 8 on the dynamical friction in
galaxy-galaxy interactions
A 2-D analytic calculation of the friction between a bar and a disk has been made in
the angle-action formalism by Little and Carlberg 1991 in the absence of self gravity
The chosen unperturbed potential 0 is that of a Kuzmin-Toomre disc

In view of comparing the analytic treatment with Nbody simulations it is necessary
to average 1J2 and 2J2 over w1 w2 for many stars The contributions to the leading
term h2J2i can be calculated in the epicyclic approximation h1J2i  0 They are
essentially resonant l  0 for the corotation l  1 for the ILR and OLR Their sum
approximately gives the true phase average angular momentum change per star by unit
mass It is proportional to Qbar2
Little and Carlberg undertaken numerical simulations of the bar-disc system described
above to evaluate the role of the self-gravity which is parameterized by sg  MdiscMtot
0  sg  1 The axisymmetric galaxy model consists of a N-body disk and a rigid halo
An artice permits to vary the relative masses of the disk and halo without changing the
overall potential set equivalent to Kuzmin disk in the plane with the object of comparing
with the theoretical results As an example g 10 shows the angular momentum change
hJi for a case of suciently weak bar having a high pattern speed sg  0 The
agreement between theoretical prediction and numerical simulation is very good The
angular momentum exchange occurs at the corotation r0  23 and at the OLR r0  32
In another example low pattern speed of the bar an absorption of angular momentum
near the corotation located just beyond the edge of the disk is observed as well as an
emission near the outer ILR These behaviors are consistent with the detailed and very
clear discussion by Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972
As for the self-gravity eect studied by varying sg in the simulation it appears that
it tends to increase the absolute angular momentum transfer for high b and inversely to
decrease it for low b In fact the present situation is quite similar to the familiar problem
of an harmonic oscillator driven at steady frequency 2  b lower or higher than its
natural frequency  as underlined by Little and Carlberg As the case may be this
oscillator responds in phase or in antiphase with the imposed perturbation Self-gravity
amplies the process signicantly but by less than 60
The authors mention that the present results on the role of the self-gravity cannot be
compared with others connected with the decay of a satellite around a parent galaxy for
which case the physics is very dierent Therefore it is not surprising that the respective
conclusions be dierent
63 Bar-spheroid interactions
Bars also can interact with spheroidal components of galaxies such as bulges luminous or
dark halos By using the angle-action formalism introduced in section 3 and by restricting
oneself to a linear approximation of the perturbation theory it is possible to estimate
the torque exerted by a bar on a spheroid The usual starting point is the collisionless
Boltzmann equation formally written

Hernquist and Weinberg 1992 in the context of the interaction between a rigid bar with
an initially non-rotating spheroid
It shows that large variations of density occur when
n    0 that is to say at and near to resonances In the limited frame of the non-self-
gravitating problem and if the bar rotation axis is parallel to the z-axis of the spheroid
Weinberg 1985 had calculated that the torque exerted by the bar given by the time
derivative of the angular momentum Jz depends on the square of the perturbed amplitude

Numerical simulations allow to study more thoroughly the eects of the interaction in

A general result is that most of angular momentum exchange is resonant conrming
the prediction of the linear theory The quantity of angular momentum J transferred
to the spheroid depends on the presence of low order resonances which are the most im-
portant and on the location and the number of resonances In a typical simulation with
MbMs  3 inside corotation and a bar rotation period of 108 years the bar loses its
angular momentum in less than 109 years Furthermore a change of structure is observed
in the spheroid the density near the center decreases with time the density in the outer
parts increases with time The spheroid becomes rotationally attened A pic value of
the ratio of the systematic to the random velocity in the azimuthal direction is 02 - 025
which corresponds for an oblate spheroid to an ellipticity  09 The physical process
which triggers the angular momentum transfer is qualitatively well described by using the
quadrupole component of the bar potential only
It seems that we have here a new indication that bars are responsible of secular dynam-
ical evolution in galaxies However in the mentioned experiments the spheroid is initially
non-rotating the bar is rigid and does not respond to the spheroid Now we know that
bars can evolve for various reasons as seen in the others subsections These limitation can
restrict the bearing of the results mentioned above at least quantitatively
64 Stellar motions perpendicular to a disk perturbed by a bar
Resonant excitations
Resonant excitation of motion perpendicular to the galactic plane z-direction can concern
stars on quasi-circular orbits in a attened slightly non-axisymmetric rotating potential
Theoretical prediction about it have been given by Binney 1981 and the results are clearly
conrmed by 3-D numerical simulations which will be described in the next subsection

Between R  0 and R  Rcorotation a increases from 2
0 2 is in principle
larger than 1 for a attened galaxy For R  Rcorotation a decreases as  R2 at large R
for a at rotation curve
Amongst the resonance conditions n  2 is the most important for direct orbits If
the potential is not strongly barred the rst term of q in the bracket is negligible and q
would be large only if   2  p or   p corresponding to the classical resonance
regions In fact only the Lindblad resonance case has to be considered because if   p
a  4 For a strongly barred potential 1 is high and q can be large Outside the outer
Lindblad resonance a may go through 1
For a retrograde orbit p  0 a decreases from  02 at R0  0 to zero at large
R Then if 0   0  p can be  1 or go through 1 Then n  1 is the most
interesting resonance in this case and large z-motions can also be developed
If numerous stars develop such z-
oscillations the potential will be modied Consequently rigorous treatment of the problem
requires to take collective eects into consideration 3-D N-body simulations such as those
reported by Combes at al 1990 conrm the importance of perpendicular resonances in
the secular evolution of barred galaxies see next subsection
In such an investigation the potential is given
3-D simulations of bar-disk interactions box and peanut-
Bars are often strong non-axisymmetric perturbations in regions of the disks where the
coupling of motions in the plane of the disk and perpendicular to it could be important
Instabilities perpendicular to the plane often called vertical instabilities must be not
neglected a priori Therefore a realistic treatment of barred galaxies needs a full 3-D
dynamics As we are going to see many vertical instability strips occur in bars even if
A detailed analysis of the 3-D problem can be found in Combes et al
they have no important thickness in the z-direction and peanut-shaped bulges are formed
in 3D N-body bars as a consequence of resonant coupling between relative plane motions
and perpendicular oscillations That conrms the predictions of the previous subsection
1990 and
Pfenniger and Friedli 1991 where the authors use the purely stellar dynamics part of
the Geneva 3-D fully consistent numerical code with gas and stars PMSPH As the aim
is to study the structure of the bar as well as the orbital behavior of stars in the perturbed
potential the initial conditions are chosen so that the disc be initially globally unstable
For a representative model characterized by bulge scale length 014 and disk scale length
3 with a mass ratio MBMD  18 a bar is formed in 3 - 4 dynamical time  3 to 4108
years The angular momentum is ejected by strong two armed spiral patterns A secular
evolution of the bar is observed in z and a box or a peanut-shaped structure is reached
after 2  109 years through a short phase of symmetry breaking in z Fig 11 The bar
is quasi stationary after 25  109 years Its pattern speed slowly decreases  p15dyn 
0035 and p50dyn  0028 in the units of the code
The surface density prole of the disk outside the bar region is exponential along the
major axis of the bar and follows a R14 law along its minor axis It results from some
relaxation process produced by the formation and the evolution of the bar The velocity
ellipsoid is characterized by R    z  1  085  075 in the bar and 1  055  045
in the disk The radial behavior of the velocity dispersions is shown in g 12 displaying
in particular a signicant vertical heating
Repeatedly the bar is a very ecient engine for transferring the angular momentum
outwards the total angular momentum inside the corotation radius decreases by more
than 50 between the initial time and 5  109 years
To the rst order N-body bars are similar to observed stellar bars The morphology and
the cylindrical rotation agree with observations by Jarvis 1990 in NGC 128 for instance
which is the prototype of peanut galaxies The actual fraction of box-peanut bulges is 
20 Taking account of the time scale for forming this structure and the selection eects
due to the diculty of their detection according to the inclination of the galaxies Combes
and al
1990 suggested that any observed box- or peanut-shaped bulge could be the
signature of a strong bar inside the galaxy
To the second order the central parts of N-body and observed bars are dierent N-
body bars show similar ellipticities in the isophotes whereas most of observed SB0s for
instance have round isophotes An explanation of the disagreement could be found in the
possibility of gas accretion towards the central parts
In fact an essential ingredient is
missing in the simulations described above the gaseous component and consequently the
star formation which imply energy and angular momentum dissipation as well as self-
regulating processes which control the balance between cooling and heating This problem
will be pointed out in sections 7 and 9
Let us come to the connection between the box- or peanut-shape and resonances It can
be understood by studying orbits in the N-body bars which have the advantage on existing
analytical models to be self-consistent to have a measurable b and to permit to follow the
time evolution The 2-D orbital structure of N-body bars has been examined by Sparke
and Sellwood 1987 For the extension to 3-D structure Pfenniger and Friedli 1991 used
the Geneva code already mentioned The position of the resonances can be estimated by
averaging on azimuthal angles the generalized frequencies dened by Pfenniger 1990

The main new result of the 3-D orbital structure is the existence of vertical bifurcations
in particular
- The direct x1 family of periodic orbits which essentially sustains the bar has a vertical
instability strip 21 resonance responsible for the box-peanut shape Examples of
periodic and quasi-periodic orbits supporting the peanut-shape are elongated orbits
along the bar with z  122 or eventually 144 Fig 13
- The usual retrograde family x4 has a vertical instability strip 11 resonance From
the boundaries of the strip anomalous inclined orbits bifurcate They were previously
mentioned section 4 as one of the important class of orbits in systems with 3 degrees
of freedom
We note that the x1 and x4 families are connected by two resonant families 31 and
7 Dissipation in disks
Until recently apart from studies of the gas response to perturbations bar-like for ex the
dynamical importance of gas on large galactic scale has not drawn the attention very much
partially because it was considered as a minor contributor to the total mass of galaxies
However because of its dissipative nature its behavior is fundamentally dierent from
the stellar one In the disk evolution the role of this tracer of spiral patterns as coupling
element with stars and as fuel for nuclear activity is essential
In the present section we begin with a description of various methods used to introduce
dissipation in evolution calculations Then we will examine some of the key numerical
experiments which allow to understand a the spiral structure evolution and the various
Hubble types of spirals b the eect of gas adjunction on the disk stability against the bar
formation c the gas inow towards the central region of galaxies and its consequences
Recent 3-D fully consistent simulations represent decisive progress about these questions
One of the key physical processes in disk evolution is the angular momentum redistribu-
tion between the components see also section 6 Probably the most eective mechanisms
responsible of the loss of angular momentum by the gas are a the collisional viscosity
due to highly dissipative cloud-cloud collisions and supersonic velocity b the dynamical
friction on massive clouds produced by the background stars c the gravitational torques
exerted by non-axisymmetric perturbations in the stellar component bars or spiral arms
on the gas Shlosman and Noguchi 1994 recently have evaluated the relative importance
of these mechanisms and concluded that the dynamical friction can cause a rapid inow of
gas if much of it is in massive clumps The eciency of the bar driven inow depends on
the bar strength and on the gas mass whereas the collisional viscosity seems to be unim-
portant in general The development of bar-like structures and their interaction with the
gas has been extensively studied by several groups in recent years and we will report on
some of works in this section
71 Modelisation of the gas behavior
Until now essentially two dierent types of approaches have been proposed to follow the
gas behavior in numerical simulations of disc galaxies in evolution
1 Ballistic particles
Cold dense clouds have been considered as ballistic particles with a nite cross section
Schwarz 1981 and 1984 The basic principle is to take a rectangular grid with specied
box size overlaid on the disk Two gas particles clouds collide if they are in the same box
and have a component of relative velocity towards each other The collision reverses the
relative velocities of the gas particles and reduces them by some restitution coecient
Typically the size of the box is of the order of 05 of the disk radius The particle
graininess is a non negligible source of small amplitude initial perturbation cold disk
are strong ampliers of small disturbances But in a real galaxy a signicant fraction of
gas is considered into a large number of molecular clouds which display a similar level of
graininess Therefore this approach has been often considered as suciently realistic in
spite of the rather ad hoc estimation of energy dissipation in clouds
It has been used
for instance by Carlberg and Freedman 1985 Combes and Elmegreen 1993 amongst
others
2 Smooth particle hydrodynamics
A collection of clouds is considered as a uid with a sound speed of the order of the
velocity dispersion of the clouds typically 5 - 10 kms1 At present time for simulations
of long-time evolution the smooth particle hydrodynamics SPH method is often used
a set of smoothed-out quasi-particles is considered so that the uid density at any point
is obtained by summation on all particles at that point SPH is based on the Lagrangian
description For a detailed review on this technique see for ex Monaghan 1992 and
Benz 1990 Here a stumbling-block is the perhaps excessive shear viscosity derived from
an articial viscosity term introduced in the hydrodynamical equations to simulate the
dissipation in shocks Various solutions have been proposed to try to control this eect
Friedli and Benz 1993 by reducing the articial viscosity in largely shear ows and
leaving it unchanged in strong shocks
72 Spiral activity in disks
A rst example will be given here to underline the importance of gas relatively to the large
frequency of observed spiral structures A purely stellar disk displays a strong spiral activity
which quickly raises the velocity dispersion of stars and the disk becomes less responsive to
further disturbances It is a general result of purely N-body simulations Dissipation and
or accretion can act as gas cooling factors That could be a way to maintain some fraction
of the disk mass at a low velocity dispersion resulting in a quasi-permanent sensitivity to
the growth of spiral disturbances
This process has been investigated by Carlberg and Freedman 1985 by adding the
Schwarz dissipative collision scheme to the Sellwood N-body disk  halo code Sellwood
1981 N  40000 and a 31 stellar to gas mass ratio were adopted The initial values of
Qstar and Qgas were respectively 133 and 0
After 5 revolutions   109 years it clearly appears that the spiral structure is much
more prominent in the gas than in the star component because of the low velocity dispersion
of the gas The morphology depends on the relative mass of the disk in the sense that
the number of arms is a strong function of the disc-halo mass ratio as expected from the
swing amplication theory Toomre 1981 For a shearing disc the critical wavelength c
for long wave instabilities is
42GR
Let us assume the rotation velocity V0  cte then  
2GR where f is
the mass fraction in the disk The number of arms m in the spiral pattern is connected to
the azimuthal wavelength  by
R  R  f V 2
 
The peak amplication corresponds to   2c Toomre 1981
From these relations it comes
In a pure stellar disc the trailing spirals transfer angular momentum outwards ac-
cording to Lynden-Bell and Kalnajs 1972
In the simulations here described the gas
systematically loses angular momentum to the stars and a radial inow is settling with
a time scale of the order of an Hubble time We will nd back later this key problem of
angular momentum transfer in experiments dealing with bars
73 Bar-disk evolution in early and late-type spirals
In the past N-body simulations have been essentially devoted to studies of disk stability
and growth of modes without consideration for the observed distinct morphology of Sa to
Sd galaxies However one of the aims of galactic studies is to explain the dierent Hubble
types and eventually the evolution from one type to another For example dierences be-
tween early and late-type barred spirals such as emphasized by Elmegreen and Elmegreen
1985 1989 will have to be taken into account Some properties of bars in these dierent
types are summarized in the table 2 These are general tendencies that nevertheless admit
exceptions

In order to understand the origin of the dierences mentioned in the table Combes
and Elmegreen 1993 studied by numerical simulations the formation and the evolution of
bars in N-body systems having characteristics of early and late-type galaxies essentially
large and small bulges respectively They also examined the gas behavior The stars are
initially in a Toomre disk Q  const and the gas distributed in an exponential disk
The bulge-spheroid component is a Plummer sphere The mass ratio MBMD  2 for
early-type system and 110 to 15 in late-type ones The main evolution phases observed
in the case of purely stellar system are the following
For late-type systems at the beginning development of a small-amplitude m 2 wave
with p    
2 which transfers angular momentum from the stars in the inner disk to
the stars in the outer disk then growth of a bar from the center which traps particles
stars at larger and larger radii After  109 years the bar ceases from growing because
corotation overtakes regions with not enough particles to receive angular momentum The
length of the bar is constrained by the scale length of the disk The value of p  10
kms1kpc1 is of the order of   
2  In this case the bar seems to end inside corotation
This limitation comes from the fact that the bar is unable to transfer angular momentum
in low density region
For early-type systems we expect that the disk is more stable The evolution begins
similarly to the late-type case but p is initially much larger   
2 is larger for galaxies
with a large bulge The corotation radius is suciently short so that angular momentum
from the inner disk nds a reservoir for transfer up to corotation during the slow growth
in length and strength of the bar for over a Hubble time An other dierence obtained
between late and early type systems is the density distribution in the bars the density
proles are exponential but for early types they are atter near the center
The gas is expected to be important in the evolution of spiral waves and bars it dissi-
pates the wave energy and amplies the spirals through gaseous self-gravity Particularly
in late-type galaxies the mass as well as the angular momentum fraction of gas is rel-
atively high This gas is a reservoir for the angular momentum transferred out by the
wave Combes and Elmegreen 1993 suggest that this angular momentum absorption is
responsible for a prolonged bar evolution by comparison with the case of a purely stellar
disk The growth phase for the bar is also larger
The main result concerning the late-type simulation is the appearance of a very thin
bar in the gas with the same length as the fat stellar bar More structure is present in
the gas than in the stars with transient waves The gas is strongly driven inwards by the
gravitational torque from the bar The end of the bar coincides with one disk exponential
scale length Fig 14 In the case of early-type simulation the stellar bar extends nearly
up to corotation and a thin bar develops in the gas as well as a nuclear ring at the ILR
An important dierence between simulations with and without gas appears in the time
scale for the setting-up of the bar 2  108 years for a late-type galaxy and 5  108 years for
an early type one That is much faster than for purely stellar cases which can be stable
with Q  15 for a Hubble time This result is in agreement with predictions by Jog and
Solomon 1984 mentioned in sect 5 according to which a gas-star system can be unstable
even if one of both components is stable by itself The fact that the dissipation maintains
Q  1 for the gas explains the evolution described above
74 Bar driven gas fueling of galactic nuclei
As indicated in 71 another eective method to describe the behavior of gas in galaxies is
based via the classical hydrodynamic equations on smooth particle hydrodynamics SPH
codes Such a code has been used by Friedli and Benz 1993 see also Friedli et al 1991
These authors investigated the ability of bars to transport gas towards the central parts of
galaxies In particular they looked for what parameters at work are the most important
in this context A fully consistent 3-D simulation of starsgas systems consists in 3 main
1 Given the mass distribution for gas and stars to compute the gravitational potential
 by using the part of the code consisting in a particle-mesh PM algorithm in
Fourier space on a polar grid This fast method allows to include a large number of
particles 1 to 5  105 a fraction of them being gaseous  10
2 Using the SPH approach to compute the hydrodynamical forces acting on the gaseous
component only At the present time the modelisation of this component does neither
take account of the variety of the interstellar matter composition diuse atomic
warm and cloudy molecular cold components nor of its fractal structure It would
be illusory to introduce complexity at this level as far as the permitted numerical
resolution prevents to describe the ISM in ne details
3 To move all the particles by using for instance a second order Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg
integrator
The main results from this fully 3-D self-consistent evolution conrm the fact previously
suggested by Shlosman et al 1989 that a bar acting on the gaseous component of an
isolated galaxy allows a transport of mass up to several 109M towards the center with a
mean rate of some Myr1 but reaching roughly 200 Myr1 in extreme situations On
average more than 1 of the total mass of the galaxy in the form of gas could be brought
near the nucleus The mass accretion is increased 1 if the bulgedisk mass ratio is lowered
and 2 if the axis ratio of the stellar bar ab is larger The accretion is smaller by a factor 4
for gas in retrograde motion compared with direct motion Finally the gas self-gravitation
reinforces the accretion only when the gas density becomes high enough
Dierent experiments by Friedli and Benz 1993 lead to the conclusion that the gaseous
bars are always induced by barred stellar potentials No gaseous bar is formed sponta-
neously in models with xed axisymmetric stellar potential Moreover the gaseous bars
are always shorter than their stellar counterparts and their axis ratio ba is smaller by a
factor 2 - 3 Fig 15 indicates the time evolution of the central mass concentration inside
the radius RL  02 05 and 1 kpc for the gas and the stars for one of their models
The mass accreted can represent a small but non-negligible part of the galactic mass 1
- 2 Consequently a strong ILR can settle which causes the main elongated plane orbits
which support the bar to be replaced by orbits perpendicular to the bar which is no longer
sustained In a few Gyr the initial bar can be transformed into a triaxial bulge such as
observed in many spirals These bulges could be the relics of old bars see also section 8
The dynamical eects of star formation are not included in this scenario It is a new
scaling in complexity At present time star formation cannot be rigorously modeled as
an additional equation in the present context We will come back in section 9 on recipes
which allow to mimic this part of the global evolution scenario
75 Bars within bars and their eects
The reality of the peculiar phenomenon of bars within bars has emerged from the following
three complementary approaches
1 Secondary nuclear bars or triaxial bulges have been observed in visible light by
dierent authors in several barred spiral or lenticular galaxies for example NGC 1291 de
Vaucouleurs 1974 or NGC 3945 Kormendy 1979 1981 1982 in addition recent CO
observations have also revealed central molecular bars or rings not aligned with the stellar
bars Kenney 1991 Devereux et al 1992 see also Lo et al 1984 Galaxies with a nuclear
ring eventually crossed by a secondary bar were studied by Buta 1990 The prototype
could be NGC 3081
2 Theoreticians have proposed bars within bars as a possible mechanism of gas fueling
in active galactic nuclei Shlosman et al 1989 1990 The possible existence of self-
consistent models of periodically time-dependent stellar systems has been conrmed by
Louis and Gerhard 1988 and Sridhar 1989
3 Self-consistent 3D N-body simulations with gas and stars Friedli 1992 can lead to
the formation of systems with two bars rotating with two dierent pattern speeds provided
that the initial gas mass amounts to about 10 of the total mass Friedli and Martinet
1993 This emphasizes the key role of dissipation The secondary bar results from a de-
coupling between the nearly self-gravitating central part and the outer part of the primary
bar The decoupling seems to be sensitive to mass accumulation onto the x2 orbit families
of the primary bar resulting from the presence of a moderate ILR Either the primary bar
rst appears followed by the secondary one or the two bars almost simultaneously develop
In the latter case a nuclear gaseous ring is in general formed near the secondary bar end
The best model has shown that these double-barred systems are stable over more than
5 turns of the secondary bar It has the following characteristics   sp  790255
kms1kpc1  31   lpls  9525 kpc  38 and the axis-ratios are as  06 and
ap  07 Fig 16
Bar-driven gas fueling can be signicant and can compress gas inside the bar to about
10 - 20 of the bar length The system of nested bars thus transports amounts of gas much
closer to the galactic center and could be invoked as a possible mechanism to fuel AGN
The gas accretion rate can be very high and could be related to some starburst mechanism
However the eciency of star formation must be explored before denite conclusions can
be drawn
The two bar phase is followed by the dissolution of the secondary bar or even the
two bars depending on the model which is induced by a broad and strong ILR The nal
central galaxy shape resulting from the two bar destruction is similar to triaxial observed
bulges suggesting that some of them are relics of destroyed bars
The above scenario is dierent from that proposed by Shaw and al
1993 Both
scenarios need the presence of a massive and strongly dissipative component but in the one
described above it is supposed to initiate the central dynamical decoupling while in Shaw
et al it is only supposed to gravitationally deform the stellar component As a major
consequence in our scenario the two stellar bars have dierent pattern speeds whereas
in theirs they have the same Since theoretical numerical as well as observational studies
seem to indicate that single and multiple pattern speeds can occur in galaxy dynamics it is
dicult to dismiss either of these scenarios and consequently to determine if only one and
which one or both are in action in real double-barred galaxies However the existence
of secondary trailing stellar bars seems dicult to explain with Shaw and als scenario A
mixing up can also eventually follow from the existence of both central twisted isophotes
resulting either from projection eects onto triaxial bodies or from torques initiated by
strong spiral arms and two distinct bars Shaw et als scenario may eventually better
correspond to the case of twists than the one of two distinct and persisting bars Clearly
more studies are necessary to assess the respective merit of these two scenarios as well as
to determine the essential parameters which initiate the models to be channeled or not
into the way of the multiple pattern speeds
8 Environment eects Accretion of satellite
galaxies
The present review essentially turns on the internal dynamical evolution of galaxies The
previous section displayed important eects able to produce morphological modications
of galaxy structure only due to interactions between components of the system considered
including the gas In the discussion of the processes at work it was implicitly admitted
that the systems were isolated However at present time nobody contests that most
galaxies must suer more or less strong interactions with their neighbours during their
lifetimes The proceedings edited by Wielen 1990 reviewed various problems concerning
these phenomena Visible eects of interactions such as bridges tails warps shells ripples
dust rings multiple nuclei more or less advanced stages of merging are the subject of
continuous attention The interest for these questions is strengthened by recent qualitative
evidences of a connection between interactions and bursts of star formation see section
In our own context we will be here interested in the morphology transformations of
disks and bulges resulting from accretion of small satellite galaxies Beforehand we will
briey mention the case of strong destroying collisions between two similar disk galaxies
the result of which could account for starbursts which will be discussed in section 9
81 An example of strong interaction between galaxies
Strong interactions can be dened as those in which galaxy number is not conserved
They have been recently discussed especially by Barnes and Hernquist 1991 1992 and
Barnes 1992 In particular these authors presented a simulation of merger of two self-
consistent bulgediskhalo galaxies of equal mass including 10 of gas The mass ratio
of the components is 1316 in both galaxies Two fundamental questions about such
simulated parabolic collision are 1 What is the morphology of the remnant 2 What is
the fate of gas
Using a SPH algorithm to describe the gas behavior Barnes and Hernquist 1991
concluded the following
- Mergers such as considered in the frame of the chosen peculiar initial conditions pro-
duce a triaxial slowly rotating remnant with a r14 luminosity prole
- The interaction transfers a large fraction of the energy of the relative motion to the
internal degrees of freedom The passage leads to a more tightly bound orbit then
to a complete merger in  750 millions years
- Gas and disk stars have a similar behavior on large scale but not on small scale
the strong tidal eld triggers a strong stellar bar The gas response is similar but
dissipative shocks appear The gaseous bar is narrower and shorter
- Half the gas initially in the disk is transferred toward the center of the merger by
purely gravitational torque 5  109M within  200 pcs
- Strong shocks and radiative cooling are a necessary condition for such a process
We refer the reader to the review mentioned above for the details An analogous
mechanism has been described in section 7 in connection with the bar-driven gas fueling
of nucleus in an isolated galaxy In both cases the nal evolution is uncertain due to the
fact that star formation and supernova heating have been ignored in the experiments
Let us add that some peculiar initial conditions in other simulations Pfenniger 1994
are able to produce counter-rotating disks similar to that observed in NGC 4550 for ex
Rix et al 1992
82 Coming back to dynamical friction
Dynamical friction mechanism has been described in section 6 Orbits of satellites around
massives galaxies decay due to such an eect so that galaxies could have accreted some mass
in the form of dwarf galaxies or globular clusters over a Hubble time Even if the implied
mass quantities are not so important as in collisions between giant galaxies the resulting
deformation of the target can be not negligible as we will see in the next subsection
Three fundamental physical aspects of the problem must be mentioned to recall that
the well known simplifying Chandrasekhar formula cannot claim to give a quantitatively
correct estimate of the deceleration due to dynamical friction in the present context
1 The self-gravity of the target
2 The global nature of the target tidal deformations
3 The non-rigidity of the satellite
Combes 1992 draws attention to the dissociation of two eects connected with the
self-gravity the barycenter displacement of the target galaxy and its true deformation
Conicting results as regards to the role of the self-gravity in the satellite braking come
from the dierent way of calculating or interpreting it If the true deformation which is
the only deceleration factor is computed in the center of mass frame it appears that the
self-gravity is negligible for a satellite-target mass ratio  01 Prugniel and Combes 1992
If the target is xed in an inertial frame Weinberg 1989 taking the center of mass shift
as a self-gravity factor it is found that self-gravity slowers the decay The Chandrasekhar
formula is also based on a xed target and also overestimates the friction its local nature
is unrealistic in the present context since the tidal deformation of the target which induces
the dynamical friction may be considered as global
Moreover the tidal deformation of the satellite which is able to take away some orbital
energy and angular momentum of the relative motion must not be neglected the decay
time scale is appreciably reduced with respect to the case of a rigid satellite as seen in
Prugniel and Combes 1992
These considerations have been inferred from experiments on an elliptical galaxy and
its companion Combes 1992 also mentioned a possible complication with spiral galaxies
coming from resonance eects which could remove the satellite instead of braking it In fact
simulations show that the friction remains dominant in this case but self-gravity typically
reduces the decay time by a factor of two
83 Heating of the disks by satellite mergers An explanation for
thick disk
This mechanism has already been mentioned in section 5 amongst those able to heat the
disk in our Galaxy Certainly it is quite general and we have discussed it in more details by
basing ourselves on the deepest treatment of the problem nowadays Quinn et al 1993
in spite of some limitation given below
The used N-body models consists of self-consistent bulge-less exponential disks having
constant vertical scale length hz
These disks are imbedded in rigid modied isothermal halos the density of which is
The density distribution in satellite galaxies is given by the spherical Jae models

with the mass ratio MsatMdisk  4 to 20
The satellites are initially placed on circular prograde orbits at a radius 6hR hR 
exponential disk length scale with various inclinations relative to the disk plane Friction
due to the halo is ignored
The main limitations of such experiments which could lessen the bearing of the results
are the following 1 the rigidity of the halo does not allow to give quantitatively reliable
sinking rates 2 only prograde encounters are considered 3 the gas eects are not included
4 only 32768 particles in the disk and 4096 in the satellite are used
The dierent mergers obtained are characterized by various common eects
- The dynamical coupling between disks and satellites leads to satellite orbital decay
at rst by sinking into the plane of the disk then radially into the center
- A strong two-armed spiral pattern is generally induced in the disk which transports
angular momentum outwards
- The disk radially spreads and perpendicularly inates
- As the satellite sinks into the central region of the galaxy the disk is able to nd
back a new axisymmetric equilibrium
- The disk is thickened warped and ared by the merger The quantitative eect de-
pends on the initial conditions in particular the mass ratio and the initial inclination
of the satellite orbit Typically for a mass ratio of 110 and an inclination of 30 the
vertical scale height hz inside hR  35 kpc has increased by 50
- Moreover the mergers perturb the velocity distribution of stars in the disks due to
three eects a the deposit of kinetic energy and angular momentum from satellites
b the action of spiral pattern and c the accretion of satellite debris
In the typical case mentioned above the ratio of azimuthal to radial velocity dispersion
R varies from 1 in the center to 07 between 10 and 20 kpc zR varies from 075 in
the center to values larger than 1 for R  15 kpc The initial range of Q is 1  Q  2 for
0  R  15 kpc which allows a response to the mode m  2 spiral arms At the end of
the simulation T  54  109 years QR  2h  15 and Q2h  R  4h  2-4 which
is able to stabilize the disk against the mode m  2
The recurrence of mergers shows less spectacular eects the disk is hotter and more
diuse than the original thin disk The evolution of the satellite when it is represented
by a realistic self-consistent N-body model is characterized by a stripping due to the tidal
eld and an impulsive heating
There is competition between internal heating of the satellite and external heating of the
disk It appears that if the satellite is denser than the disk the disk is heated impulsively
whereas if the satellite is less dense it is heated by the disk Of course the stripping of a
self-consistent satellite and the disk tidal eld control the eciency of the disk heating by
the satellite Typically in the model considered as standard by Quinn and al mass ratio
 110 30 inclination a signicant z-heating is obtained with 60 of the satellite kinetic
energy transferred into z motions of disk stars
On the other hand in the same experiment the kinetic energy of the disk increases
by 30 - 40 of the satellite orbital energy through the spiral response of the disk to the
satellite perturbation
The are in the disk is formed by satellite debris and stars from the disk It seems to be
due to the fact that the velocity impulse is especially in the vertical direction at large radii
resulting there in a more ecient absorbtion of vertical kinetic energy than of azimuthal
kinetic energy by the disk
In brief a thin disk having suered satellite impacts must present the observed fea-
tures already mentioned radial spreading thickening vertical aring and warping Many
galaxies display these features See for instances Shaw and Gilmore 1989 for thickening
Bosma and Freeman 1991 for aring Sanchez-Saavedra and al 1990 for warping
Although the nal structures obtained by the mechanism here described are similar to
those observed in numerous galaxies we must remember that other mechanisms of disk
heating could be ecient in particular the bars The relative quantitative contribution of
all mechanisms put forward here and in section 6 to the evolution towards the observed
structures of disk is dicult to estimate the simulations which reveal the dynamical pro-
cesses at work suer from limitations mentioned repeatedly and suciently detailed obser-
vations of external galaxies concerning particularly kinematics and multi-band photometry
are still lacking
It is interesting to note that the accretion of satellites by spiral galaxies is a process
similar to that suggested by Searle and Zinn 1978 for the halo formation from subsystems
such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies
84 Bars induced by companion passages and dissolved
by satellite mergers
a Inuence of interaction on stellar bar evolution
In section 5 the conditions of disk instabilities to bar formation were examined in the
case of isolated galaxies Since the seminal paper by Toomre and Toomre 1972 there
are numerous evidences that tidal interactions can have an eect on the developments of
substructures inside the galaxies Therefore it is important to bring out the dominating
features in the interplay of bar formation and interactions To date the most complete
study was undertaken by Gerin and al 1990 who simulated close 2-D and 3-D encounters
between a disk galaxy formed of a Toomre disk and a rigid Plummer halo and a perturber
Plummer sphere on direct or retrograde orbit in the sense of the galaxy rotation or in the
opposite sense Various perturbing masses pericenter distance and mass distribution of
the galaxy were tried as determinant parameters Two dierent situations were considered
a the target galaxy is initially axisymmetric and b it is initially already strongly barred
Amongst the results we point out the following facts
1 A direct tidal interaction destabilizes a disk which otherwise does not develop a
bar for more than 1 Gyr An interaction reduces the time scale of bar formation
Retrograde encounters are not so eective The process obviously depends on the
mass ratio MhaloMdisk
2 In the perturbed case compared to the isolated case the interaction triggers a spiral
wave in the outer parts of the disk which propagates towards the central regions
strengthening the bar formation
3 In the case of an already initially barred galaxy the phase of the perturber acts
on the strength and the pattern speed of the bar practically without change of the
axisymmetric part of the galaxy potential Consequently an interaction may shift
the Lindblad Resonances in a stellar disk
4 Bending and fattening of the disk are essentially produced by interactions with a
companion perpendicular to the plane of the galaxy The increase of the bar strength
is less pronounced than in the other geometries due to the shorter time during which
the axisymmetric perturbing force acts
b Destruction of bars by satellite mergers
The inuence of the mass concentration growth on the dynamics of disks in isolated
galaxies has been discussed in section 4 eect of a blackhole on orbits plunging towards
the center and in section 7 gas inow towards central regions induced by a bar
both cases mentioned the process implies the creation of an ILR and the enlargement of
the inuence zone of the resonance with the growth of the compact mass The response
of stellar orbits in the plane is perpendicular to the bar Consequently the bar shape is
no longer supported Starting from the N-body simulation of a robust bar Friedli and
Pfenniger 1991 and Friedli 1994 conrmed the eect mentioned Articially increasing
slowly the central mass of the disk they observed that the addition of 1-2 of the total
mass in the region inside the ILR is enough to destroy the strong bar
But a bar can also be dissolved after being induced as a consequence of an environment
eect in the form of satellite merger The experiment described below is complementary
to the Quinn et al 1993 study presented in the previous subsection which did not imply
a bar evolution
Pfenniger 1991a showed the dynamical evolution of a disk perturbed by a compact
satellite initially on an inclined nearly circular direct orbit with a mass equal to 10 of
the system total mass Induced by the tidal action of the perturber a bar is formed in
100 Myr and produces spiral arms and disk heating Simultaneously the satellite spirals
by resonance and dynamical friction coupling eect It reaches the bar Lagrangian points
respectively at T  1200 Myr then at T  1300 Myr Afterwards it plunges toward
the center in 50 Myr and the bar is destroyed according to the process above mentioned
see g 1 in Pfenniger 1991a The nal structure is a small spheroidal bulge During
the spiraling of the satellite towards the center there is transfer of its orbital angular
momentum to the disk which gets warped
Inasmuch as the bar formation is easy and their observed frequency is high it is not
impossible that the barred state be a compelled step in the galaxy life There is apparently
no problem to explain that 13 of disks are unbarred since ecient mechanisms seem to
exist to destroy the bars
85 Bulge growth induced by satellite
The bulge-to-disk ratio is a qualitative as well as a quantitative classication criterion of
galaxies along the Hubble sequence cf Simien and de Vaucouleurs 1985 In spite of a
large dispersion in the relation between this ratio and the Hubble type early-type galaxies
generally have the largest bulges Bulge-less galaxies are also observed Is this diversity a
signature of initial conditions or the clue of secular evolution The simulations presented
elsewhere in this review 65 84 supply evidences in favor of the latter possibility Small
bulges could result from disk material accretion through the bar dissolution process There
we present an additional argument for secular evolution which concerns the galaxies with
big bulges the well known prototype of which is the Sombrero galaxy
A possible explanation for the existence of these bulges has been recently proposed by
Pfenniger 1993 Considering a model which consists in an initial disk with a scale length
hR  4 kpc and a scale height hz  1kpc as already described in 65 The disk was initially
slightly unstable to bar formation and a peanut-shaped bulge-bar structure was formed A
3-D simulation has been started in which ten point mass satellites initially at the outskirts
of the galaxy are slowly accreted by dynamical friction When the ratio of satellite mass
to galaxy mass MsMG is of the order of 4 the satellites modify the structure of the
bar which becomes more oval If this ratio is increased to 10 the bar is destroyed and
the disk is so much inated by heating that the remaining structure is dominated by a big
bulge where all mass comes from the disk If MsMG  10 the disk is destroyed the
remnant is a purely spheroidal system
We must note that these simulations as well as those of the previous subsection suppose
that the satellites are rigid point masses It has been mentioned in 83 that there could
exist a competition between internal heating of the satellites and external heating of the
disk when the satellites are presented by realistic self-consisting models Therefore the
mechanisms described above and in 84 can be really eective only if the satellites are
denser than the disk
9 Coupling of dynamics and star formation
As seen in section 7 eective numerical codes now exist which allow to follow the dynamical
evolution of galaxies consisting of stars and gas However an essential ingredient is still
lacking star formation Theoretical as well observational primordial questions about it
are Where does it occur What is its rate What are the main parameters which govern
the star formation eciency
At present time only partial answers can be given inasmuch as the complexity and the
diversity of processes at work is high Silk 1992 draws up an impressive list of mechanisms
at work in star formation which ought to be ideally taken into account I quote  Ioniza-

fragmentation role of magnetic elds in cloud support and ambipolar diusion without
speaking of initial mass function origin
In view of the extremely complicated nature of local star formation problems global
approaches involving a not too large number of parameters must be adopted A minimum
task should be 1 to nd a collapse criterion in order to determine where the stars are
formed 2 to introduce a parameter connected with the star formation eciency and 3
to introduce other parameters which allow to take account of thermal and mechanical
energies injected in the medium through supernovae explosions and stellar winds The
present discussion will focus on some recipes recently introduced into simulations of galactic
evolution for lack of a detailed theory of star formation Simple models will allow to tackle
the problem of the gas fate in central galactic regions and the connection between galaxy
interactions and observed big starbursts for instance Proceeding step by step it will be
possible in a near future to introduce in the models more detailed physics specifying the
conditions transforming gas into stars inside molecular clouds
91 Observational tracers of star formation
The observational tracers generally used to infer star formation rates SFR are H far-UV
and far-IR uxes The calculation of SFR results from the luminosity Li in the band i by
Li  SF RZ timLmmdmZ mmdm
where Lm is the luminosity of a star of mass m m is the initial mass function IMF
in the range of mass 01 - 100 M and tim is the characteristic time scale over which a
star of mass m emits radiation in the band i
The main source of systematic errors in the interpretation of the H emission is extinc-
tion Kennicutt 1989 Typical extinctions of HII regions in galaxies are of the order of
05 to 2 magnitudes In so far as corrections for this eect can be applied the uxes can
be converted to current star formation rates Uncertainties on the Initial Mass Function
are another origin of errors According to Kennicutt 1983
SF RH  10M  142  1042LHM yr1
SF RHtotal  89  1042LHM yr1
where LH is the H luminosity obtained from the H ux F H erg cm2s1 by
LH  3  1016F HD2L
D being the galaxy distance in unit of Mpc The total SFR is a strong function of Hubble
type as mentioned in section 2
Integrated over all stellar masses it was estimated by
Kennicutt 1983 and Caldwell et al 1991 from H data From 01 - 1 M yr1 in SOa
galaxies to  10 M yr1 in Sc-Irr galaxies Overall it ranges from less than 0001 M yr1
in extreme dwarf galaxies to more than 100 M yr1 in luminous starbursts
The same kind of diculty connected with the extinction is present in tentatives to
estimate SFR from UV datas Donas et al 1987 Bersier et al 1994 The current
star formation rate inferred from UV data 2000 A obtained with the SCAP balloon
experiment is
SF R  23  1040L2000M yr1
which represents a recent star formation rate on a period of time  100 Myr about 50
times longer than SFR based on H
From the appendix of Catalogued Galaxies and Quasars in the IRAS Survey 1985
the IRAS 40 - 120 m luminosities are according to Devereux and Young 1990
L40  120m  365  105258S60  S100D2L
S60 and S100 are the IRAS 60 and 100 m ux density in unit of Jy The resulting star
formation rates given by these authors are
SF RIR 10M  92  1011LIRM yr1
SF RIR 01M  63  1010LIRM yr1
However Sauvage and Thuan 1994 discuss the ambiguity of the information on star
formation inferred from far-IR measurements in particular through the 4 IRAS pass-bands
12 25 60 and 100m The problem rests on the fact that the far-IR emission can have a
multiple origin 1 Dust associated to molecular clouds and star-forming regions heated by
the radiation of newly formed OB stars 2 dust in the interstellar medium heated by an
interstellar radiation eld cirrus 3 photospheres or circumstellar envelopes of evolved
stars 4 dust heated by a compact source inside an active galactic nucleus The present and
past SFR the chemical composition and the size distribution with respect to the heating
sources the optical depth of the dust play a signicant role in the emission mechanisms
mentioned above
In the extensively used FIR color-color diagram logS60S100 versus logS12S25
where Si represents the ux in the 4 IRAS bands galaxies populate a relatively nar-
row sequence from the high S12S25 and low S60S100 end to the low S12S25 and high
S60S100 end Typical representatives of quiescent spiral disks and starbursts would be
respectively in the lower right end and in the upper left end of the sequence According
to Sauvage and Thuan 1994 the FIR colors of galaxies along the Hubble sequence are a
combined eect of the star formation eciency SFE and variations in dust distribution
and composition Only for Hubble types from Sbc to Sdm-Im the FIR colors seem to
be essentially controlled by an increasing SFE from quiescent to starburst objects If the
major part of the 60 - 100  emission is associated with regions of current star formation
for these types the IR-to-blue ux ratio can be used as an indicator of relative present
IR to past measured by B passband star formation rate According to Keel 1993
for blue B magnitude

92 Star formation rate and gas density
Ms  n
g  where Ms is the stellar mass and g the
The Schmidt law Schmidt 1959
gas density has abundantly been used in the past to modelize the average star forma-
tion rate in galaxies The observational ts to this law have displayed a large dispersion
0 n 4 also present in the applications of the law to dierent regions of a same
galaxy Clearly a part of the physics associated to the star formation process is neglected
Taking account of the numerous processes at work one could have formalized SFR as
SF Rg cs ws VT cs  AB Z s Lynden-Bell 1977 where g  gas density cs 
gas sound speed ws shock frequency VT cs  shock strength   gas rotation A 
shearing rate B magnetic eld strength Z  gas metal abundance s  star density
Unfortunately it is dicult to make this dependence quantitatively explicit
The tracers introduced in the previous subsection can be used with recent data on HI
and H2 galaxy contents to rene the relation between SFR and the gas density However
we must pay attention to the fact that larger and more luminous galaxies may have more
of everything more blue stars more gas more dust For instance if H is used as a
star formation tracer SFR being proportional to LH a linear relation between total
SFR and total gas mass such as found by several authors could be due to purely scaling
eect and not to a true physical dependence The conclusion by Devereux and Young
1991 that the LF IRMH2 ratio is constant along the Hubble sequence could mean that
LF IR is simply proportional to molecular hydrogen mass without necessarily implying the
constancy of the star formation eciency SFE from Sa to Sc Sauvage and Thuan 1992
showed that in fact LF IRLH decreases towards later types Since LH is proportional to
SFR M  10 M  LF IRLH is proportional to the ratio of gas mass to SFR SFE1
The star formation eciency increases by a factor of  7 from Sa to Sd
From H and UV data it clearly appears that the SFR indicators are not well correlated
with surface density of molecular gas Average SFR is most strongly correlated either with
HI or with HI  H2 Kennicutt 1989 The important scatter must be attributed to the
extinction problem as seen above but also to the uncertainty on H2 masses and densities
extrapolated from CO measurements Large variations in the conversion factor between
CO intensity and H2 density from galaxy to galaxy have not to be excluded
Other informations on the star formation law can be inferred from comparison of SFR
and gas density within individual galaxies The relationship between H surface brightness
and the total gas density within eld and Virgo spirals which is shown in g 17 is due
to Kennicutt 1993 The gure suggests three distinct regimes for the star formation
law At high gas densities the SFR follows a Schmidt law with n  13 Below a critical
density between 1 and 10 M pc2 the relation is much steeper Well below this critical
threshold SFR is very low if not zero A more detailed study shows that for early type
galaxies the upper right quasi-linear part of the law is absent contrary to late types
93 Dynamical indicators of star formation
Cloud complexes and new stars are thought to be produced by the conjugate action of
gravity stirring from massive stars energy dissipation and magnetic forces Spontaneous
cloud formation results from combination of three instability types gravitational Parker
and thermal instabilities as described in details by Elmegreen 1992 In the calculations
reported by this author the rate at which mass is processed through the instability is
proportional to 13  15 The characteristic wavelength of the instability is  25 kpc
and the mass of the condensation  107 M  The formation of molecular clouds  106
M  can occur through condensation and dissipation inside the core of these complexes
or fragmentation of giant shells Nevertheless the details of the scenario as well as the
connection between the instabilities responsible of cloud formation and the eciency of
star formation are still too speculative to be taken into account
Twenty years ago Quirk 1972 had suggested that the star formation threshold was
associated with gravitational instabilities in the gas Guiderdoni 1987 has shown that
the observed threshold corresponds to the critical density for stability given by the Toomre
criterion
where c is the velocity dispersion of the gas see also Kennicutt 1989 So star formation
c  
onset could be characterized by Q  1 Recently several models of large-scale star for-
mation resulting from gravitational instability in disks have been proposed with the least
number of free parameters Silk 1992 Wyse and Silk 1989 Wang and Silk 1994
The starting point is the equation for the star formation rate
SF R  
where  SFE g is the gas surface density and ts is the time-scale of star formation
Wang and Silk 1994 assume that 1ts is related to the growth rate of the gravitational
instability of the gas disk Identifying 1ts with the maximum growth rate of the instability
inferred from a local linear analysis they show that
1ts 
1  Q212
g1  Q212
Q  1
This result indicates that 1 star formation occurs when Q  1 2 ts is related to 1
or 1 3 the smaller Q the more rapidly stars formed 4 SFR depends not only on g
but also on the galaxy rotation rate If Q and c are approximatively constant   g so
that SFR 2
g  Point 1 is equivalent to Quirks proposition mentioned above Let us
note with Wyse and Silk 1989 that a SFR proportional to g is able to reproduce color
and metallicity gradients in galaxy disks
If the energy dissipation is rapid and the gas gravitational instability triggers star
formation a regulation process could be started when Q is below the threshold SFR
increases the formed stars stir up the interstellar medium Q increases star formation is
stopped Q decreases etc
Friedli and Benz 1993 tested dierent prescriptions relative to SFR in view of using
the most suitable in global evolution simulation of disks It is a question of comparing the
predicted SFR sites in their star  gas evolution models described in section 7 with the
usually observed ones Four criteria for star formation were considered a priori 1 g  4
M pc2 2 Jg  1 Jeans criterion 3 Qg  14 S  0 Sentropy
As seen in g 18 this preliminary approach seems to favour the third criterion or
perhaps the fourth one which at best restores the observed zones of strong shocks obtained
in the simulations where star formation is eectively expected Other experiments based
on more elaborate physics are planned by the same authors
94 Star formation and dynamical perturbations in galaxies
Enhanced rates of star formation starbursts have been often associated in recent past
with perturbations occurring in the host systems such as bars and interactions In fact
both are able in principle and with more or less high eciency to trigger inows of gas
and accumulation of matter towards the central regions as previously explained
Enhanced star formation in the cores of SB galaxies must depend on the strength of the
bar mass and or axis ratio and on the available gas quantity The fact that for instance
only 40 of early-type SB galaxies exhibit excess 10m central emission Devereux 1987
indicates that the presence of the bar is only a necessary condition to create a starburst
Using IRAS galaxies of Hubble type Sbc to Sdm-Im from samples selected by Devereux
1987 and Young et al 1989 we observe that SA galaxies rather lie in the lower right
part of the color-color sequence dened in subsection 91 whereas SB galaxies are found
everywhere along the sequence the starburst region is essentially populated by SB galaxies
but some SBs seem quiescent see Martinet 1994 for details It would be important to
quantitatively estimate the relation between the starburst intensity and the structural
parameters of bars concerned Work in progress including star formation processes into
the evolution scheme of barred systems was planned to this eect Friedli and Benz in
preparation
Evidences that galaxy interactions can trigger starbursts have been given by various
authors table 3

Starbursts in interacting galaxies must depend on the encounter orbital parameters
and also on the gas available in the pre-encounter galaxies Advanced mergers for instance
seem to be also only a necessary condition for an enhanced IR luminosity Whereas bright
normal isolated spirals have a range of 10 m luminosity between 105 and 7  108L for
interacting galaxies the range is 4  107 to 7  109L and for mergers 4  109 to 5 
1010L These typical values correspond to a conversion of gas into early type stars in the
central few arc seconds at rates of 1 to 100 M yr1 By comparison for our Galaxy SFR
in a region of 1 kpc diameter is  0003 M yr1 Large starbursts are expected in stellar
systems that readily form molecular gas out of atomic gas Mirabel 1992 The most
luminous IR galaxies have larger LF IRMH2  MHI ratio than isolated galaxies For Arp
220 this ratio is  20 times the Milky Way value 1-3 LM 1 and  5 times the M82-
typical starburst value 5-10 LM 1 However some strongly interacting and merging
systems are not ultra-luminous in infra-red Here also it will be important to quantitatively
estimate the relation between some features of the encounter and the intensity of starburst
which could be produced The recent approach of the problem by Mihos et al 1992
1993 can be used as an example
The authors carried out 3 types of merger simulations 1 Prograde-prograde PP
halo-disk galaxy interaction the disks rotate in the same sense as their initially parabolic
orbital motion 2 retrograde-retrograde RR interaction disk rotate in the opposite sense
to the orbital motion 3 each disk plane is orthogonal to the orbital plane and to the
companion galaxy O They used Hernquists tree code Hernquist 1987 to calculate
the gravitational forces acting on stars and gas modifying it to model star formation and
interactions between gas clouds The gas consists of discrete clouds interacting with one
another through the merging of colliding clouds and fragmentation of massive clouds into
smaller ones
if two clouds are at a distance less than the size of the larger cloud they
collide and merge A continued coalescence leading to gas locked into a too small number
of too massive clouds unobserved is avoided by introduction of an exponential lifetime
i  log Mi1 In fact the real process explaining the lack of too massive clouds heating
process by star formation and supernovae is here explicitly burked
Star formation rate in each cloud is given by
Mi  CMii
where Mi is the cloud mass i the local density in a spherical region surrounding the cloud
Let us note that this law corresponds to a Schmidt law index n  18 The initial
gas depletion time is chosen so that SFR0  1-5 M yr1 In order to appraise the only
interaction eect the considered initial conditions imply neither diusion of gas toward
the center nor starburst development
Essential of a typical PP merger is the quick increase of SFR to 5 times the pre-
interaction rate followed by a decline as tidal tails develop Because of angular momentum
loss the galaxies fall back upon one another and merge by T  165 Myr A dramatic
increase of star formation factor  20 is due to a large quantity of gas falling into the
center of the remnant  50 into the inner kpc Fig 19 The lifetime of the starburst
is  200 Myrs
Actually a competition settles between the gravitational forces which draw the gas
towards the center and the energy input from the starburst which tends to disperse the
gas A very important question is what level of concentration could be reached It is
impossible to answer as long as one has not a detailed understanding of star formation
The central density able to trigger a starburst in the simulation described here is far from
that suspected in Arp 220 for instance 5 M pc3 instead of 60 M pc3 Is the used
star formation law correct in so extreme conditions
The result of RR merger is qualitatively similar to the PP case but the massive tails
are prevented by the lack of resonances between the inner rotational and orbital motions
More gas remain for a starburst which lasts 300 Myr consuming 70 of the gas
The orthogonal merger O takes longer time to reach completion 400 Myr due to
the drag minimisation on the galaxies Less gas is channelled into the central region since
the clouds suer a perturbation out of the disk plane SFR is 10 times that of an isolated
disk Only 25 of gas was consumed by the starburst
Fly-by interactions have been also studied by Mihos et al PP RR O PR The only
encounters which produce a signicant increase of SFR factor of 5 typically are PP The
formation of a bar triggers a ow of gas towards the center Enhanced star formation is
not only found in the central region but also in the outer disk However 70 of the star
formation activity occurs in the central kpc The RR and O y-by interactions are very
ineective Finally in the PR interaction 12 of gas from the prograde disk is transferred
to the retrograde one Accreted disk matter is captured on counterrotating orbits Very
eective collisions in the retrograde disk lead to ows of gas towards the center developing
a strong starburst SFR three time greater than in the isolated galaxies whereas the SFR
increase in the prograde disk is only 50
These examples suggest the tight dependence of the starburst intensity on the various
orbital features of the encounter
The results can be compared to observational data suggesting starbursts in various types
of interactions Using information on the star formation eciency SFE  LIRLCO given
by Solomon and Sage 1998 Tinney et al 1990 and Sanders et al1991 we can observe
that only some galaxies in strong interactions in process of merger show a spectacular
SFE of the order of 100 with respect to those with companions without morphological dis-
turbances or with disturbances but no tidal tails or bridges ybies for which LIRLCO
is of the order of 10-30 Star formation rates from FIR data for the same galaxies display
a large range of values from several M yr1 to more than 200 M yr1 The upper values
are obtained only for galaxies in strong interaction But it is not easy to establish one-to-
one correspondance between morphological features and starburst activity Experiments
similar to those described above including a realistic treatment of star formation will cer-
tainly allow to better understand the strong dispersion observed in the SFRs of weakly
and strongly interacting galaxies conrming the dependence of enhanced star formation
rate on the parameters characterizing the encounters To go thoroughly into the relation
between enhancements of star formation and galaxy interaction Keel 1993 analysed kine-
matical data concerning direct and retrograde pairs of galaxies Disturbances in rotation
curves can be indicators of interactions with companions Eectively in the mentioned
work high rates of star formation inferred from H data are associated with large relative
amplitudes of velocity disturbances for nuclei and integrated measures But statistically
the level of star formation is found not to be dependent on orbital direction whereas models
described before predict that y-by encounters must be direct to produce star formation
enhancements
Independently of questions of orbits and inclinations detailed studies of physical con-
ditions in the gaseous medium can also bring some enlightments on the fact that all in-
teracting galaxies do not show evidence for starburst Jog and Das 1992 suggest that if
the central molecular pressure is less than the pressure in a giant molecular cloud GMC
an incoming GMC does not suer the necessary overpressure and a starburst will not be
triggered despite gas infall due to the interaction or to a bar see also Jog and Solomon
Let us note in addition that the Mihos merger models seem to be unable to produce
starbursts which could power the ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with LF IR  1012L
The implied star formation rates would be one order greater than those predicted by
the models There exists at least three possible sources for this disagreement 1 the
protogalaxies are actually more gas rich than assumed 2 the star formation criterion based
on the Schmidt law is not correct see the previous subsection and 3 the cloud-collision
model is too crude
An other divergence between the present models and the observations concerns the sites
of star formation Mihos et al 1993 point out various cases of pairs for instance NGC
6872  IC 4970 the H maps of which show star formation along the tidal arms whereas
the model indicates the bar and the nuclear region as the only privileged sites Probably
a more rigourous approach of gas dynamics for instance concerning the viscosity could
clear up the question
10 Does a spiral galaxy change its Hubble type
during evolution
At length of the sections 2 and 4 to 9 of this review a set of processes have been discussed
which are so many clues of galaxy evolution on time scales equal or smaller than the Hubble
time Let us summarize the essential points
1 From studies on orbital behavior we learn for instance that too highly triaxial
spheroids might not exist because real equilibrium systems would not tolerate too
much chaos The conjugate eects of a bar and a compact central mass cause bulges
to secularly grow through enhanced stochastic orbital diusion The width of insta-
bility strips on the main periodic orbits which trigger radial or vertical diusion
depends on the geometry of the system which can be modied in time
2 In systems consisting of stars and gas recurrent growth of non-axisymmetric pertur-
bations must be the rule to explain the high frequency of spirals observed
3 The shape of the spheroid halo can become atter during the slow setting up of a
disk in the potential well of the spheroid
4 The friction eect between a bar and a disk or a bulge produces a transfer of angular
momentum from the bar to the disk or to the bulge Bars evolve in response to these
interactions
5 The structure of a barred galaxy perpendicularly to the disk is changed by resonant
excitations observed box or peanut shapes can be the signature of a bar
6 Satellites which merge into a disk cause thickening attening and warping of the
7 Bulges can grow by satellite accretions
8 Bars easily form in a disk they are robust unless a strong ILR be created by satellite
accretion compact mass or gas inow towards the center what contributes to destroy
the bars
9 The dissipative nature of gas plays an important role in spiral activity development
and in fueling the galactic nuclei the gas systematically losing angular momentum
to the stars
10 Dierences in the structure of early and late-type galaxies cannot be explained with-
out reference to the gaseous component the mass of which can vary in time due to
either accretion or star formation
11 Some observed phenomena such as bars within bars are episodic
12 Weak interactions between galaxies trigger spiral or bar modes Strong interactions
generate more drastic transformations Mergers of spirals can produce ellipticals
13 It is possible that the local star formation be self-regulated by the global dynam-
ics then the galaxy morphology must change over time-scales of the order of gas
consumption time scale which is shorter than the Hubble time
14 Under certain conditions galaxy interactions enhance star formation which can in
its turn inuence the subsequent dynamical evolution
Jeans 1929 postulated that galaxies evolve from elliptical to spiral and then to ir-
regular galaxies this idea which inuenced Hubble himself has been hard to kill
the seventies the initial conditions were considered as the key factor for creating the var-
ious observed morphologies elliptical and spirals Larson 1976 and Gott and Thuan
1976 introduced the ratio of the star formation to the collapse time scales sf coll as the
parameter which determines the initial evolution early-types ellipticals would result if
sf coll  1 late-types if sf coll  1
In view of the processes mentioned above it is dicult to still claim that only the initial
conditions are responsible of the diversity of the observed Hubble types Here we present
a quintessence of arguments recently put forward in favor of secular evolution through the
Hubble sequence for spirals from Sd to Sa Some ideas in this connection had been already
expressed by Kormendy 1982 particularly concerning the fate of bars
Larson 1993 recalled some theoretical predictions useful for the discussion
- The gas depletion time scale  is expected to increase by a factor of 3 along the
Hubble sequence
- The rotation period could be the basic clock for the evolution if Q  ct   1
- The spacing of arms depends on crit  42G2 A more open spiral pattern is
expected if a galaxy has either  higher or  lower
Thus the variation of the gas content as well as the star formation and the winding of
arms must be mainly inuenced by the mass distribution and the rotation rate
Now the Hubble sequence from Sd to Sa is a sequence of increasing bulge-to-disk ratio
rotation arm winding metallicity ratio of current to average past star formation rate
Which regard to the list of processes drawn up at the beginning of this section something
irreversible appears in this sequence a possible scenario could be the following Pfenniger
et al 1994  Cooling in a mostly gaseous disk  gravitational instability  formation
of a bar  secular formation of a small bulge  accumulation of mass towards the
center  dissolution of the bar into a spheroidal component Growth of bulge can be
produced by satellite mergers Moreover referring to the virial theorem and taking account
of dissipation Pfenniger 1991b it becomes clear that a galaxy could be at rst a slowly
rotating weakly concentrated object then dynamically evolves into a rapidly rotating and
more condensed one The outer parts are progressively symmetrized and arms tightly wind
As already emphasized the role of bars seems to be here essential A possible evolution
sequence resulting from our discussion could be Friedli and Martinet 1993 Sd  Sc 
Sbc  SBb  Sb  or  Sc  SBb  SBa  SBO  SO perhaps rened in S
 SB  S2B  SB  S by the bars within bars episode Such scenarios could be
either strengthened or modied by the star formation contribution for which quantitative
estimates are urgently requested in the frame of evolution simulations Furthermore the
scenario proposed above concerns essentially isolated galaxies Interactions can perturb
it It could be possible that mass inows in interacting systems change a late unbarred
galaxy into an early barred one as suggested by Elmegreen et al 1990 Their statistics
indicates a simultaneous change of Hubble type and structure SA  SB But the size
of the sample does not allow a really decisive conclusion
Including Ellipticals SO and early-type spirals in the discussion Schweizer 1993 pre-
sented some statistical arguments according to which many of these galaxies could be the
product of collisions and mergers  He suggested that the Hubble sequence may rank
galaxies mainly by the number and the vehemence of mergers in their past history Pro-
gressive mergers depend on the density In the context of hierarchy formation of galaxies
Larson 1993 distinguished Ellipticals and SO as formed from subunits of stars and spirals
as formed from subunits of gas
Study by Combes and Elmegreen 1993 already mentioned in section 73 is a starting
point to compare in details the evolution inside the early and late-type spirals Whereas
their early-type models evolve slowly late-type models evolve quickly with gas inow to-
wards the center which leads to a more condensed inner region Consequently these late-
type models evolve towards a early-type What is not under control is the possible reduction
of gas fraction by star bursts But with continuous accretion process from various origins
tidal interactions for instance evolution towards earlier type can continue In fact as we
know without infall a Sc galaxy would exhaust its gas in a small fraction of the Hubble
Kennicutt 1990 claimed that more than one evolutionary path could lead to a par-
ticular type and that many scenarios could lead identical protogalaxies to evolve into very
dierent types Taking account of the internal processes described in this review the in-
teraction eects and the changeable star formation eciency still badly understood we
must obviously not exclude these possibilities
Finally Pfenniger et al 1994 have discussed the implications of the proposed evolu-
tion on the nature of dark matter We must take into consideration the following facts
1 The ratio of dark matter to stellar mass decreases from Sds to Sas by a factor of
102 In comparison the ratio of dark to HI mass is nearly constant  10-30
2 The early types gas depleted have a declining star formation rate SFR Sbs and
Scs have a SFR  ct The latest and irregular types are the site of starbursts But average
time scale for gas consuming is of the order of 4 Gyr Either gas infall representing some
percents of total mass and or delayed gas recycling or stellar winds can solve this gas
consumption problem
The solution suggested by Pfenniger et al
1994 in order to collect these facts in
agreement with the evolution scenario from Sd to Sa is to admit that dark matter be in a
form able to create stars ie fresh diluted hydrogen A model of fractal cold gas clumpy
down to very small scales has been proposed by Pfenniger and Combes 1994
The problem of dark matter in disk galaxies could be solved to a large extent as far as
it can be proved that gas mass given by present data is underestimated by a factor of 5 to
