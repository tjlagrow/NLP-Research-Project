Abstract
The prominent interacting galaxy pair NGC 40389 contains many
active star-forming regions and is continuously forming new star clusters
We present a self-consistent n-body model for this system which includes
an SPH gas component The model qualitatively explains the apparent
concentration of gas in the so-called overlap region between the two nuclei
as a bridge of gas connecting the two galaxies Projected on the sky the
bridge appears as a dense spot of gas We discuss some implications for
the evolution of Ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
The stellar dynamics of the Antennae galaxies merger has been studied
in detail by Toomre  Toomre 1972 Barnes 1988 and others We are
interested in this merger to study star formation under extreme conditions The
gas transport towards the galaxy centers in the early stages of the mergers may
lead to circum-nuclear starbursts Tidal forces during the rst passage trigger
the formation of bars or induce m  2 spiral arm modes in the approaching
galaxies Once a bar is forming the gas piles up at the inner Lindblad resonance
which in turn undergoes rapid star formation The distribution of young stellar
clusters is therefore linked to the dynamical history of the merger
With bolometric luminosities and space densities comparable to or even
higher than those of quasars Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies ULIRGs are
the most luminous objects L1012L in the local Universe Soifer et al 1987
Deep ground based Rigopoulou et al 1999 and HSTNICMOS Scoville et al
2000 images reveal that ULIRGs are undergoing a major merger Often the
merging includes two similar size disk galaxies However the merging sequence
for ULIRGs seems to be somewhat dierent from that of lower luminosity nearby
mergers implying that perhaps ULIRGs have a dierent type of progenitor
galaxies or their gas properties are dierent
Rigopoulou et al
1999 have shown that in fact the gas properties of
ULIRGs are dierent than those of the less luminous L1011L LIRG systems
They found that although in LIRGs the CO content decreases with decreasing
separation ULIRGs appear to still be gas-rich even at advanced stages of the
merger Activity in ULIRGs is known to be in part due to star bursts and also
due to AGN activity One may speculate that AGN activity is triggered by
the merger event However no correlation between AGN activity and merger
state has been found Rigopoulou et al 1999 To explain such results we have
embarked into a project in investigating whether the ULIRG progenitor galaxies
are more stable against bar formation than other mergers Mihos  Hernquist
1996 eg due to a stronger bulge component

While not being ULIRGs themselves the Antennae galaxies provide an
excellent starting point for studying ULIRGs As a rst step we model the
Antennae system as closely as possible to explain gas distribution and present
star formation rate A nice goal is to reproduce the observed distribution of
young star clusters which are concentrated towards the so-called overlap region
and also follow some spiral arm structure Our model presented here is similar
to the model by Barnes 1988 but in addition includes a gaseous component
The n-body representation of both galaxies consists of four components The
mass ratio for bulgediskhalogas is 142308 The total number of particles
is 100000 30000 in gas The gas is treated as a single component SPH gas
initially distributed in a constant surface density disk No attempt has been
made to improve the orbital parameters as the match between the observed
and modeled distribution of stars is already quite good Star formation in the
code is turned o
The overlap region where the two disks appear to overlap in projection
corresponds in the model to a bridge between the galaxies formed by  20 of
the gas and  30 of the stars The gas fraction is likely to increase when an
exponential gas disk is used In fact both galaxies are distorted by tidal forces
into bars aligned with each other in such a way that they form a connected
V-shaped structure with the kink in the overlap region Observations indicate a
large amount of gas dust and ongoing star formation in this region Whitmore et
al 1999 Mengel et al 2000 From the time sequence of our merger simulation
we conclude that the gas in the overlap region originates mostly from inside
the disk region where the bars are formed by tidal forces But some gas also
comes from the region which was compressed rst in the collision between the
two disks ie from larger disk radii
Since the formation of the bars further amplies the compression it may not
be surprising that most young star clusters are found in that area When seen
from the side the gaseous bridge is oset by a few kpc from the stellar bars In
the model this is the time when the separation between gas and stars is largest
To understand the formation of clusters in detail a more realistic model for the
gas is required Most likely clusters are formed out of giant molecular clouds
which collapse from overpressure generated by the starburst Jog  Solomon
1992 Therefore the number of star clusters formed will also depend on the
properties of the in falling galaxies
