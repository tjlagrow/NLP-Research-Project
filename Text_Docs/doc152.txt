Abstract
I review the basic concepts for the spectrophotometric and
chemical evolution of galaxies contrast various approaches and discuss
their respective advantages and shortcomings both for the interpretation
of nearby and high redshift galaxies Focus is on recent attempts to
include gas and dust into galaxy evolution models and to account for
the links among stars gas and dust Chemically consistent models are
described that try to cope with extended stellar metallicity distributions
observed in local galaxies and with subsolar abundances in young galaxies
Introduction
For local group galaxies that can be resolved into individual stars with HST we
have seen impressively eg
in Carme Gallarts contribution how the compar-
ison of deep color magnitude diagrams with isochrones calculated from stellar
evolutionary tracks allows to trace back their Star Formation History SFH
over the last 1  3 or even more Gyr Accessing earlier phases becomes increas-
ingly dicult since stars on the Main Sequence are at or beyond the faint limits
of these observations Galaxies beyond the local group remain inaccessible for
those techniques even with 10 m telescopes
In this contribution we now turn to unresolved galaxies and to attempts to
derive information from their integrated light about their present star gas and
dust content as well as about their evolutionary path to this present state
Modelling techniques are presented in Sect 2 for the description of the
stellar light including absorption and emission eects of gas and dust In Sect
3 I present rst attempts to consistently account for the physical links between
those 3 components in galaxy models and I present a brief selection of recent
results in Sect 4 Sect 5 concludes with a brief outlook
2 Modelling Techniques
21 Basic Principles
Two fundamentally dierent approaches have been developed for the inter-
pretation of integrated spectrophotometric properties of galaxies Population
Synthesis PS and Evolutionary Synthesis ES Both of them need a com-
plete input library in terms of observed or model atmosphere stellar spectra
U Fritze  v Alvensleben
star cluster or isochrone spectra A long wavelength basis is required if infor-
mation about the SFH over cosmological timescales is to be obtained
While in the PS approach a minimisation algorithm selects a linear combi-
nation of input spectra that best ts the observed spectrum of a local galaxy or
a galaxy at known redshift z Codes may give particular weight to wavelength
regions more sensitive than others to age or metallicity and include physical
boundary conditions like some IMF or reasonable number ratios of stars in dif-
ferent evolutionary stages cf Whipple 1935 Alloin et al 1971 Faber 1972
OConnell 1976 Pickles 1985 Bica  Alloin 1986  Advantages of PS
are that very good spectral ts are possible and unexpected or discontinuous
SFHs can be discovered The basic shortcoming of this approach is that it only
provides a status quo description without information about the evolutionary
path There is still debate about the uniqueness of PS solutions
ES starts from a gas cloud of given initial mass and chemical composition
species an IMF and a SFH to successively build up the stellar population of a
model galaxy The code basically is a book-keeping algorithm that  on the basis
of a complete set of stellar evolutionary tracks  follows the evolution of the stel-
lar population through the HR diagram Assigning photometric properties like
luminosities colors and absorption features or spectra to every point or cell in
the HR diagram allows to follow the photometric or spectral evolution respec-
tively of the model galaxy from the onset of SF over a Hubble time cf Tinsley
1972 Searle Sargent  Bagnuolo 1973 Huchra 1977 Bruzual 1982 Arimoto
 Yoshii 1986 Rocca-Volmerange  Guiderdoni 1987 Buzzoni 1989 F-vA
1989 Charlot  Bruzual 1991 Worthey 1994 Poggianti 1997 Leitherer et
al 1999 Advantages of ES are that it directly desribes the time evolution to
and after the present state Evolutionary consistency is guaranteed and models
feature a large analytical potential Luminosity contributions at any wavelength
from stars of dierent masses spectral types luminosity classes and evolution-
ary phases are given in their time evolution The ES approach allows for combi-
nation with a cosmological model characterised by its parameters Ho o o
and an assumed redshift of galaxy formation zf  Major shortcomings of ES are
the facts that good ts to observed galaxy spectra are more dicult to obtain
than with PS and that unexpected SFHs are dicult to discover This points
out the complementary characters of the ES and PS approaches While for nor-
mal undisturbed galaxies average type specic SFHs are known for disturbed
or peculiar galaxies PS may provide a rst guess for their stellar content To
explore their evolutionary past and future and to allow for cosmological consid-
erations the PS solution provides a useful guide for follow-up ES modelling For
a more extensive review on synthesis techniques see F-vA 1994
In 1996 a workshop devoted to the comparison of various ES and PS codes
showed broad agreement in general and a number of discrepancies in detail
The latter turned out to be largely due to dierences in the input physics used
Of prime importance is the completeness of the stellar tracks up to the latest
evolutionary phases eg the thermal pulsing AGB phase cf Leitherer et al
Modelling Tools Population  Evolutionary Synthesis
Inclusion of Gas
Both PS and ES models as far as presented above describe the integrated light
of the stellar component of galaxies ie
they yield absorption line spectra
Emission lines observed in the spectra of SFing galaxies are evidence for the
sometimes very strong contribution of an ionised gas component HII regions
221 Gaseous emission
Gaseous emission in terms of lines and continuum is readily included into ES
and PS models on the basis of the number of Lyman continuum photons emit-
ted by all the hot O- and B-stars present in a model galaxy at a certain time
eg Huchra 1977 Mas-Hesse  Kunth 1991 Rocca-Volmerange  Guiderdoni
1988 Kruger et al 1991 1994 1995 Leitherer  Heckman 1995 Ionisation-
recombination equilibrium in ionisation-bounded Stromgren spheres that are
optically thick in the Lyman lines is assumed as well as values for the electron
temperature and density Then the continuous emission from free-free transi-
tions and recombination of H He He is obtained from atomic physics are
the uxes in the hydrogen lines Other important lines are calculated from the
ux in H using line ratios either from photoionisation models or from obser-
vations These metal-to-hydrogen-line ux ratios of course severely depend on
the metallicity of the gas A recent redetermination of the number of Lyman
continuum photons emitted by hot stars including line-blanketing non-LTE and
wind eects is given by Schaerer  deKoter 1997
222 Eects on the broad band photometry
In models for galaxies with a starburst superimposed on an undisturbed galaxys
normal SFR gaseous emission is seen to signicantly aect broad band colors
As shown in Kruger et al 1995 in bursts increasing the stellar mass of a galaxy
by 10  gaseous line emission accounts for  50  of the broad band uxes
in the optical UBVRI while gaseous continuum emission makes up  20  of
the NIR JHK uxes Moreover starburst galaxy models show that there is a
time delay of order 40 Myr until the maximum ux in the gaseous emission is
reached For dwarf galaxies with their typical burst durations of order 106 yr
the SFR has already declined to  20  of its original value by the time until
the maximum H luminosity is reached Implications for a determination of the
SFR from LH in these cases are profound
223 Gaseous absorption
Within a gas rich SFing galaxy the ux of the stellar component is largely selfab-
sorbed below the Lyman limit at 912 A by intrinsic HI producing a pronounced
break in the spectrum that for galaxies at redshifts z  2 is redshifted into the
optical Intergalactic HI mostly in the form of Ly clouds stochastically dis-
tributed along sightlines to distant galaxies provides additional absorption of
the emitted galaxy light below rest-frame Ly at 1216 A The longer the sight-
line to a galaxy the stronger becomes this attenuation Madau et al 1996 For
galaxies at z  25 35 45     the Lyman Break is shifted longwards of the
U B V  lters respectively This causes galaxies to drop out of deep short
wavelength exposures while visible in longer wavelength bands It hence pro-
vides a powerful tool to select promising galaxy candidates at high and very high
redshifts from deep multiband imaging cf Steidel et al 1995 Spectroscopy
U Fritze  v Alvensleben
of an appreciable number of those Lyman Break galaxies has conrmed their
redshift estimates
Inclusion of Dust
Now that we have seen the eects of gas absorption and emission on the inte-
grated galaxy light we turn to the eects of dust which as well come both in
absorption and emission For many years galaxy modelers used to ask observers
to deredden their galaxy spectra with respect to both foreground and internal
extinction Comprehensive galaxy models by today however attempt to include
dust and study its eects over a long wavelength range
231 Dust absorption
With a given dust content expressed eg
in terms of a value for EBV and
an assumped extinction law the eect of dust absorption is accounted for in
synthetic galaxy spectra via Fdust
gal   Fgal  1004A with AV  R  EBV
and AAV given by the extinctionabsorption law Many details and a wealth of
interesting physics are ignored in this zero-order approach as eg the geometry
of the distributions of old and young stars and dust the physical relation between
gas content metallicity and dust the temperature chemical composition grain
sizes of the dust etc Tying the amount of extinction to the evolving gas and
metal content Fioc  Rocca  Volmerange 1997 and Moller et al 1999 present
ES models with dust absorption for various galaxy types Their present-day
values for EBV are in agreement with observed local averages for the dierent
galaxy types Goudfrooij et al 1994 Ferrari et al 1999 for ES0s Gonzalez et
al 1998 for spirals Individual galaxies show considerable scatter around these
average values Only on a long wavelength basis may a comparison between
models and observations provide conclusive information about the amount of
dust absorption Extrapolation of this approach into the Early Universe with
its intense radiation eld remains uncertain
232 Dust emission
Energy conservation requires the total amount of ux absorbed in the UV and
optical to be reemitted at long wavelengths FIR and submm
LFIRsubmm  R 2
Fgal  Fdust

Thermal emission of dust eventually heated by young stars or shocks pro-
duces a blackbody spectrum for the appropriate temperatures of the dust
phases plus characteristic line and PAH-band contributions cf Sturm et al
2000 Models including dust emission are eg presented by Franceschini et al
1994 Silva et al 1998 Devriendt et al 1999
3 Links between Stars Gas and Dust
31 Chemically consistent models
As rst described quantitatively by B Tinsley in the 70s the gas in galaxies
is continuously enriched by metals produced in stars and set free towards the
end of their lifes by stellar winds planetary nebulae or supernovae Hence in
Modelling Tools Population  Evolutionary Synthesis
galaxies that always have SF extending over timescales that are long compared to
stellar lifetimes successive generations of stars will be born with increasing initial
metallicities This is observed in the extended metallicity distributions of stars
in elliptical galaxies and bulges  covering more than a factor 10 in metallicity
Z with hZi  1
2  Z McWilliam  Rich 1994 Sadler et al 1996 Ramirez et
al 2000  and of G- K- and M-dwarf stars in the solar neighbourhood  also
covering a factor 10 in Z with hZi  07  Z Rocha  Pinto  Maciel 1996
In principle PS using a star cluster library covering the full range of ages
and metallicities and extending over a long enough wavelength range should be
able to recover the intrinsic metallicity distribution of the stars in its best t
solution to an integrated galaxy spectrum cf Bica et al 1988
With the availability of complete sets of input physics for various metallicities
we developed Chemically Consistent Evolutionary Synthesis CCES models
in Gottingen They follow the enrichment of the gas and account for the in-
creasing initial metallicity of successive generations of stars by using several sets
of input physics  stellar evolutionary tracks stellar yields model atmospheres
color and index calibrations  for metallicities in the range 00001  Z  005
and yield stellar metallicity distributions for elliptical and Sb galaxies in agree-
ment with observations
For the CCES models average galaxy wide SFHs are determined by the require-
ment that after  12 Gyr of evolution they agree with observations of nearby
galaxies in terms of colors luminosities absorption features for ES0s emis-
sion line strengths spirals and template spectra from UV to NIR In order to
reach the observed galaxy colors and luminosities despite the contributions from
intrinsically bluer and more luminous lower metallicity subpopulations CCES
models have to use SFHs somewhat dierent from those in models using solar
metallicity input physics only This causes a dierence in the evolution of galax-
ies that increases with lookback time even for those types which by today reach
close to solar average abundances
The well-known age  metallicity degeneracy Worthey 1994 describes
the fact that two single age single metallicity stellar populations one of which is
younger by a factor 2 and more metal rich by a factor 3 than the other are indis-
tinguishable in terms of optical broad band colors and spectral continuum shape
To resolve this ambiguity less age dependent NIR colors or absorption features
specically sensitive to age like H or metallicity like Fe5270 or Fe5335 have
to be considered CCES models show that in normal Hubble types of galax-
ies which in this respect are well approximated by closed box models age
and metallicity of the stellar population are coupled and the coupling
depends on the SFH cf F-vA 2000
4 Results from CCES models
41 Chemically Consistent Spectrophotometric Evolution
The fact that stellar subpopulations of dierent ages have dierent metallici-
ties and dominate dierent regions of the spectrum causes galaxies to feature
dierent metallicities at dierent wavelengths In Moller et al 1997 we present
a quantitative analysis of this wavelength dependence of luminosity weighted
metallicities in ellipticals and spirals
U Fritze  v Alvensleben
CCES models can be combined with a cosmological model eg Ho  50 o  1
to study the redshift evolution of galaxy colors and luminosities Comparison
with solar metallicity models shows that cc spiral models become brighter by
 1  05 mag in B K at redshifts z  05 We thus expect higher num-
bers of early and even late-type spirals to contribute to faint galaxy counts and
hence less of a Faint Blue Galaxy Excess cf F-vA 1999 Moller et al in
prep CCES models for spirals show good agreement both in terms of lumi-
nosity and color evolution and in SFRs with the rst set of spectroscopically
conrmed Lyman Break Galaxies from the HDF Lowenthal et al 1997 over
the redshift range from z  2 to z  35 On the basis of our 1-zone models
it cannot be decided however if this SF occurs in the bulges or all over the
disks of those young spirals From the weakness of O- B-stellar wind lines in
KECK HIRES spectra Trager et al 1997 derive metallicities for Lyman Break
Galaxies at z  3  4 around 1
10  Z in agreement with the predictions of our
CCES models for bright early type spirals
42 Chemically Consistent Chemical Evolution
Stellar yields for individual chemical elements Xi show a very complex behaviour
as a function of metallicity and stellar mass cf Figs 1 2 in Lindner et al 1999
SFHs that after a Hubble time gave agreement of our spectrophotometric CCES
models with observations immediately produced absolute oxygen abundances in
good agreement with observed characteristic HII region abundances ie mea-
sured at  1 Re of the respective spiral types without any additional free pa-
rameters or scaling The redshift evolution of abundances in CCES models
diers from that in models using solar metallicity input physics only in a way
characteristic for every element
Damped Ly Absorption is caused by intervening high column density
gas log NHI  203 cm2 along our lines of sight to distant quasars The
radiation damped Ly lines are always associated with a number of low ioni-
sation lines of elements like Al Si S Fe Ni Mn Cr Zn at the same redshift
High resolution spectra resolving the velocity structure in these lines typically
 5  10 km s1 allow for precise abundance determinations In recent years
those have become available for a large number of absorbers over the redshift
range from z  0 to z  44 ie over more than 90  of the age of the Universe
eg Pettini et al 1999 Conventionally DLA absorption was thought to arise
in proto-galactic disks Wolfe 1995 Line prole shapes are consistent with this
view and indicate that DLA disks at z  2  3 already have rotation velocities
and hence masses comparable to those of local spiral disks Prochaska  Wolfe
1997 Nevertheless other possible origins for DLA systems are discussed like
starbursting dwarf or low surface brightness galaxies at low z Matteucci et al
1997 Jimenez et al 1999 and subgalactic fragments bound to merge at high z
Haehnelt et al 1998
In Lindner et al 1999 we compare our CCES models for spirals includ-
ing SNIa contributions from carbon deagration in white dwarf binaries to
DLA abundances The basic result from the comparison of all 8 elements with
signicant numbers of abundance determinations is that over the full redshift
range from z  44 to z  0 cc spiral models are well consistent with the DLA
data Hence from the point of view of abundance evolution DLA absorption
Modelling Tools Population  Evolutionary Synthesis
may well be caused by normal spiral galaxies allthough other possible origins
are not excluded DLA abundances at high redshift are in evolutionary con-
sistency with present-day HII region abundances The decreasing gas content
explains the lower rate of incidence of DLA galaxies at low redshift as compared
to expectations from high redshift and it causes a change in the DLA absorber
population with redshift While at high z all spiral types from Sa through Sd
seem to contribute to the DLA population the gas poor and high metallicity Sa
and Sb galaxies seem to drop out of DLA samples towards lower redshift This
change with redshift that we predict for the DLA absorber population is consis-
tent with and makes us understand the non-detection of many DLA absorbers in
deep searches The luminosities that our CCES models predict B  25 R  25
K  22 mag cf F-vA et al 1999 make DLA galaxies challenging targets for
10 m telescopes
The ISM abundance evolution as a function of redshift given by our spiral
models can be used to predict metallicities of stars star clusters and Tidal Dwarf
Galaxies forming in the course of mergers and the starbursts they can trigger
F-vA  Gerhard 1994a b Spectroscopy of those objects in turn provides
an independent cross check of their parent galaxies abundance evolution and
has conrmed our predictions in several cases Schweizer  Seitzer 1998 Duc
 Mirabel 1998 The metallicity of all these objects is crucial for age-dating
mass-to-light ratios and for their future luminosity and color evolution F-vA
 Burkert 1995 F-vA 1998 1999
43 SSP Models
Having available the input physics for dierent metallicities not only galaxy but
also single burst single metallicity models  Simple Stellar Population models
can be calculated Kurth et al 1999 Those not only provide the luminosity
color and absorption index evolution directly comparable to star cluster data but
also a useful tool for the implementation into any kind of dynamical or cosmolog-
ical galaxy formation and evolution model if only it contains a SF criterion Any
kind of composite stellar population no matter how complex its SFH may be is
readily expanded into a series of SSPs and its luminosity evolution is obtained
from a superposition of those of the respective SSPs In Contardo et al 1998
we present a rst attempt to supplement the hydro-cosmological formation and
evolution of a protogalaxy with observables using SSP results We have recently
completed a new set of SSP models including the detailed spectral evolution
Schulz et al  in prep They are based on Padova isochrones that extend the
stellar evolutionary tracks used by Kurth et al to include the thermal pulsing
AGB phase
5 Outlook
Contrasting the two basic approaches to model galaxy spectra  evolutionary
and population synthesis  I pointed out their respective advantages and short-
comings as well as their complementary character when dealing with complex
or unexpected star formation histories Originally both approaches describe the
stellar content Contributions of gas and dust both in emission and absorption
are now being included by various groups Very rst attempts are reported to
U Fritze  v Alvensleben
consistently account for the physical links between these 3 galaxy components
They still are restricted to very simplied 1-zone closed box models with only one
gas phase to keep the number of parameters restrictable Observations allow-
ing by today to resolve galaxies out to large distances call for spatially resolved
models that include the dynamics of all components and phases and also include
eects of environment or even embed a galaxy into its cosmological context The
increasing number of parameters in those kinds of models can only be balanced
by comprehensive observations of spectral chemical and dust properties at all
wavelengths
