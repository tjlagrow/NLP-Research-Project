Abstract We explore the connection between dierent classes of active
galactic nuclei AGNs and the evolution of their host galaxies by deriving
host galaxy properties clustering and Eddington ratios of AGNs selected in the
radio X-ray and infrared IR wavebands from the wide-eld 9 deg2 Bootes
survey We study a sample of 585 AGNs at 025  z  08 using redshifts from
the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey AGES We nd that radio and X-ray
AGNs reside in relatively large dark matter halos Mhalo  3  1013 and 1013
h1 M respectively and are found in galaxies with red and green colors In
contrast IR AGNs are in less luminous galaxies have higher Eddington ratios
and reside in halos with Mhalo  1012 M We interpret these results in terms
of a general picture for AGNs and galaxy evolution in which quasar activity is
triggered when Mhalo  10121013 M after which star formation ceases and
AGN accretion shifts to optically-faint X-ray and radio-bright modes
Introduction
It is increasingly clear that a role in galaxy evolution is played by active galactic
nuclei AGNs as suggested by the tight correlation between supermassive black
hole SMBH mass and galaxy bulge properties eg Magorrian et al 1998
Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et al 2000 and the ability of AGN feed-
back to regulate star formation in galaxy formation models eg Bower et al
2006 Hopkins et al 2006 Croton et al 2006 Khalatyan et al 2008 Bower et al
2008 Dierent modes of accretion may play varying roles in galaxy evolution
eg Merloni  Heinz 2008 Kaumann  Heckman 2008 and observational
clues to the links between AGN and galaxies come from the host properties
and dark matter halo masses of dierent classes of AGNs In general low-level
accretion is relatively bright in the radio and X-rays while AGNs with higher
accretion rates are readily detected in the optical and IR Radio-selected AGNs
are generally found in luminous red-sequence galaxies in massive dark matter
halos eg Mandelbaum et al 2008 while X-ray AGNs reside in galaxies with
green colors and somewhat less massive halos eg Silverman et al 2008
Gilli et al 2008 Optical quasars are found in halos of mass  3  1012 M at
all redshifts eg Croom et al 2005 Shen et al 2007 These results indicate
that the dierent modes of accretion occur at dierent phases in galaxy evolu-
tion Here we present a study of the host galaxies clustering and Eddington
ratios for three classes of AGNs radio X-ray and IR-selected in the 9 deg2
Bootes eld and compare our results to a simple picture of AGN and galaxy
evolution We use a cosmology with m  03   07 h  07 and 8  09
the observations and results are described in detail in Hickox et al 2009

2 Observations and AGN sample
We use data from the 9 deg2 Bootes multiwavelength survey with optical pho-
tometry from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Jannuzi  Dey 1999 X-
ray data from the Chandra XBootes survey Murray et al 2005 Spitzer IRAC
data from the IRAC Shallow Survey Eisenhardt et al 2004 radio data from
the Westerbork Radio Telescope 14 GHz radio survey de Vries et al 2002
and redshifts from MMTAGES C Kochanek et al 2009 in preparation
We select 6262 galaxies and 585 AGNs in the redshift interval 025  z  08
We select 122 radio AGNs with P14 GHz  6  1023 W Hz1 362 X-ray AGNs

logLbolLEdd
Figure 2 Distributions in Eddington ratios for AGNs with extended optical
counterparts The Lbol and LbolLEdd estimates for the X-ray undetected
radio AGNs show only upper limits derived from X-ray stacking Radio X-
ray and IR AGNs have progressively higher typical Eddington ratios
with LX  1042 ergs s1 and 238 IR AGNs using the color-color criterion of
Stern et al 2005 Only 19 of the radio AGNs are selected in either X-rays or
the IR although there is  3050 overlap between the X-ray and IR samples
for details on this overlap sample see Hickox et al 2009
3 AGN host galaxies clustering and Eddington ratios
We rst derive host galaxy colors and luminosities Fig 1 left for AGNs with
extended optical counterparts for which the nucleus is optically faint or ob-
scured We include a small color correction  02 mag to account for residual
contamination from the nucleus We nd that radio AGNs mainly reside in
luminous red galaxies while X-ray AGNs have a signicant peak in the green
valley of the color distribution as seen in other surveys eg Sanchez et al
2004 Nandra et al 2007 The IR AGNs have similar colors to the X-ray AGNs
but with a smaller green peak and with lower average luminosities
We next derive characteristic halo masses of the dierent AGN types for all
AGNs including optically-unresolved sources by measuring the projected two-
point cross-correlation function wprp between AGNs and AGES galaxies on
scales of 03  rp  10 h1 Mpc Fig 1 right Fitting a 3-D cross-correlation
function of the form   rr0 we obtain r0 h1 Mpc   63 06 18 
02 for radio AGNs 4703 1601 for X-ray AGNs and 3704 1501
for IR AGNs Using the autocorrelation of the AGES galaxies and a model of
dark matter clustering Smith et al 2003 we then derive the absolute bias
of the dark matter halos that host the AGNs and convert the bias to Mhalo
Sheth et al 2001 We obtain log Mhaloh1M  13501
02 for radio AGNs
12902
03 for X-ray AGNs and 11706
Finally we derive Eddington ratios   LbolLEdd for the AGNs with
extended optical counterparts Fig 2 We estimate MBH from the LbulgeMBH
relation Marconi  Hunt 2003 and derive Lbol using X-ray and IR bolometric
corrections Hopkins et al 2007 Radio AGNs have very low Eddington ratios
  103 while X-ray AGNs have intermediate ratios 103
   1 and IR
AGNs have high ratios   001

4 Evolutionary picture
Our results are generally consistent with a simple picture of SMBH and galaxy
evolution Fig 3 motivated by recent observational and theoretical studies As
dark matter halos increase in mass through the hierarchical growth of structure
galaxies initially form as cold gas-rich star-forming systems with rotationally-
dominated dynamics When the dark matter halo reaches a mass Mcrit  1012
1013 M shown by the ovals in Fig 3 starburst and luminous AGN quasar
activity is fueled for example by a major galaxy merger or disk instabilities Sub-
sequently star formation is quenched either by quasar feedback Hopkins et al
2006 or by the creation of a virialized hot halo of gas that can no longer
eciently cool Dekel  Birnboim 2006 At later times and higher masses
lower-Eddington X-ray and radio-bright accretion eg Churazov et al 2005
may help prevent star formation eg Bower et al 2006 Croton et al 2006
In this picture our observed population of radio AGNs represents a low-
Eddington mode of accretion found in passive galaxies with high-mass halos
Clustering host galaxies and evolution of AGN
Mhalo  Mcrit These galaxies have already experienced the quasar phase and
the quenching of star formation The observed X-ray AGNs are in a somewhat
higher-Eddington phase that occurs in halos closer to Mcrit during the transi-
tion of the galaxy from the blue cloud to the red sequence while the observed
IR-selected AGNs are the highest-Eddington population found in star-forming
galaxies with small black holes and dark matter halos that have not yet grown
to Mcrit This simple evolutionary picture naturally accounts for the observed
trends in host galaxies clustering and Eddington ratios of the dierent classes
of AGNs In the future we will explore this scenario in more detail by comparing
our results with detailed predictions of galaxy formation models
