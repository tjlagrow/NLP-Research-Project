Abstract
Infrared surveys provide essential insights on galaxy evolution If near-IR studies suggest mild
evolution of stellar populations with cosmic time indications of a substantial evolution have
been seen in the far-IR although the available information is largely insucient to delineate
precise evolutionary properties
A consistent picture encompassing all the currently available data may be obtained assuming
that dust extinction hides the early evolutionary phases of spheroidal galaxies in the optical
band while the corresponding dust re-radiation in the far-IR may have been during the early
evolutionary phases orders of magnitude larger than today Hyperluminous IRAS galaxies might
be extreme examples of this situation Additional indications that at least some spheroidal
galaxies may have been very dusty during their early evolution are provided by recent data on
high redshift radio galaxies and quasars
Galaxies are the likely dominant contributors to the IR background However in the frame-
work of unied models for Active Galactic Nuclei a large number of nuclei hidden by a dusty
torus may be expected Implications for the IR background are discussed
1 Galaxy evolution in the optical-IR General observational trends
Optical surveys have constituted for many years the primary tool to investigate the photometric
evolution of galaxies reecting the evolution of stellar populations CCD detectors have allowed
to reach extremely faint magnitudes down to B  2728 ie to surface densities as high as
 3  105 galaxies deg2 A remarkable excess over a smooth extrapolation from brighter
magnitudes was observed in the B-band counts beginning at B  20 and continuing to the
faintest levels
Counts and colors indicated a substantial increase with look-back time of the surface density
of blue galaxies consistent with evolutionary stellar population synthesis models provided that
the universe has a low density q0  005 and galaxies form at high redshifts zfor  30
The observed redshift distributions of galaxies down to B  2224 however cannot be
accounted for by pure luminosity evolution models at least if the local luminosity function keeps
relatively at at its faint end Various explanations have been proposed resorting to either
density evolution 1 or to luminosity dependent evolution 2 or to a non-zero cosmological
constant 3 on the other hand Gronwall and Koo 35 obtained good ts to the data with
a standard photometric evolution model with a SMC extinction law assuming a strong excess
still consistent with the data of low luminosity galaxies over the Schechter luminosity function
Crucial constraints concerning in particular the eects of dust in high-z galaxies 4 come
from observations at infrared wavelengths A great observational stride occurred thanks to the
impressively fast advances in infrared array technology which have already made possible to
reach a limiting magnitude K  23 5 6 ie surface densities  2  105 deg2 close to those of
the deepest optical surveys
Unlike optical counts which are highly responsive to young stellar populations hence prone
to very uncertain K-corrections and biased against early-type galaxies near-infrared counts are
much less sensitive to the detailed star-formation history By allowing a more straightforward
interpretation they are going to set much tighter constraints on galaxy evolution
The extremely interesting new result was that counts in the K band show a remarkable
attening below K  20 at variance with the steep counts observed in the optical
In the far-IR the rst indication that the IRAS galaxy population evolves signicantly came
from 60 m counts performed at the faintest ux levels 7 8 and at medium sensitivities 9 The
more detailed information made available by redshift surveys 10 suggests a strongly evolving
luminosity function with a luminosity evolution rate comparable to that of quasars
Lz  L01  z33
The redshift space however was sampled by the IRAS survey only to z  02 not enough to
distinguish between luminosity and density evolution The limited sampled volume also implies
that the estimate of the evolution rate in eq 1 is possibly aected by large-scale structure
An underdensity by a factor of roughly two in the local universe has been invoked to interpret
the very steep counts of galaxies in the optical at B  18 in particular from the APM survey
in the southern sky 11
Near- and far-IR selections emphasize quite dierent physical processes in galaxies photo-
spheric emission of red giant stars mostly unaected by diuse dust in the K band and dust
re-radiation powered by young stellar populations at far-IR wavelengths To best exploit the
information content of the two bands we need a tool to relate the properties of the ISM gas
fraction metal abundance and dust content with those of the stellar populations The next
chapter is devoted to discuss such a tool
2 A comprehensive view on galaxy evolution the basic recipes
Evolutionary population synthesis EPS models which account for dust eects have been
worked out by 12 13 Given their large spectral coverage from ultraviolet to 1 mm these
models allow a synoptic view of data relevant to understand galaxy evolution They deal in
a self-consistent way with chemical and photometric evolution of a galaxy over four decades
in wavelength The synthetic spectral energy distribution SED incorporates stellar emission
internal extinction and re-emission by dust The stellar contribution including all evolutionary
phases of stars born with dierent metallicities extends up to 25 m Dust includes a cold
component heated by the general radiation eld and a warm component associated with HII
regions Emission from policyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules PAH and from circumstellar
dust shells are also taken into account
The star formation rate SFR and the initial mass function IMF are the basic input
functions The most critical parameter whose variation is able to account for the whole Hubble
sequence is the initial value of the SFR 0 Low values of 0 correspond to a SFR slowly
decreasing with time the standard scenario for latetype systems high values of 0 provide a
drastically dierent behaviour due to the fast decreasing of the gas fraction hence of the SFR
this corresponds to earlytype systems
Models successfully match the SED of local galaxies of dierent morphological type over
four decades in frequency 12 13 In the following we will refer to models computed with
a Salpeter IMF and a SFR depending on a power law of the mass of gas SFR  M n
gas with
n  05 This corresponds to a quick metal enrichment and a prompt contamination by dust
of the interstellar medium earlytype systems become bright farFIR sources given the high
optical depth provided by these models during their initial evolution
3 Observational tests of the evolution
The evolution with cosmic time of stellar populations in galaxies can be directly investigated by
looking at the spectral energy distribution SED of galaxies at dierent redshifts Normal
high-z galaxies however proved to be remarkably elusive none of the 100 out of a total of
104 galaxies with measured redshift in the sample of Colless et al 14 complete to B  225
has z  07 the highest redshift in the complete B  24 sample of Cowie et al 15 is z  073
the measured redshifts of near-IR selected galaxies down to K  20 16 nearly 100 complete
at K  18 and  70 complete at K  1920 are  1 with the exception of one object at
z  235
So far the only eective method to nd high-z galaxies has been optical identications of ra-
dio sources 17 far-IRsub-mm observations of these objects are providing extremely important
indications on the properties of young galaxies
In the following we will briey review recent observational results in the near-IR and far-
IRsub-mm bands
31 Near-IRselected galaxy samples
Impressive results have been recently obtained by the IfA team at Hawaii 16 18 Figures
1 and 2 compare the data of 16 with synthetic colours yielded by models described in the
previous section
We note that evolutionary eects in the spectra of earlytype systems cannot be neglected
at z  1 the use of template SEDs of local objects to infer photometric redshifts of galaxies
lacking spectroscopy may be misleading We have compared in particular the colours of the
16 unidentied galaxies in the K-band selected sample by 16 and found that most of them are
likely to be at z  1 A higher SFR implies bluer colours at z  1 than expected by simply
reshifting local SEDs
Note in any case that both the red peak in the colours at z  1 and the subsequent blueing
strongly depend on the adopted cosmological model in particular colours I  K  5 are
dicult to obtain in a closed world model
Indications in favour of a merging-driven evolution in which galaxies become more numerous
but less luminous in the past have been found eg by 18 Alternatively we nd that taking
into account the combined spectral eects of the evolving stellar populations and of extinction
by dust all the basic statistical properties of K-band selected galaxies can be explained by pure
luminosity evolution of the observed local luminosity functions We account in particular for
the blueing trend observed at K  19 and z  1 as an evolutionary eect due to the higher
SFR rather than a change in the galaxy population mixture
A world model with q0  015 and zform  7 for earlytype and zform  2 for late-type
galaxies is indicated by ts of the observed counts local luminosity functions redshift and
colour distributions
32 Far-IR and radio-selected samples
Earlytype models including a dusty phase during their initial evolution also match successfully
the observed spectrum of the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS F 10214  4724 at z229 19
Fig 3 we compare the observed SED with model predictions a non-thermal contribution 20
accounting for 60 of the restframe ux at   01 m has also been included
Fig 4 panels ac compares in the restframe the data on three distant radio galaxies
having recent sub-mm measurements or upper limits 21 22 with our synthetic SEDs The
available data can be fully accounted for by opaque models like those used by 19 to t the
spectrum of IRAS F 10214  4724 The inferred galactic ages are  01 Gyr thus alleviating
the problem of galaxy ages uncomfortably high in comparison with the age of the universe as
well as the diculty to understand the alignement between opticalinfrared continua and the
presumably short lived radio jets 23
IR emission of AGNs
The infrared luminosity is often a signicant fraction of the bolometric luminosity of AGNs
In the case of radio quiet AGNs the origin of the IR emission is still debated although in
the last few years observational evidence has accumulated in favour of dust reprocessing of the
primary opticalUV emission Major issues in favour of dust emission are cf 20 and references
therein i the observed SEDs showing a steep rise of the submillimetric continuum between
1000 and 100 m which is far too steep for any current nonthermal model and a local minimum
in F at   1m which is naturally explained by models wherein dust radiates with a limiting
sublimation temperature Ts  1500 K ii the IR variability and its relationship with UV and
optical variability with delays among dierent bands which are easily interpreted in dust models
and iii the observed low level of polarization
Presence of optically thick dust with azimuthal symmetry has been also advocated to ex-
plain the observed dierence between broad and narrowline AGN in the framework of unied
schemes see 24 for a comprehensive review As is well known spectropolarimetric data have
shown that broad lines also are visible in polarized light in narrow-line nuclei More recently
infrared spectroscopy in the nearIR revealed the presence of broad components in hydrogen
IR lines see eg
25 suggestive of the possibility of a direct view of broadline regions in
the IR Less direct evidence of dust around active nuclei has been found through studies of
ionization cones in several Seyfert 2 galaxies which demonstrate that the gas in the host galax-
ies sees anisotropic ionizing sources Also Xray observations revealed high absorbing columns
NHI  1023 1025cm2 in many Seyfert 2 galaxies whereas Seyfert 1 X-ray spectra exhibit
moderate to low absorption
Structure and emission of dust tori or warped discs around AGNs have been investigated
by several authors 26 20
In the case of tori dust is assumed to have standard galactic
composition size distribution and sublimation temperature Various structures have been in-
vestigated depending on equatorial optical depth covering factor shape radial and axial dust
density distribution The models can be broadly divided in two classes A rst one includes
models with extremely high optical depths AV  500 and extremely compact structure the
ratio of the outer rout to the inner radius rin of the dust distribution ranges from few to several
tens Typical problems of these models are that torus emission does not t the observed spectra
and surface brightnesses of Seyfert 1 and 2 unless additional dust components are invoked see
eg 26
The second family of models requires less extreme optical depth AV  100 and more
extended tori rinrout  few hundreds 20 These models have the nice properties of tting
the observed SEDs and of predicting a size of the region emitting at midIR extending over
several tens of parsecs in agreement with the observations Moreover the predicted anisotropy
of the 10m emission is within the limits required by the comparison of the luminosity functions
of type 1 and type 2 Seyferts 27
If the latter models hold the 12 m luminosity functions of the two Seyfert types 28 and the
statistics of the ratio of hard Xray to 12 m uxes 29 indicate that not many hidden AGNs
exist At most 20 of Seyfert 1 and 50 of Seyfert 2 galaxies could have been misidentied
as nonactive Moreover the nonlinear relation L12  L07
HX suggests that the covering factor
decreases with increasing source power 29
5 Contributions to the background ux
In the absence of dust extinction the diuse radiation generated by early stellar nucleosynthesis
is expected to peak in the near-IR and to have a bolometric intensity
0007c3fm
41  zF 
erg cm2 s1 sr1
where zf is the galaxy formation redshift  is the density of the processed material to produce
a mass fraction fm of metals Dust eventually re-radiates this energy at longer wavelengths
Estimates of the IR background intensity have been attempted in the near-IR and sub-mm
bands where the bright foreground emissions from the Galaxy and Inter-Planetary Dust IPD
are at a minimum In any case careful modelling and subtraction of foregrounds is necessary
A summary of recent results is shown in Fig 5
51 The near-IR background
The thick solid line labelled d in Fig 5 shows the contribution of starlight as implied by
models described in 31 This estimate is quite a robust one constrained as it is by existing
deep counts of galaxies in K band The predicted spectral shape is also well constrained up to
  5m by our present understanding of photometric evolution
The tightest observational limits come from observations of very high-energy TeV -rays
in the spectra of the BL Lac object Mkn 421 and follow from the fact that a ux of extragalactic
-rays is attenuated by interactions with ambient photons leading to the production of electron-
positron pairs 30 31 These limits are consistent with the near-IR background mostly
originating from ordinary stellar processes in galaxies
Also reported in Figure 5 is the estimated nal sensitivity of DIRBE on COBE which
in principle would allow accurate determinations of the extragalactic background ux from 1
to 200 m As already mentioned however the main limiting factor are uncertainties in the
estimates of the foreground components
52 The farIRsubmm background
In Fig 5 the lines labelled a b c show predictions of detailed evolutionary models while
the thin line is based on simpler kinematical prescriptions tting the 60 m statistic 32 We see
an appreciable latitude in such predictions Note however that the extreme curves a and c
bound a sort of conservative allowed region the former curve assuming no evolution being
already inconsistent with 60 m counts the latter corresponding to an evolution rate probably
inconsistent with the observed lack of high-z galaxies among faint IRAS sources8
The prediction of the kinematic model implies an higher ux level at mm wavelenghts as it
assumes a dust temperature distribution constant with time Physical models predict a lower
mm background because dust gets warmer in the past following the increase of the SFR and of
the average radiation eld in galaxies
The various observational limits set by re-analyses of IRAS survey data 10 by the COBE-
FIRAS all-sky spectra deconvolved from the Galaxy emission 33 and by rocket observations
34 are within a factor of a few of the expected extragalactic ux The latter turns out to be
very close to the sensitivity limits of current observations
53 A mid-IR background from hot dust in AGNs
At the minimum between the predicted starlight background in the near-IR and the dust re-
radiation feature in the far-IR there is a spectral region 5    20 m in which properties
of even local galaxies are very poorly known essentially because of the poor sensitivity of
IRAS at these wavelengths Existing data suggest in any case that the integrated emission of
normal galaxies should keep below 3  106 erg cm2 s1 sr1 unless dust with implausibly high
temperature characterizes the early evolution phases
As previously discussed dust hot enough to emit at these wavelengths is likely to be present
in AGNs The corresponding contribution to the mid-IR background is set by the convolution
of the local IR volume emissivity of AGNs with their evolution rate We report in Fig 5 line
marked AGN a crude estimate based on the 12 m luminosity function of type 1 and 2 Seyfert
galaxies by 28 and an evolution rate equal to that of optical QSOs eq1 extrapolated to
zmax  4 with q0  005 The adopted IR spectra for the two AGN types are the average SED
of Seyfert 1 nuclei and the SED of NGC 1068 20 The IR luminosity function of Seyferts 2 has
been renormalized upwards by a factor 4 to account for the fraction of optically undetected dust
extinguished AGNs predicted by the unied AGN model We see that with these somewhat
extreme ingredients the contribution of dusty AGNs in the range 1050 m may exceed those
of other galaxy populations
