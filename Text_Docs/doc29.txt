Abstract
Hawking radiation can be derived from the collapsing process of matter to form
a black hole In this work we show in more detail that the freely infalling process of
a probe D-particle or point-like object in a non-extreme black hole background is
essentially a tachyon condensation process That is a probe D-particle will behave
as an unstable D-particle in the near-horizon region of a non-extreme black hole
From this point of view Hawking radiation can be viewed as the thermal radiation
from rolling tachyon on an unstable D-particle ie the infalling probe at the Hage-
dorn temperature The result has interesting implications to tachyon cosmology
the uniform tachyon rolling in cosmology can automatically create particle pairs at
late times via a mechanism just like the Hawking radiation process near a black
hole So this particle creation process can naturally give rise to a hot universe with
thermal perturbations beyond tachyon ination providing an alternative reheating
mechanism
Introduction
It is known that strings can be created and radiated from evolving unstable D-branes or
S-branes whose dynamics can be described by various open-sting tachyon eld theories
that are believed to be equivalent It is found in boundary conformal eld theory BCFT

in 1 2 3 that open-string pairs can be created from rolling tachyon at the Hagedorn
temperature This implies that most or all energy of the tachyon is transferred into closed
string radiation 4 5 6 7 Indeed the study 6 7 shows that an unstable D-particle
or wrapped unstable Dp-brane p  2 will completely decay into closed strings mainly
massive ones However it is hard to extract exact information about this intense energy
release process due to strong back reaction Moreover the results are mainly investigated
in BCFT In the tachyon eective eld theory and other string eld theories they are not
really seriously veried
In a previous work 8 we found that a probe particle infalling in Rindler space should
behave as an unstable particle This reveals that the dynamics near non-extreme black
holes can be described by a time-dependent tachyon eld theory This connection makes
it possible to understand better one side of this dual-like description from the other From
knowledge of tachyon condensation we learn that material collapsing into a non-extreme
black hole should encounter a phase transition at the Hagedorn temperature and should
decay into gravitons or generally closed strings completely mainly very massive ones
before reaching the horizon We have also shown that the information of the material
collapsing into black holes should be stored in these gravitons
On the other hand one can also learn some useful information about tachyon con-
densation from black hole thermodynamics First we can know that the rolling tachyon
should really produce thermal radiation with the Hagedorn temperature equal to the cor-
responding Hawking temperature Second we may get more accurate information about
the closed-string emission from tachyon condensation if we agree that the degenerated
states of closed strings emitted from an infalling particle should be responsible for the
increased entropy in the black hole due to absorption of the particle
In this work we shall focus on the correlation between Hawking radiation from black
holes and thermal radiation from tachyon We shall show in more detail than in the
previous work 8 that infalling particle attracted by gravitational force of a non-extreme
black hole will behave as an unstable D-particle approaching the event horizon and will
give rise to thermal particle-pair creation via tachyon condensation We argue that this
particle creation process from the infalling probe provides an alternative explanation to
the Hawking radiation from the black hole We further show that this has interesting
applications in the tachyon cosmological model which is also constructed based on the
tachyon eective theory
The tachyon driven cosmology 9 10 11 12 13 has the merit that it can give a
unied description of ination dark matter and even dark energy 14 as time grows
However this model is thought problematic in some aspects 12 15 13 One of the key
problems is that a sensible reheating mechanism expected after ination is hard to be
realised in this model since the tachyon eld does not oscillate around the minimum of
the asymptotic potential 13 The mechanisms proposed in past years usually involve
the assistance of companion elds coupling the evolving tachyon to massless elds like
gauge elds 16 17 18 or introducing extra curvaton eld 19 In this work we show in
terms of our above results that uniform tachyon rolling in cosmology can automatically
create and radiate particles at late times after ination with no need of assistant elds
The tachyon produces Hawking-like radiation at the Hagedorn temperature which is high
in the early universe and cools down as the universe expands This is supported by the
perturbative analysis that indicates analogous behaviours in late-time tachyon cosmology
and in a dS universe
The paper is organised as follows In Section 2 we extend our previous suggestion
that the infalling process towards a non-extreme black hole is essentially a tachyon con-
densation process Based on the point we argue that the Hawking radiation from black
hole can be interpreted as thermal radiation from the infalling probe which can be viewed
as an unstable D-particle We shall discuss their implications to tachyon cosmology in
Section 4 in assistance with the perturbative analysis given in Section 5 In the last
section the conclusions are made In the Appendix we present the results about thermal
radiation from rolling tachyon in BCFT and rederive them in the eective eld theory
2 The infalling process and tachyon condensation
In 8 we have shown that the dynamics of an infalling D-particle or point-like object
in the near-horizon region Rindler space of a non-extreme black hole can be described
by the tachyon eective theory ie the probe D-particle in Rindler space behaves as
an unstable D-particle For an infalling particle of mass 0 towards the horizon it can
be described by the tachyon eective action at large T
where e0  0 with  a constant can be viewed as the mass of the unstable particle
This approach to yield an unstable D-particle conguration is similar to the method of
constructing geometrical tachyon in 29 30 where it was found that a prob D-brane on
the geometry of wrapped NS5-branes behaves as an unstable D-brane In what follows
we shall represent and extend the results

21 Asymptotic region
Let us rst extend to the asymptotic region of a non-extreme black hole satisfying asymp-
totically at boundary condition In this region the geometry is nearly the Minkowski
spacetime It is easy to know that the dynamics of a probe on it can be described by the
tachyon eective action 1 sitting on the top of the potential

22 Geometric tachyon in Rindler space
For non-extreme black holes the geometry near the event horizon is generically the Rindler
space To describe the Rindler metric let us start with the two-dimensional Minkowski
spacetime as usual
1 Right wedge In terms of the trajectory of a uniformly accelerating observer we
ds  du2  dv2
do the following reparameterisations for the new spatial coordinate T  0
eT sinht
eT cosht
so that v  0 For T  0 this is the trajectory of a uniformly accelerating observer with
the acceleration of  Note that the transformations here are a little bit dierent from
those given in standard textbooks For later convenience we have chosen an overall factor
2 instead of 1 and a minus sign in the exponential function But this does not make severe
physical dierence
Under the transformations 4 we get the Rindler metric of the form on the right
RR  4e2T dt2  dT 2
In regions closed to the event horizon the coordinate T is large The action S0 of a
particle moving on the right Rindler wedge 5 is actually the eective action ST  1 at
large positive T
S0  20Z dteTp1  T 2  Scid0T  1cid1 
Now the coordinate T nds the meaning of a scalar eld in the action
In this wedge the time t evolves from  to  For large and constant T  the
trajectories at large t are the curves that are very closed to the null ones u  v where
the horizons are located In the tachyon eld theory 6 the null curves correspond to
the solutions at t   and T  
T  1
2 Left wedge The reparameterisations on the T  0 side are given by
u  
eT sinht
v  
eT cosht
so that it covers the v  0 part of the full Minkowski space These lead to the left Rinlder
LR  4e2T dt2  dT 2
The particle in this wedge with large T is described by the eective action 1 on the
negative T side
S0  20Z dteTp1  T 2  Scid0T  1cid1 
In this wedge we can assume that the time evolves from  to  The trajectories for
large and constant T are also those in the neighborhood of the null curves u  v but
on the opposite side
The Rindler space can also be expressed as
R  2dt2 
2 d2
It has two branches   0 and   0 with the horizon located at   0 The coordinates
can be related to those in 5 and 8 via the relations
T  
lncid16
2cid17 
Thus towards the horizon   0 T   respectively
However the region in between the spatial innity and the near-horizon Rindler wedges
may not be described by the tachyon eective action 1 But this intermediate stage is
usually physically unimportant
For extremal black holes the near-horizon geometry is AdS space instead of Rindler
space So the action of a probe particle does not take the form of the tachyon eective
action The infalling process should not be a tachyon condensation process
23 Example
We can take a look at a simple and well-studied example the Schwarzschild black hole
ds2  cid161 
rcid17 d2 cid161 
rcid171
dr2  r2d2
where r0  2M We redene the coordinates
r  r01  2   2r0t
so that  is dimensionless So the rst two components of the metric are
2  42r2
0cid18
1  2 dt2 
1  2
2 d2cid19 
Note that we now have two branches   0 and   0 or T  0 and T  0 respectively
as will be redened later even though r is single valued
At r   or    it is nearly at spacetime We may formally translate the
radial coordinate T  22  c by a constant c   so that T  0 as   
correspondingly So the action of a particle with mass 0 moving along the radial direction
of the metric 14 at spatial innity is actually the the tachyon eective action ST  1
on the top of the potential
S0    2r00Z dtp1  T 2  2r0ST  0
The factor   2r0 appears because ST  is dened in the time coordinate t in stead of
the original  as present in Eq 13 The mass of the particle measured in  is 0 while
it is 2r00 measured in t
Approaching the horizon r  r0 or   0 it is the Rindler space
The particle moving in the right and left Rinlder wedges are respectively
2  42r2
0cid182dt2 
2 d2cid19 
S0  0  2r0ST  
S0  0  2r0ST  
via the redenition relation 11 Thus an ordinary particle in Rindler space can be
viewed as an unstable particle
In summary the infalling process can be correlated with the tachyon condensation
process as presented in Table 1 The tachyon eld theory on the top of the potential is
located at the false vacuum which is the open string vacuum Approaching the horizon
corresponds to the closed string vacuum V  0 of the theory with no open strings present
The above analysis can be extended to the extended Kruskal coordinates of Schwarzschild
black holes We can see that it is a tachyon condensation brane decay process collapsing
from the past null innity I to the black hole horizon H while it corresponds to the
inverse process of tachyon condensation brane creation coming out from the white hole
horizon H to the future null innity I  It is interesting to notice that it is a brane
creation and then decay process from H to H ie the evolution of a full S-brane All
these process can happen in either the right or the left region

3 Hawking radiation via tachyon condensation
It is known that particle open-string pairs of thermal distribution can be created at the
critical Hagedorn temperature in tachyon eld theory 1 3 see the Appendix
Since the infalling process of a probe towards a non-extreme black hole is actually
a tachyon condensation process the Hawking radiation from the black hole could be
interpreted as the thermal radiation from rolling tachyon on the unstable particle ie
the infalling probe The source that makes the probe behave as an unstable particle is the
gravitational force of the black hole The energy of radiation from the unstable particle
originally comes from the black hole In what follows we explore connections between
the tachyon eld theory approach and traditional approaches to Hawking radiation from
black holes
31 Unruh eects in Rindler space and in tachyon eld theory
We rst take a look at how the Unruh eect in Rindler space is relevant in the tachyon eld
theory which actually describes an accelerating scalar eld The Unruh eect in Rindler
space is usually analyzed by a probe scalar  of mass ms in some simple discussion ms
is set to be zero the massive case is reviewed in 31 for example
In the at metric 3 the KG equation is
u  2
s  0
whose solutions are plane waves In Minkowski spacetime it is convenient to dene the
positive frequency modes fk based on the solution  This equation is similar to Eq 54
in the Appendix around T  0 in the tachyon eld theory if we ignore quadratic and
higher order terms of T with sechT   1  OT 2
In the Rindler wedges 5 and 8 the KG equations are respectively
cid02
t  2
se2Tcid1   0
as discussed in many references This equation corresponds to Eq 54 at large T in the
tachyon eld theory So the positive frequency modes gL
k from the equation see
eg 31 respectively corresponds to eit and eit from Eq 54 at large T They
have similar asymptotical forms to Eqs 65 and 66 in the tachyon eective theory
k and gR
The expansions of  in terms of the above modes are
akfk  hc Xk
k  ckgR
k  hc
The Bogolubov coecients in the transformations between gL
k and fk can be derived
via the relations 4 and 7 between the coordinates u v and T t by extending the
modes in Rindler wedges to the full Minkowski spacetime But in the tachyon eld
theory as shown in the Appendix the Bogolubov tansformations 67 and 68 are
determined by the Legendre functions from a single continuum equation with a potential
which smoothly connects the two vacua of the theory But the temperatures of the thermal
spectra obtained in the two approaches are the same The Unruh eect in the BCFT has
been discussed in 3
32 Hawking radiation via particle creation from infalling probe
In Hawkings original work 32 thermal radiation from black hole was derived by consid-
ering a Schwarzschild black hole formed from collapsing matter In our above discussion
we have argued that the infalling process of matter which can be taken as a collection
of point-like cells can be viewed as a tachyon condensation process So the Hawking
radiation could be understood as the thermal radiation in the tachyon eld theory
Following Hawkings approach we do not need to consider the white hole horizon We
only consider the collapsing process from I to H which have been argued above to
correspond to the rolling process of tachyon from T  0 to T   For a propagating
scalar through the collapsing system normalise the outgoing modes at I  as out 
eir and then track back in time to I so that we do not need to know the full
analytical solution in all spacetime outside the horizon Here the tortoise coordinate
r is dened as r  r  r0 lnrr0  1 and is approximately r  2r0T near the
horizon With   2r0t in Eq 14 the normalised outgoing mode takes the form
out  ei2r0tT  near the horizon in the Rindler coordinates T t which are dened
in Eqs 13 and 11 This is consistent with the normalised outgoing mode eit 
eitT  given in Eq 65 in the tachyon eld theory where we have argued that this mode
is chosen because it is relevant to the tachyon condensation process but not the inverse
process
When we go back to I we can nd the correlation of the outgoing mode with
the ingoing mode in  eitr at I This correlation gives rise to the Bogolubov
coecient that leads to a Planck spectrum of particle creation The correlation can be
determined in various methods eg the geometric optics approach Here the method
introduced in 33 is more relevant Consider a collapsing thin shell with light rays
propagating through it during the collapsing process
In the interior of the shell the
metric is at Outside the shell the metric is the Schwarzschild metric The location of
the shell r  R is determined by the junction condition on the boundary of the shell
When a light ray enter the shell at a distance nitely away from the horizon and then
exit near the horizon R  r0 the correlation and so the Bogolubov coecient between
the modes can be determined which indeed lead to the thermal radiation spectrum of
the background black hole Thus the Hawking radiation is derived by the aid of a probe
Here the situation is similar the Hawking radiation can be derived by the aid of an
infalling probe D-particle As shown in the previous section a probe D-particle in
a non-extreme black hole spacetime will behave as an unstable D-particle in the near-
horizon region Particle pairs of thermal distribution at the Hagedorn temperature will
be created from the probe during the collapsing process ie the tachyon condensation
process see the Appendix This should be essentially the Hawking radiation of the
black hole itself
So the tachyon eld theory approach to deriving Hawking radiation is compatible with
previous approaches The derived temperatures in these ways are the same From this
point of view the Hawking temperature is actually the Hagedorn temperature in the
tachyon eld theory They are equivalent when detected in the same time coordinate
 T t
Detected in the Schwarzschild time coordinate  the temperatures are both 14r0 as
expected due to the coordinate relation 13
This interpretation of Hawking temperature as the Hagedorn temperature means that
the infalling particle will experience a Hagedorn phase transition as discussed in the pre-
vious work 8 It will completely decay into gravitons or more generally closed strings
mainly very massive ones in terms of 7 The emission of massless closed strings ac-
counts for the Hawking radiation Part of them can escape from the near-horizon region
to innity But the massive closed strings can not escape and are left in the black hole
In 8 we have made the estimation that the degenerate states of these emitted closed
strings should account for the entropy increased in the host black hole due to absorption
of the infalling particle The result satises the rst law better for black holes far away
from extremality
Finally we may need to check the back reaction For D-particles in string theory the
mass is m0  1gs Thus for small gs the mass of the particle is very heavy In this case
the particle can deform the vacuum geometry of a black hole strongly on the gravitational
theory side while in the tachyon eld theory the back reaction is relatively weak 4 7
For large gs the situations are reversed on the two sides This implies that we may get
desired results on one side from controllable calculations on the other side
Implications to late-time tachyon cosmology
The above results may have useful implications to tachyon cosmology The tachyon cos-
mological model is a powerful model that can provide a unied description of multi-stage
puzzles in modern cosmology However the reheating mechanism is not well claried 13
In what follows we shall show what clues our above results can provide to this problem
and other aspects in this model
For a at universe the FLRW cosmological metric is
ds2  dt2  at2dx  a2d2  dx
with dtat  d The tachyon cosmological model is described by
S  SHE Z ddxa4V T q1  a2T 2
where V T   3 coshT  and 3 is the tension of the unstable D3-brane This action
includes the eective theory of a uniform tachyon which means that the results in previous
sections for the Minkowski case are probably applicable here But the situation is somehow
dierent in this case the tachyon eld is coupled to gravity This can be tackled by
studying the detailed evolutionary process in the model
From the action we can have the equations
p1  T 2
where the dots and prime respectively denote derivatives with respect to time t and the
eld T 
1  T 2
 3H T  ln V   0
It is known that the evolution of these equations at early stage leads to an inationary
stage driven by the potential V around T  0 The dS universe also has an event horizon
For a general inationary universe which is nearly the dS space with at  eHt there
is an equivalent Gibbons-Hawking temperature arising from the periodic Euclideanised
time coordinate
This means that the perturbations produced from ination are nearly Gaussian
During the inationary stage most energy of the potential V 0 is transformed to
the rapid expansion of the universe However beyond ination the situation should
be changed At late stages the potential quickly evolves into the exponential form
V T   23e2T and the eld solution is simply T  cosnt  t We can analyze the
evolutionary features after ination by rewriting Eq 26 at late times as
T    3H T 1  T 2
For given equation state  6 1 the scale factor evolves as at  t231 So H  t1
ie it decreases with time after ination Thus at late times we still approximately
have the solution T  tanht with  being close to but less than  ie very close to
the solution in at space This means that most energy should be transferred to particle
creation and radiation at late times In this case we can adopt the results obtained in the
previous section as a good approximation here Comparing the action 24 in cosmological
background with the standard eective action 49 in Minkowski spacetime we can read
out the temperature for thermal radiation from the tachyon in cosmology
This temperature cools down as at grows evolving in the same rule as other thermal
components in the expanding universe It should be the scale of the CMB temperature
at the present era This is like the case for a black hole the Hawking or Hagedorn
temperature observed in the t coordinate is redshifted to a small value as detected for an
observer at innity in the  coordinate
Hence in the tachyon cosmology the quantum eects of tachyon can lead to a hot
universe after ination via the particle creation process like what happens near a black
hole In the stringy language open strings are excited and created from the homogeneous
tachyon at the Hagedorn temperature Meanwhile closed strings are formed and radi-
ated The massless closed strings may account for a gravitational background of Gaussian
distribution as can be tested by analysing the tensor perturbations in the next section
The massive closed strings forms the tachyon matter which is a candidate to dark matter
This process to attain a hot universe resembles the tachyonic preheating mechanism
in hybrid ination during the stage before the scalar rolls down to the minimum of the
potential 34
We now compare the the temperature for the inationary relic and the one for radiation
from tachyon at late times As shown in Eq 44  is dimension of mass   Ms2
for bosonic strings and   Ms2 for superstrings During the slow-roll ination we
can work out H  26 tanh2T  As in 13 we can determine that the ination
should end at H   from the slow-roll condition H 2   H Hence the temperature
27 around this moment is comparable to the Hagedorn temperature on the tachyon
dS  T t
This means that the emission of gravitational waves from the tachyon and the absorption
of gravitational waves from the inationary relic by the tachyon should be balanced in
the late-time tachyon cosmology The situation is also similar to the case in a black hole
where the Hagedorn temperature is equal to the Hawking temperature of the black hole
as well
5 Perturbation analysis
In this section we provide some evidences to arguments made in the previous section via
perturbative analysis We shall simply compare the perturbations in late-time tachyon
cosmology with those in a dS universe since the latter has been well studied and has been
proved to deserve thermal features
It is known that the elds and their uctuations in dS universes usually satisfy some
featured equations which lead to Gaussian spectra For example for a scalar  with a
potential V  propagating in the dS universe with the exponential scale factor at  eHt
the perturbative equation is
k cid18k2e2Ht 
V  
H 2cid19 k  0
by separating t x  t  t x where t x  a32Pk kteikx From analysis
on the equation the Gibbons-Hawking temperature 27 can be derived
In what follows we show that the perturbations in late-time tachyon cosmology still
satisfy dynamical equations similar to 31 Of course at early times of tachyon cosmology
we also have the perturbative equations like 31 because the universe is at the tachyon
inationary stage around the top of the potential
1 We rst consider the tachyon eld uctuations in the cosmological background at
late times We separate the tachyon eld as follows T t x  T t   t x
expanding universe the perturbed eld equation at late times is
  2 T  3H1  3 T 2   1  T 2a22  0
As analysed in the previous section we approximately have the tachyon solution T 
tanht at late times which is also the tachyon solution in Minkowski spacetime At
the end of ination and afterwards H will decrease from the value H   So we may
ignore the second term in the square bracket in the equation Doing the expansion
  etPk kteikx we can get the equation at late times
a2 e2t  2 k  0
k  k2
In the tachyon driven cosmology a evolves with time But we can think that it evolves
slowly at late times and it can be viewed as a constant within a short time interval So
its behaviour is very like that in Eq 31

6 Conclusions
In this work we have shown that the infalling process in a non-extreme black hole back-
ground should be a tachyon condensation process Based on it we suggest that the
Hawking radiation from a black hole could be interpreted as the thermal radiation from
rolling tachyon on an infalling probe which behaves as an unstable D-particle near
the black hole The Hawking temperature is actually the Hagedorn temperature in the
tachyon eld theory We further show that the result is useful in tachyon cosmology
The uniform tachyon rolling in cosmology can automatically create thermal particles to
reheat the universe after ination via a mechanism just like the Hawking radiation from
a black hole This also means that the perturbations in tachyon cosmology should be still
Gaussian even at late times including the matter-dominated stage These features may
make the tachyon cosmological model still more interesting

A Thermal particle creation from rolling tachyon
Open-string creation from rolling tachyon at the Hagedorn temperature have been dis-
cussed in the BCFT Here we give a brief introduction to the results and show that
similar thermal radiation in the eective eld theory are expected
A1 BCFT
In BCFT the worldsheet action 20 21 is deformed by the boundary term

where p is the tension of the unstable Dp-brane and 1  i j  p So we get a pressure-
less matter state towards the end of condensation which corresponds to non-relativistic
massive closed strings 22 23
The open-string pair creation is discussed in this theory in the minisuperspace ap-
proximation 1 3 In this approximation we only consider the zero-mode x  t x of
X   X 0 X with the elds x only depending on   Then the action 43 is

where m2t  2e2t for brane decay
The equation 47 can be transformed into the standard Bessel equation So it can be
solved by Bessel functions providing the ingoing modes and Hankel functions providing
the outgoing modes The vacuum with no particles is chosen to be in state in the far
past t   The production rate of open-string pairs by evaluating the Bogolubov
coecients relating the in and out states are found to be a thermal spectrum at the
Hagedorn temperature at late times
The same temperature can also be obtained in the other cases m2t  2e2t and
m2t   cosh2t
This temperature essentially arises from the periodicity of the Euclideanised time
It is easy to notice that the equation 47 is invariant
coordinate it  it  2
under the periodic translation of the Euclideanised time
The Hagedorn temperature implies that the energy of tachyon will transfer to closed
string emission as discussed in the BCFT in 6 7 The results indicate that unstable
D-particle or wrapped Dp-branes will decay into closed strings mainly very massive ones
towards the end of tachyon condensation This leads to remarkable speculations for
understanding the fate of a particle collapsing into a non-extremal black hole as will be
revealed later But we will not talk much about this point in this work
A2 Eective eld theory
The tachyon eective theory is believed to be equivalent to the BCFT 24 7 23 particu-
larly at late times Thus it is expected that the same features about string creation and
radiation from tachyon obtained in BCFT should be reproduced in this eective theory
In what follows we show that there should be a similar thermal spectrum of open-string
pair creation at Hagedorn temperature in this theory
The tachyon eective theory 25 26 for an unstable Dp-brane in homogeneous case is

coshT 
The potential tends to vanish as T  
At late time as the tachyon grows large the potential is V T   2peT with T 
t  const If there is no energy loss from the rolling tachyon the energy density should
be constant So the energy-momentum tensor is derived
p1  T 2
 E Tij  
where E is a constant Thus the components evolve as those given in Eq 45 in BCFT
We get a tachyon matter state eventually as well
The rst equation in Eq 51 says that the speed  T of tachyon is accelerating from
0 to the speed 1 of light with the acceleration T  4 2
p E2e2T at late times It is
known that particles can radiated from accelerating objects due to the Unruh eect We
now consider the open-string creation process in this eective theory
From the expression of T00 the equation of motion can be expressed as
This equation can be derived from the vanishing of the Hamiltonian2 as follows
T 2  1 
E2 V 2
2cid18p2
with T  HpT  pT and pT  HT 
T  1 
Similarly we have the KG equation from H  0

The 1 can be viewed as the normalised given by 2
t eitT  Once the tachyon rolls
down o the top of the potential it can evolve in two parallel and symmetric worlds
T  0 and T  0 For later purposes we choose the time direction to be t   on the
positive T side and to be t   on the negative side Since the tachyon eld theory
49 can be a theory in Minkowski spacetime we can dene the positive frequency modes

In the following discussion we omit the time-dependent part of the modes
2This is actually not the Hamiltonian density of the tachyon eective theory in the homogeneous case
which is given by T00 in Eq 51
This equation is the Legendre equation with the transformation z  tanhT  Here
we follow the treatments in 28 with the transformations z  i sinhT  and  
pcoshT   Then the equation becomes the Legendre equation

From solutions to Eq 51 it is known that the tachyon eld T   as t  
so that  T  1 We rst consider the positive T side on which the time is directed to
 As t   there are two possible solutions The solution T  1 corresponds to the
tachyon condensation brane decay process while the one T  1 corresponds to the
inverse tachyon condensation brane creation process since the tachyon decreases with
time growing So these are two dierent evolving channels For the former the solution
T  t  const means that the positive frequency outgoing modes should take the form
eit  eith
  For the latter the solution reads T  t  const and the mode is
eitemh
 Similarly we can get the similar result for eit as the time t   on
the negative T side For the tachyon condensation process eit  eitemh
Here the tachyon condensation process is concerned Since the frequency is taken as
unit in Eq 54 from the relation aa  bb  1 we get the particle numbers at T  
seen in the open string vacuum 0 
n1  b2 
e1TH  1
with TH  2 being the Hagedorn temperature given in Eq 48
Similarly the temperature can be viewed as arising from the periodic translation of
the imaginary eld iT  iT  2 though this periodicity is not on the time coor-
dinate but T  t at late times The equation 54 is invariant under this translational
symmetry
