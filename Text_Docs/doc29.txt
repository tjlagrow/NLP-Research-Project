Abstract 
Unstable angina is common clinical manifestation of atherosclerosis However the 
detailed pathogenesis of unstable angina is still not known Here I propose that 
unstable angina is a mixed TH17 and TH1 immune disorder By using microarray 
analysis I find out that TH1 and TH17 related cytokine cytokine receptor 
chemokines complement immune-related transcription factors anti-bacterial genes 
Toll-like receptors and heat shock proteins are all up-regulated in peripheral 
leukocytes of unstable angina In addition H-ATPase glycolytic genes platelet and 
RBC related genes are also up-regulated in peripheral leukocytes of during unstable 
angina It also implies that atherosclerosis is a mixed TH17 and TH1 autoimmune 
disease If we know the etiology of unstable angina as well as atherosclerosis better 
we can have better methods to control and prevent this detrimental illness 
Introduction 
Atherosclerosis is a very popular disease especially in developed countries It is the 
top death-causing disease in industrial countries Coronary artery disease CAD is 
the most important clinical symptom of atherosclerosis Typical angina and unstable 
angina are common manifestations of CAD Atherosclerosis is thought to be an 
inflammatory disorder However the detailed pathogenesis of angina is not known 
Here I use microarray analysis of peripheral leukocytes to describe unstable angina is 
a mixed TH1 and TH17 immune disorder   
Materials and methods 
Study samples 
I use microarray dataset from Gene Omnibus website GEO The dataset serial 
number is GSE This dataset includes peripheral leukocytes from patients of acute 
myocardial infarction and unstable angina Here I compare the RNA expression 
profile of leukocytes from unstable angina patients to that from health normal 
control This dataset is GSE29111 from Dr Milo and Rothmans study group The 
healthy normal controls are from dataset of a Huntingtons disease blood biomarker 
study population The dataset is GSE8762 from Dr Runne Hs study group This 
second study was published in PNAS2007 1043614424 
RMA normalization 
Affymetrix HG-U133A 20 genechip was used in both samples RMA express 
softwareUC Berkeley Board Institute is used to do normalization and to rule out the 
outliners of the above dataset I rule out the potential outliners of samples due to 
the following criteria   
1 Remove samples which have strong deviation in NUSE plot 
2 Remove samples which have broad spectrum in RLE value plot 
3 Remove samples which have strong deviation in RLE-NUSE mutiplot 
4 Remove samples which exceed 99 line in RLE-NUSE T2 plot 
By the exclusion criteria above I removed GSM721017 from unstable angina samples 
and GSM217774 from healthy normal controls Then Genespring XI software was 
done to analysis the significant expressed genes between ARDS and healthy control 
leukocytes P value cut-off point is less than 005 Fold change cut-off point is 20 
fold change Benjamini-hochberg corrected false discovery rate was used during the 
analysis Totally a genelist of 6020 genes was generated from the HGU133A20 chip 
with 18400 transcripts including 14500 well-characterized human genes 
Results 
Toll-like receptor up-regulation in unstable angina 
During the microarray analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes of unstable angina 
patients I find out that Toll-like receptor genes are up-regulatedTable1 These 
genes include TLR 12468 TIRAP TTRAP TRAF6 TANK TICAM2 and TOLIP It is 
worth noting that TLR1 is 7 fold up-regulated TLR4 is 13 fold up-regulated TLR8 is 6 
fold up-regulated and TANK is 6 fold up-regulated Since TLR 12468 are related to 
the activation of antibacterial TH1 or TH17TH22 immunity we can say that 
TH1anti-intracellular bacteria or TH17TH22anti-extracellular bacteria immunity 
is triggered during unstable angina 
Heat shock protein up-regulation in unstable angina 
In the peripheral leukocyte of unstable angina patients mRNAs of many heat shock 
proteins are up-regulated These genes include HSPA6 HSPA1AA1B HSPA13 
HSPB11 DNAJA4 DNAJB9 DNAJB2 DNAJB4 DNAJC6 DNAJA2 DNAJC27 DNAJC3 
and DNAJC25 Table2 Among them HSPA1AHSPA1B is 56 fold up-regulated and 
DNAJC6 is 48 fold up-regulated However few certain heat shock protein genes are 
down-regulated including HSP90AA1 DNAJC1 DNAJC2 DNAJC3 and DNAJC7 In 
addition these genes are only 2-3 fold down-regulated HSP70 can bind to TLRs to 
initiate anti-bacterial immunity Thus anti-bacterial TH1 or TH17TH22 is likely to be 
activated at unstable angina 
TH1 and TH17 related transcription factor up-regulation during unstable angina 
Then we will look at TH1 and TH22TH17 related transcription factor regulation 
during unstable anginaTable 3 TH1 related transcription factors STAT1 ETS2 RARA 
RXRA IRF2 MNDA MYADM IDO1 and MMD are up-regulated during unstable 
angina Up-regulated TH17 related transcription factors include SMAD1 SMAD4 
SMAD2 SMAD5 SMAD7 RARA RXRA STAT5B SOCS3 IKZF3 FOSL2 and FOXO3 
Besides negative regulator of TH17 immunity ETS1 is down-regulated in unstable 
angina In addition TH related transcription factors are down-regulated including 
MAFB suppressor of IKKe and BCL6 STAT1 is the key downstream mediator of IFNg 
ETS2 can up-regulate IL-12 production Retinoic acid for RXRA and RARA can 
promote TH1 and TH17 immunity IRF2 can promote TH1 immunity via IFNg IDO is 
the downstream mediator of IFNg MNDA MYADM and MMD are all macrophage 
differentiation factors SMADs and STAT5B are downstream mediators of TGFb a key 
cytokine of TH17 immunity SOCS3 IKZF3 FOSL2 and FOXO3 can all promote TH17 
immunity   
TH1 and TH17 related chemokine up-regulation during unstable angina 
In this microarray analysis we can see many chemokine genes are up-regulated 
during unstable angina Table 4 Most important of all majority of these chemokine 
genes are TH1 and TH17 related chemokines The up-regulated chemokine as well as 
chemokine receptors include CXCL1 CCR1 CXCL6 CCR2 CCR6 CCR3 DARC CCL23 
CCRL2 CXCR7 CXCL5 CKLF IL8RB IL8RA IL8 S100A11 S100B S100A9 S100P and 
S100A12 Among these genes CXCL1 is 8 fold up-regulated CCR3 is 18 fold 
up-regulated CXCL5 is 8 fold up-regulated IL8RB is 38 fold up-regulated and S100P 
is 50 fold up-regulated TH1 related chemokine or chemokine receptors include CCR1 
CCR2 CCR6 CCR3 CCL23 and CXCR7 TH17 related chemokine or chemokine 
receptors include CXCL1 CXCL6 CXCL5 IL8RB IL8RA IL8 and S100 proteins   
TH1 and TH17 related prostaglandin and leukotriene during unstable angina 
In peripheral leukocytes of unstable angina patients many prostaglandin and 
leukotriene genes are up-regulated Table 5 These up-regulated genes include 
HPGD PTGS1 PTGS2 LTB4R ALOX5AP ALOX5 ALOX12 PLA2G12A and PLAA 
Prostaglandin and leukotriene B4 are mainly neutrophil chemoattractants Thus 
up-regulation of these genes suggests that TH17 related chemotaxis is up-regulated 
during unstable angina   
TH1 and TH17 related cytokine up-regulation in unstable angina 
During unstable angina many TH1 and TH17 related cytokines are up-regulated 
Table 6 Up-regulated TH1 cytokines include TGFA IL-18IFNG inducing factor and 
IFNG Up-regulated TH17 related cytokines include IL-8 and IL-1B It is worth noting 
that IL1B is 11 fold up-regulated Down-regulated cytokines in unstable angina 
include IL-34 IL-23A IL-32 and TGFB1 It is important to know that IL1 beta is the 
key cytokine in TH17 TH22 anti-extracellular bacteria immunity IFN gamma is the 
key enzyme in TH1 anti-intracellular bacteria immunity Thus both TH17 and TH1 
immunity are up-regulated during unstable angina 
TH1 and TH17 related cytokine receptor expression in unstable angina 
In this microarray study I find out that many cytokine receptor gene expressions are 
changed during unstable angina Table 7 Up-regulated cytokine is usually 
accompanying with down-regulated its cytokine receptor in certain specific 
immunological pathway Down-regulation of IL-6 receptor IL-6ST implies that TH17 
immunological pathway is activated Down-regulation of IFNg receptor implies that 
TH1 immunological pathway is also activated Up-regulation of IL-13 and IL-5 
receptors suggest that TH2 immunological pathway is not activated Up-regulation of 
IL-10 and type 1 interferon receptors suggests that TH immunological pathway is 
not activated Significant up-regulation of IL-1 receptors suggests that TH22 
immunological pathway is not activated And up-regulation of TGFB1 receptor 
suggests that Treg pathway is not activated   
Anti-bacterial complement up-regulation during unstable angina 
Complements are important for anti-bacterial innate immunity including TH1 and 
TH17 immunity Here we show that majority of complement genes are up-regulated 
during unstable angina Table 8 These complement genes include CD59 CD55 CFD 
C4BPA CR1 C4AB CD46 C1QBP ITGAX C1RL C5AR1 and CR11L The only 
down-regulated complement gene is C1QA It means that the whole complement 
machinery is up-regulated during unstable angina 
Other anti-bacterial related gene up-regulation in unstable angina 
In table 9 many other important anti-bacterial genes are up-regulated during 
unstable angina These genes include CSF3R FPR1 CSF2RB SCARF1 CSF2RA DEFA4 
NCF4 NCF2 FPR2 MRC2 DEFB106A and PTX3 It is worth noting that CSF2RB is 10 
fold up-regulated DEFA4 is 11 fold up-regulated and FPR2 is 38 fold up-regulated 
These neutrophil or anti-bacterial related genes suggest the activation of TH1 and 
TH17 host immunological pathways in unstable angina 
Glycolytic genes up-regulation during unstable angina 
In table 10 the whole set of glycolytic pathway is up-regulated in unstable angina 
Hypoxia can drive the activation of the anaerobic glycolysis Thus it is reasonable 
that glycolytic enzymes are up-regulated during the hypoxia status of the attack of 
unstable angina These up-regulated genes include PGK1 PFKFB3 HK2 PYGL BPGM 
PDK3 PFKFB2 GAPDH ENO1 PDK2 PDK4 PGK1 and PFKFB4 It is worth noting that 
BPGM23-bisphosphoglycerate mutase is 19 fold up-regulated The product of 
BPGM is 23-bisphosphoglycerate which combines with hemoglobin can cause a 
decrease in affinity for oxygen Thus the presence of 23-bisphosphoglycerate helps 
oxyhemoglobin to unload oxygen to help unstable angina patients   
H-ATPase gene up-regulation during unstable angina 
In table 11 we can see many H-ATPases are up-regulated during unstable angina 
These genes include ATP6V0B ATP6V0C ATP6V1B2 ATP6V0E1 ATP6AP2 ATP6V1A 
ATP6V1C1 ATP6V0A2 and ATP6V1D These ATPases are proton pumps which can 
generate H by using ATP In addition several carbonic anhydrases are also 
up-regulated including CA1 CA2 and CA4 Carbonic anhydrases can catalyze H2CO3 
formation from CO2 and H2O Thus acidosis can result during the attack of unstable 
angina   
Coagulation gene up-regulation during unstable angina 
In table 12 majority of coagulation related genes are up-regulated in peripheral 
leukocytes of unstable angina patients These genes include THBS1 VWF THBD F2R 
F5 F8 F2RL1 ITGA2B PROS1 GP5 PTAFR PLAUR TFP1 ITGB3 PDGFD HPSE GP6 
PEAR1 and TBXAS1 Only few coagulation related genes are down-regulated 
including GP1BB and CD36 Most important of all F2RL1 is 18 fold up-regulated   
RBC related genes are up-regulated during unstable angina 
In table 13 majority of RBC related genes are up-regulated during unstable angina 
These up-regulated genes include EPB41 GYPE ANK1 HPHPP NFE2 ALAS2 GYPA 
HBG1HBG2 EPOR RHCERHD ANKRD12 GYPB HEBP1 ERAF HBQ1 AK2RIN2 
ANKRDS2 HEMGN ANKRD50 HBM and HBD A few genes are down-regulated 
including HMOX1 and ANKRD10 It is worth noting that many hemoglobin genes are 
up-regulated including HBG1 HBG2 HBQ1 HBM and HBD Among them HBG12 is 
20 fold up-regulated HBM is 60 fold up-regulated HEMGN is 49 fold up-regulated 
HBQ1 is 18 fold up-regulated ERAF is 33 fold up-regulated GYPA is 27 fold 
up-regulated and ALAS2 is 36 fold up-regulated Heme oxygenase HMOX1 can 
degrade heme and it is down-regulated in unstable angina   
Discussion 
Atherosclerosis is a very common and detrimental disease especially in many 
developed countries It is usually among the top three leading causes of mortality 
Inflammatory process is thought to be related to the etiology of atherosclerosis C 
reactive protein CRP is found to be related to the course of atherosclerosis 
Abnormal T cell activation has been found in atherosclerosisLiuzzo Kopecky et al 
1999 However detailed relationship between inflammation and atherosclerosis is 
remained to be unlocked Unstable angina is a clinical manifested syndrome of 
atherosclerosis Thus I use microarray analysis of peripheral leukocytes to study the 
relationship of specific inflammation and unstable angina   
Host immunity against bacteria includes TH1anti-intracellular bacteria and 
TH17anti-extracellular bacteria It is observed that Chlamydia pneumonia is noted 
in endothelium of atherosclerosis lesionBenagiano Azzurri et al 2003 Benagiano 
Munari et al 2012 Thus immunity against intracellular bacteria is likely to be 
activated in atherosclerosis In addition Helicobacter pylori infection is also related 
to atherosclerosis Thus anti-extracellular TH17 immunity is also likely to be 
activated during atherosclerosisNg Burris et al 2011 In addition TH1 and TH17 
immunological pathways are also related to important risk factors for atherosclerosis 
Diabetes mellitus and hypertensionGao Jiang et al 2010 Xie Wang et al 2010 In 
addition CRP the TH17 inflammatory factor is elevated in atherosclerosis 
Macrophage the main TH1 effector cell is accumulated in atherosclerotic 
plaquesLaurat Poirier et al 2001 In addition deficiency of Treg cells promotes the 
progression of atherosclerosisGotsman Grabie et al 2006 Mor Planer et al 2007 
Besides TH2 and TH immunological pathway activation such as IL-10 
up-regulation can reduce the development of atherosclerosisLiuzzo Kopecky et al 
1999 Pinderski 2002 These evidences all suggest that TH1 and TH17 immunity plays 
an important role in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis   
In this study I find out the evidences that immunity plays a very important role in the 
pathogenesis of unstable angina First of all anti-bacterial Toll-like receptors are 
up-regulated during unstable angina These Toll-like receptors include TLR 12468 
It is worth noting that TLR 1246 are for triggering anti-extracellular bacteria TH17 
immunity TLR8 is for triggering anti-intracellular bacteria TH1 immunity Thus both 
TH1 and TH17 immunity are initiated during unstable angina   
In addition heat shock proteins which are responsible for triggering anti-bacterial 
immunity are also up-regulated during unstable angina attack Heat shock protein 70 
HSP70 can bind to Toll-like receptor 2 and Toll-like receptor 4 to trigger TH17 
immunity In this study I find out that HSP70 genes are up-regulated including 
HSPA1A HSPA6 and HSPA13 This means anti-bacterial immunity is activated during 
unstable angina   
Then we look at immune-related transcription factor expression in unstable angina 
Strikingly we find out many TH1 and TH17 related immune transcription factor 
up-regulation in unstable angina patients peripheral leukocytes STAT1 is the key 
downstream transcription factor of TH1 immunity The key TH1 cytokine IFN gamma 
can mediate its function mainly by activating STAT1 In addition STAT5B and SMAD 
proteins are major effector genes of TGF beta signaling TGF beta is the key cytokine 
to initiate TH17 immunity Thus both TH1 and TH17 are likely to be activated during 
unstable angina In addition TH17 negative regulator ETS1 is down-regulated in 
unstable anginaMoisan Grenningloh et al 2007 Retinoic acid related transcription 
factors which promote TH1 and TH17 immunity are up-regulated during unstable 
anginaMucida Park et al 2007 AiolosIKZF3 which can activate TH17 immunity is 
also up-regulated in unstable anginaQuintana Jin et al 2012   
Chemokine genes are differentially regulated in unstable angina Most important of 
all TH17 and TH1 related chemokine and chemokine receptor genes are 
up-regulated These strikingly up-regulated chemokine related genes include CXCL1 
CCR3 CXCL5 IL8RB and S100P CCR3 is TH1 immunity related chemokine receptor 
CXCL1 CXCL5 and S100P are TH17 immunity related chemokines And IL8RB is TH17 
related chemokine receptor Besides prostaglandin and leukotriene B4 related genes 
are also up-regulated during unstable angina This also shows that TH17 
anti-bacterial immunity is activated at unstable angina 
Then we look at cytokine and cytokine receptor gene expression profiles of 
peripheral leukocytes during unstable angina We find out that IL-18 TGFA IFNG 
IL1B and IL8 are up-regulated Among them IL-18 TGFA and IFNG are key TH1 
related cytokines IL8 and IL1B are key TH17 related cytokines Besides many 
cytokine receptors are also differentially regulated at unstable angina These 
up-regulated cytokine receptors include IL-1R IL-13R IL-5R IL10R IFNaR IL1R and 
TGFB1R And down-regulated cytokine receptors are IL6ST and IFNgR Specific 
immunological pathway is usually associated with down-regulation of its effector 
cytokine receptors Thus TH1 activation is related to interferon gamma receptor 
down-regulation and TH17 activation is related to interleukin 6 receptor 
down-regulation In addition TH2 TH Treg and TH22 immune pathways are not 
triggered These results also support my hypothesis   
Complements are important in mediating host killing of intracellular bacteria as well 
as extracellular bacteria In this study we can see that majority of complement 
machinery is activated including CD59 CD55 CFD C4BPA CR1 C4AB CD46 C1QBP 
ITGAX C1RL C5AR1 and CR11L This means anti-bacterial TH1 or TH17 immunity is 
triggered during unstable angina Besides other important anti-bacterial host 
defense genes are also up-regulated These up-regulated anti-bacterial genes include 
CSF3R FPR1 CSF2RB SCARF1 CSF2RA DEFA4 NCF4 NCF2 FPR2 MRC2 DEFB106A 
and PTX3 These genes include neutrophil and macrophage growth factors pattern 
recognition receptor defensin neutrophil cytosolic factors and pentraxin These all 
suggest that TH1 or TH17 anti-bacterial immunity is activated during unstable angina 
By using microarray analysis we can also understand the complications of unstable 
angina Glycolysis acidosis hypoxia and coagulation anomaly are frequently 
reported in unstable angina First of all we look at the glycolytic mediating enzymes 
in unstable angina Strikingly we find out all glycolytic enzyme genes are 
up-regulated including PGK1 PFKFB3 HK2 PYGL BPGM PDK3 PFKFB2 GAPDH 
ENO1 PDK2 PDK4 PGK1 and PFKFB4 Among them BPGM is 19 fold up-regulated 
BPGM can help to unload oxygen from oxy-hemoglobins Thus it can help to alleviate 
the hypoxic syndrome during unstable angina It can be explained as a host 
compensatory mechanism responding to the attack of unstable angina More we 
find out that many ATPase genes are up-regulated during unstable angina including 
ATP6V0B ATP6V0C ATP6V1B2 ATP6V0E1 ATP6AP2 ATP6V1A ATP6V1C1 ATP6V0A2 
and ATP6V1D Several carbonic anhydrase enzyme genes are also up-regulated 
including CA1 CA2 and CA4 In my previous malaria genomic research I find out a 
co-expression of glycolytic enzymes and ATPases Here I also find out acidosis at 
unstable angina can be due to up-regulation of these proton pumps H-ATPase and 
H2CO3 producing carbonic anhydrases   
Finally we look at RBC and platelet related gene expression profiles during unstable 
angina Strikingly we find out that majority of RBC and platelet related genes are 
up-regulated during unstable angina Up-regulated plateletcoagulation related 
genes include THBS1 VWF THBD F2R F5 F8 F2RL1 ITGA2B PROS1 GP5 PTAFR 
PLAUR TFP1 ITGB3 PDGFD HPSE GP6 PEAR1 and TBXAS1 Platelet function is 
triggering blood coagulation and overactivation of coagulation related genes can be 
related to the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis induced unstable angina with 
coronary artery occlusion Up-regulated RBC related genes include EPB41 GYPE 
ANK1 HPHPP NFE2 ALAS2 GYPA HBG1HBG2 EPOR RHCERHD ANKRD12 GYPB 
HEBP1 ERAF HBQ1 AK2RIN2 ANKRDS2 HEMGN ANKRD50 HBM and HBD We can 
see many hemoglobin genes are up-regulated at unstable angina Unstable angina is 
caused by lack of oxygen support for cardiac muscle Thus up-regulated RBC related 
genes including hemoglobin genes can help to alleviate the hypoxia status during 
unstable angina It can be viewed as a host compensatory mechanism at the attack of 
unstable angina 
In summary microarray analysis of peripheral leukocytes from unstable angina 
patients can help to explain the pathogenesis of unstable angina From the above 
evidences unstable angina can be viewed as a mix TH1 and TH17 inflammatory 
disorder with up-regulated TH1TH17 chemokines cytokines transcription factors 
Toll-like receptors heat shock proteins complements leukotrienes prostaglandins 
defensins pentraxins and other effector molecules In addition overactivation of 
platelet related genes glycolytic enzymes and H-ATPases can help to explain the 
pathophysiology of unstable angina with coagulation hyperactivity and metabolic 
acidosis Finally up-regulation of RBC related genes should be a host compensatory 
mechanism to increase oxygen delivery during unstable angina
