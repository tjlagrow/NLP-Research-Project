ABSTRACT
I review the subject of the cosmological evolution of galaxies including dif-
ferent aspects of growth in disk galaxies by focussing on the angular momentum
I discuss the alternative to merger-
problem mergers and their by-products
driven growth  cold accretion and related issues
In the follow-up I review
possible feedback mechanisms and their role in galaxy evolution Special at-
tention is paid to high-redshift galaxies and their properties In the next step
I discuss a number of processes gas- and stellar-dynamical within the central
kiloparsec of disk galaxies and their eect on the larger spatial scales as well as
on the formation and fuelling of the seed black holes in galactic centres at high
redshifts
Introduction the paradigm of galaxy evolution
The aim of these lectures is to review the main aspects of secular galaxy evolution ie
galaxy evolution on cosmological scales Two issues stand out in this attempt First the
subject is immense and cannot be covered within the scope of this chapter And second one
cannot ignore the fact that galaxy evolution is part of the overall evolution in the Universe
 from the largest spatial scales ruled by dark matter DM to the smallest ones taken over
by dissipative baryons that can form stars and grow supermassive black holes SMBHs In
other words the process of galaxy formation can be inuenced strongly by a huge range of
spatial scales Hence our attempt to discuss secular galaxy evolution will be rather modest in
depth only highlighting those issues which appear to lie at the forefront of current research
Lastly we shall focus on disk galaxy evolution and only briey mention elliptical galaxies
Galactic morphology is largely a reection of underlying dynamical and secular processes
on relevant scales That morphological evolution does indeed take place has been established
fairly well eg a recent quantitative analysis comparing galaxy populations at redshifts
z  06 and z  0 Delgado-Serrano et al 2010 While the fraction of ellipticals has barely
changed over the last 5 Gyr the fraction of peculiar galaxies grew in favour of spirals by a
 2 
factor of 23 So peculiar morphology increases dramatically with z eg Brinchmann 
Ellis 2000
As the galaxy population does indeed exhibit evolutionary trends the question is what
drives this process and how can we analyse and quantify it Overall our goal lies in ex-
plaining the origin of the contemporary Hubble sequence and in describing changes in this
sequence over z
In this context two alternative views exist Firstly the Hubble fork is
determined by the initial conditions ie by Nature That means for example that the
massive galaxies form in the highest overdensities which themselves resulted from initial
conditions Alternatively it is the environment ie Nurture not Nature that determines
the galaxy properties Within this framework evolution is driven solely by interactions eg
between galaxies between galaxies and the intergalactic medium IGM etc
In the past couple of decades the issue of structure formation in the Universe in terms
of the dichotomy of top-to-bottom versus bottom-up scenarios has been resolved in favour
of the latter and of the cold dark matter CDM paradigm Unfortunately even within the
bottom-up framework it remains unclear when and where the baryons matter Clearly on
large scales the baryons follow the DM But where and when do the baryons run amok1
Inside the DM haloes In the cold laments As the baryons collapse into the haloes where
do stars form  in disks or spheroids Is gas fragmentation encouraged or suppressed during
this infall To what degree is the angular momentum conserved during collapse
These questions open a Pandoras box of dissipative baryon dynamics partially decou-
pled from the DM They underline pressing problems of structure formation on galactic and
subgalactic scales Most importantly they emphasise the oldnew dichotomy of what is pri-
marily responsible for disk evolution internal or external factors Keeping this in mind it
is possible to construct a follow-up list of outstanding problems according to anyones taste
Why do disks form inside triaxial haloes The haloes appear universally triaxial in numer-
ical simulations eg review by Shlosman 2008 What is the prevailing morphology of the
early galaxies disk elliptical or some other unspecied morphology Can archaeology help
to uncover the details of disk formation and evolution Important issues here are can disks
survive the epoch of major mergers and do geometrically thick disks come from mergers or
from supernova SN feedback
A separate set of problems is related to disk-halo dynamical and secular interactions
which can have profound eects on both components  a kind of a dynamical feedback To
what extent does the disk evolution at high z dier from that at low z What is the origin of
bulges and galactic bars And what does this tell us about internally versus externally-driven

disk evolution
Beyond star formation what is the role of baryons in disk evolution What are the
dynamical corollaries of gas presence eg in maintaining the disk spiral structure More
specically does the gas and the baryon fraction vary systematically with the halo mass
Mh When do baryons form central SMBHs Does feedback from stellar and SMBH evolu-
tion encourage or suppress further star formation
Finally are disk galaxies doomed in the sense that ultimately they will fall into high-
density regions and what does that tell us about the morphology-density relation at high z
When did the current morphology-density relation form and what regulates star formation
in disks stellar mass loss or cold infall
Much of the theoretical progress understanding the drivers of galaxy evolution is due to
numerical simulations of collisionless and dissipative processes in the Universe Over the last
few decades astronomy has acquired precious support from an experiment albeit a virtual
one Because the dominant processes are so nonlinear the synthesis of theoretical observa-
tional and experimental components has contributed much of our current understanding of
structure formation in the Universe on all spatial scales If our goal is to be able to produce
realistic galaxies that can be directly compared with observations we are well underway
The challenges in understanding galaxy formation and evolution are amplied by the
unknown physics of the dominant processes eg star formation mechanical and radiative
physics turbulence supplemented by often counter-intuitive nonlinear dynamics and by
insucient observational constraints The numerical approach also suers from the large
dynamic range to be addressed by simulations  from 10100 Mpc down to AU Gravity
is the source of this diculty
The cornerstone of the current galaxy formation paradigm was established and rened
in 1970s1990s It has been very successful in predicting and explaining disk galaxy prop-
erties A two-stage process has been suggested based on hierarchical clustering and DM
halo formation in the rst stage and gas cooling and collapse into pre-existing potential
wells in the second one eg White  Rees 1978 Fall  Efstathiou 1980 Mo et al 1998
Prior to gravitational collapse the DM haloes acquire angular momentum J via gravita-
tional torques while baryons follow the DM and have the same specic angular momentum
j  JM In the next step while the DM warms up during virialisation the baryons can
cool down and continue the collapse with j and hence its distribution roughly constant Fi-
nally the low-j baryons accrete onto the inner regions and cause central starbursts resulting
in the formation of galactic bulges in disk galaxies and SMBHs in their centres Meanwhile
high-j baryons form galactic disks with self-regulated star formation In this framework j
 4 
determines the disk size and the disk surface density xes the timescale for star formation
Another milestone has been passed with the understanding that pure DM structure
formation leads to a universal density prole in virialised objects eg Navarro et al 1996
hereafter NFW This density prole has been approximated by a power law with a slope
of 2 in log log R at some characteristic radius Rs It becomes shallower and tends to
a slope of 1 toward the centre and steepens to a slope of 3 at large radii Over a range
of radii the NFW density prole leads to a at circular velocity curve The dissipative
baryon inux into the halo is accompanied by a substantial adiabatic contraction of the
non-dissipative DM in the central region which is being dragged in modifying the mass
distribution there eg Blumenthal et al 1986 The adiabatic contraction of the DM
halo has been invoked in order to explain the conspiracy of so-called maximum disks eg
Burstein  Rubin 1985 However additional processes that may have been omitted in the
original estimate of the adiabatic contraction can complicate this picture quite substantially
eg Primack 2009
This galaxy formation paradigm has received substantial support from both observa-
tions and high-resolution numerical simulations although a long list of caveats exists The
theoretical background for DM mass and angular momentum distributions is still unclear
and remains at the forefront of astrophysical research
In this conjecture the value of the angular momentum its distribution and conservation
emerge as one of the dominant parameters if not the dominant one determining galaxy
evolution along with the halo mass To understand the caveats associated with J we dene
the dimensionless angular momentum parameter which characterises the DM haloes eg
Bullock et al 2001
 
2MhRhv  003  005
where Mh and Rh are the halos virial mass and radius respectively and v is its circular
velocity Numerical simulations point to the universality of the  log-normal distribution

where   0035  0005 is the best-t value and   05 is the width of the log-
normal distribution Equation 1 is a slightly modied version of the original spin parameter 
introduced by Peebles 1969 with  00101 being the range found for DM haloes and its
median  0035 The simple relation between  and  is given by   ESISENFW12
where ESIS and ENFW are the energies of isothermal and NFW haloes
 5 
The collapsing baryons will be stopped by the centrifugal barrier if J is conserved
In the absence of DM   RdRh12 where Rd is the radius of a disk embedded in the
halo To reach rotational support  must increase by a factor of ten to   05 This
means that a collapse will proceed over two decades in R and the resulting RdRh  001
will be uncomfortably small On the other hand baryon collapse within a DM halo leads to
  RdRh This requires only a collapse by a factor of 10 in R in order to be in agreement
with observations resulting in Rd  8 0035H0Hzv200 km s1 kpc eg Mo et al
1998 Here H0 and Hz are the Hubble constants at z  0 and at an arbitrary redshift and
v is the maximum rotational velocity in the disk which is also the halo circular velocity for
maximum disks The corollaries are that eg haloes with higher  lead to lower surface
brightness disks and that the resulting disk size distribution originates in the  distribution
However the observed spread in Rd appears to be larger than the spread in  eg
de Jong  Lacey 2000 Furthermore an analysis of the Courteau 1997 sample of local
massive disks has shown that gas may lose some of its angular momentum Burkert et
al 2009 Comparison of these disks with the half-light radii of z  2 SINS galaxies eg
Forster-Schreiber et al 2009 Cresci et al 2009 reveals a similar deciency of the spin
parameter for the latter We return to this issue in Section 2 While the above discrepancies
must be claried a number of other caveats threatening the current paradigm require much
more serious attention and will be discussed below
2 Disk growth the angular momentum problem
Within the galaxy formation paradigm of White  Rees 1978 and Fall  Efstathiou
1980 the DM haloes acquire their spin from tidal interactions and baryons increase their
rotational support by falling into the potential wells of these haloes and by conserving their
angular momentum To what degree the baryon angular momentum is preserved during this
process has emerged as one of the key issues in our understanding of disk galaxy formation
21 The angular momentum catastrophe
So is there a problem with J when forming galactic disks We start with the so-called
angular momentum catastrophe which has emerged from the comparison of observations
with numerical simulations of disk formation While the observed disks have shown a de-
ciency of specic angular momentum j by a factor of two modelled disks appear to have
radial scalelengths smaller by a factor of 10 compared with observations resembling bulges
 6 
rather than disks eg Navarro  Steinmetz 2000 In other words the actual disks rotate
too fast for a given luminosity L At the same time the slopes of the modelled disks turned
out to be in agreement with the I-band Tully-Fisher TF relation for late-type galaxies
L v
max where  254 increasing to 3 in I In our context this is important because
TF denes the relation between the dynamical mass and L Simulations have shown much
more compact endproducts of baryonic collapse where the gas has lost a substantial fraction
of its j As we shall see below the possible remedy to this problem involves a combination
of numerical and physical factors but no universal solution has been found so far
What are the possible contributors to the angular momentum catastrophe The rst
suspect is lack of numerical resolution Indeed increasing the resolution by adding smooth
particle hydrodynamics SPH particles eg Lucy 1977 Monaghan 1982 has improved the
situation by helping to resolve the maxima of rotation curves resulting in atter and lower
curves thus having an eect on the central and outer regions of modelled galaxies eg
Governato et al 2004 Naab et al 2007 Mayer et al 2008
Numerical non-conservation of j is another suspect
In the outer disks it can cause
an excess of angular momentum transfer to the halo eg Okamoto et al 2005 In the
inner disks this eect could smear the radial gradients of rotation velocity and articially
stabilise the disks against bar instability Modelling an isolated galaxy formed from a non-
cosmological Milky Way-type DM halo has demonstrated that low-resolution disks heat up
and lose j to the halo Colder disks remain larger and have smaller bulge-to-disk ratios A
possible solution lies in the increase of the number of SPH particles and the introduction of
a multi-phase interstellar medium ISM
Next the disk ISM cooling below the Toomre 1964 threshold of Q csG  1 leads
to an excessive fragmentation we return to this problem when discussing over-cooling Here
cs is the sound speed in the gas   the epicyclic frequency and   the disk gas surface
density The multi-phase ISM introduced by Springel  Hernquist 2003 through a modied
equation of state clearly alleviated the problem The gas cooling must be compensated by
some kind of feedback to avoid fragmentation and the follow-up runaway star formation
This feedback from stellar evolution eg from SNe and OB stars has a clear eect on the
bulge-to-disk ratio Robertson et al 2004 Heller et al 2007b
Finally it was pointed out that baryons can hitchhike inside DM halo substructures
which spiral in to the centre as a result of dynamical friction eg Maller  Dekel 2002
This process is similar to that in a disk where in the absence of star formation dense gas
clumps would heat up the disk spiral in to the centre and possibly contribute to the bulge
growth eg Shlosman  Noguchi 1993 Noguchi 1999 Bournaud et al 2007 This process
related to overcooling can be easily over- or underestimated because it depends on a number
 7 
of additional processes eg gas-to-stars conversion ablation etc see Section 61 Also
one cannot neglect the contribution of clumpy DM and baryons to the mechanical feedback
ie by dynamical friction and consequently to the fate of the central DM cusp and the
formation of a at density core in the halo eg El-Zant et al 2001 Tonini et al 2006
Romano-Daz et al 2008a
22 The cosmological spin distribution and individual haloes
We now turn to the distribution of angular momentum in DM haloes Early consider-
ations of the baryon collapse assumed an initial solid-body rotation for uniform-density gas
spheres The angular momentum distribution AMD can be written as M j  Mh1 
1  jjmax32 where jmax is some maximum j if baryons preserve j during this process
which results in exponential disks eg Mestel 1963 More generally what is the shape
of an AMD which leads to exponential disks The initial solid-body rotation law is soon
replaced following assumptions that baryons are mixed well with the DM and share its j
Assuming j conservation Md jMd  Mh jMh where Md is the disk mass eg
Fall  Efstathiou 1980 Bullock et al 2001 Maller  Dekel 2002 the new AMD can be
written as
if j  0
and P j  0 if j  0 This leads to a mass distribution with j
j  j02
P j 
M j  Mh
with two parameters   the shape and j0   1jmax  whose eect on M j has been
displayed in Bullock et al 2001 Fig 4 for four haloes When using the best-t j0 and
normalising by Mh all haloes follow the same curve nicely  an indication of the universality
of the AMD The resulting computed disk surface density is nearly exponential but with
an over-dense core and an overextended tail
Using Swaters 1999 sample of 14 dwarf disk galaxies van den Bosch et al 2001
have demonstrated that the specic AMDs ie M j of these disks dier from halo
AMDs proposed by Bullock et al 2001 But the total disk js ie P  are similar to
those of haloes Although the pre-collapse baryon and DM AMDs are expected to be similar
the disks formed have been found to lack low and high j  in direct contradiction to the
simple theoretical expectations discussed above Moreover the mass fraction of Swaters
disks appears to be signicantly smaller than the universal baryon fraction in a CDM
universe Does this mean that disks form from a small fraction of baryons and in spite of
 8 
this attract most of the available angular momentum One can argue that a redistribution
of baryon j should occur at a stage earlier than anticipated or that the high-j baryons
avoid the disks What processes are responsible for modifying the baryon AMDs As argued
by van den Bosch et al 2001 a plausible explanation can lie in the selective loss of the
low-j gas leading to essentially bulgeless disks
The closely-related issue of the existence of bulgeless disk galaxies is discussed in Sec-
tion 6
23 The tidal torque theory and the origin of the universal angular
momentum distribution
Rotation of galaxies results from gravitational torques near the time of the maximum
expansion eg Hoyle 1949 Doroshkevich 1970 White 1978 If J is calculated using the
spherical shell approximation ie linear tidal torque theory hereafter TTT further redistri-
bution during the non-linear stage contributes little Porciani et al 2002ab Alternatively
J can be acquired in the subsequent non-linear stage of galaxy evolution via mergers ac-
counting for the orbital angular momentum and its redistribution eg Barnes  Efstathiou
According to the TTT J is gained mostly in the linear regime of growing density per-
turbations due to the tidal torques from neighbouring galaxies The maximum contribution
to J comes from the times of the maximum cosmological expansion of the shell Little J is
exchanged in the non-linear regime after the decoupling and virialisation of the DM Baryons
are well mixed with the DM and acquire similar j see Section 1 The TTT follows the
evolution of the angular momentum of the DM halo based on the moment of inertia tensor
and the tidal tensor Within this framework galactic spins can be estimated using the quasi-
linear theory of gravitational instability The TTT has been extensively tested by numerical
simulations
So far we have not considered the eect of the mergers on the evolution of J or  We
dene mergers as major if their mass ratio is larger than 1  3 Wechsler 2001 has argued
that major mergers dominate the j-balance in galaxies Do they The crucial point here
is to account for the redistribution of the angular momentum during and after the merger
Hetznecker  Burkert 2006 have separated the main contributors to  JE12M 52 ie
J E and Mh and followed them during and after the merger event While the DM halo J
experiences a jump during a major merger the subsequent mass and energy redistribution
in the halo washes out the gain in J A similar conclusion has been reached by Romano-Daz

Fig 1 Evolution of DM halo spin  as a function of a the cosmological expansion parameter
during major mergers in three models CE In all frames the blue upper curves show the spin
s within the characteristic NFW radii The red lower curves show the evolution of the spin vir
within the halo virial radii The thick black line has been applied to show the normal evolution
during major mergers from Romano-Daz et al 2007
et al 2007 and is displayed in Fig 1 The corollary of high-resolution DM simulations
is that there is no steady increase in the halo cosmological spin  with time due to major
mergers
To summarise hydrodynamical simulations show that the angular momentum of baryons
is not conserved during their collapse A number of factors can contribute to this process
but there is no denitive answer yet The proposed solutions often amount to ne tuning
There is also a mismatch in the j-proles The distribution of the modelled specic angular
momentum does not agree with the observations
 10 
Fig 2 Disk growth mechanisms involve mergers andor gas accretion Both options depend on
the environment and their eects are gradually quenched in clusters of galaxies The dependence
on redshift is 1  z22 for mergers and seems to have a peak around z  2 but this is yet to be
veried for the gas accretion
3 Disk growth mergers
In this and the following sections we shall review the details of secular and dynamical
growth in disk galaxies which involve merging andor the accretion of cold gas Fig 2
In the simplest unrealistic case of an isolated collapsing cloud the angular momentum
is conserved because the escaping radiation is isotropic and carries little J anyway
possible that some of the gas will rebound and escape in the equatorial plane taking away
some J
The lowest energy state for a rotating self-gravitating cloud occurs when almost all of
the mass is found in the central compact accumulation ie SMBH and a negligible mass
and all of the angular momentum escape to innity Such a state is never achieved however
because the eciency of J-transfer is declines rapidly as the process goes on Amusingly to
quote Colgate  Petschek 1986 there seems to be too much angular momentum in the
Universe to allow the formation of stars  This fundamental problem begs for solution
Since net J appears to be zero over very large scales  our problem is restricted to local
patches of the Universe where matter collapses to form relatively dense rotating objects 
We note that in order to understand how galaxies grow one needs to resolve the issue of
what is the most ecient angular momentum loss mechanism in particular circumstances
 11 
Disk galaxies form inside DM haloes and it seems clear that Natures choice is the
formation of self-gravitating disks rather than a complete and ecient collapse to the very
centre Disks can form slowly from a weakly rotating gas cloud in an adiabatic process and
their properties in this case will be linked to the initial conditions Or they can form on a
short dynamical timescale forgetting the initial conditions in the process In such a process
how much J is transferred to the DM and how much is redistributed among the baryons
What factors aect the secular growth of galactic disks The following list of physi-
cal factors and associated processes was not compiled in order of signicance and are not
mutually exclusive
 Environment determined by highlow density elds and their corollary  supply of
cold gas from laments etc major and minor mergers in the low velocity dispersion
eld interactionsharassment in the high velocity dispersion eld stripping tidal
ram strangulation
 Rate of star formation feedback from stellar evolution and active galactic nucleus
AGN galactic winds
 Intrinsic factors
the host DM halo
local and global gravitational instabilities degree of asymmetry in
In the following we shall discuss some of the above factors but shall avoid going into details
about the internal dynamics of stellar bars see review by Lia Athanassoula this volume and
general aspects of galactic dynamics see review by James Binney this volume This means
that we shall emphasise the external factors driving galaxy evolution and only occasionally
resort to internal factors Two such exceptions involve the physics of the central kiloparsec
and some aspects of the formation of SMBHs Section 8 We note however that this
separation is largely articial and the action of external triggers of galaxy evolution is
frequently associated with excitation of internal degrees of freedom One such well-known
example is the tidal triggering of stellar bars
In order to grow galaxies and their haloes must rely on the exterior reservoir of baryons
and DM respectively These can come in various degrees of virialisation from smooth to
clumpy accretion see Section 5 from carrying nearly unvirialised to fully virialised baryons
and embedded in parent DM haloes The latter lead to mergers of various mass ratios
from major to intermediate to minor The physics of accretion of course diers profoundly
depending on the smoothness of accreting material Mergers can also include stellar and DM
components In the following we are going to discuss the main processes which accompany
merging dynamical friction phase mixing and violent relaxation
 12 
Mergers are a diverse phenomenon and their products are equally diverse We rst
discuss the criterion for merging then merger demographics ie their role in forming and
growing spheroids and gas-rich disks wetdry mergers We follow this up by reviewing
the eect of major mergers on starbursts and AGN and the eect of minor mergers on
disk heating The relationship between mergers and morphology evolution stripping and
briey the origin of ellipticals are discussed next Two questions will be emphasised whether
mergers play an important role in creating spheroids and whether dry mergers move galaxies
along the red sequence
The process of merging can be dened as an encounter of two galaxies which results
in the formation of a single galaxy Based on the mass ratios of the merging objects we
distinguish between major mergers  13 intermediate mergers from 13 to 110 and
minor mergers  110 Mergers in gas-rich systems are highly dissipative and denoted
as wet mergers while mergers in gas-poor systems are dissipationless and dry Finally
mergers can be binary or multiple when more than two galaxies are involved
Mergers are important because their rate grows rapidly with redshift  1zm al-
though the inferred rate exhibits a substantial scatter The dierences come from matching
the rate for rich clusters and for eld galaxies but also because of using dierent methods
such as close pairs and morphology Extending the measure to fainter magnitudes generally
shows an increase in m There is also a dierence between observational and theoretical
estimates Specically m  6 2 in rich clusters eg van Dokkum et al 1999 but it is
much smaller in the eld m  27 06 eg Le Fevre et al 2000 A recent comparison
between optical and near-infrared NIR bands has revealed a substantial dierence in the
major merger rate of m  343 049 and 218 018 respectively Rawat et al 2008 Di-
verse observations have resulted in an overall range of m  2 2 while numerical simulations
result in a narrow range of m 3 although ignoring the possibility of multiple galaxies per
DM halo
The situation is more confusing with the redshift dependence of the cold gas accretion
rate as few observational constraints exist On the other hand numerical estimates of ac-
cretion growth are possible For z  2 accretion rates show a strong increase towards lower
z and a sharp decline thereafter
In order to delineate the relevant parameter space for mergers we dene two dimen-
sionless parameters the energy E  2E2 and the specic angular momentum j  jrm
where  is the inner dispersion velocity and rm is the median half-mass radius of an ide-
alised galaxy With a gross simplication of such spherical nonrotating equal-mass galax-
ies it is possible to delineate the j  E parameter space of mergers with a characteristic
timescale of less than the Hubble time Fig 3 Note that merging can occur also from
 13 
Fig 3 Criterion for merging modied Figure 7-9 from Binney  Tremaine 1987 which is
based on the time required for the merging of two galaxies as a function of the initial position of
the binary orbit in the j  E plane Orbits are only possible outside the forbidden region delineated
by the solid lane circular orbits All elliptical bound and some hyperbolic unbound orbits
below the dashed lane will eventually lead to a merger However merging time increases rapidly
toward the upper-right corner and above the dashed lane the merging time exceeds the Hubble
unbound orbits As a rule of thumb only galaxies with relative velocities less than their
internal dispersion velocities vrel   will merge Dispersion velocities inside large galaxies
are   200300 km s1 while that of clusters of galaxies 5001000 km s1 The merger
orbital angular momentum depends on vrel and contributes to the spin A simple recipe to
increase the parameter space for mergers is the dynamical friction mechanism

31 Mergers and associated processes
311 Minor mergers and dynamical friction
Minor mergers are those with m M When the massive galaxy with mass M moves
among the background of low-mass m galaxies or else with velocity v dynamical friction is
a good approximation The drag per unit mass resulting from a gravitational wake is given
by Chandrasekhar 1943
4ln G2M
Fcid16 v
2cid17cid16 v
vcid17
where  bmax maxrh GMv2 is the Coulomb logarithm bmax is the maximum impact
parameter  is the background density of m galaxies and F is the error function In the
low-v limit the drag is  v and in the high-v limit it is  v2 Also the dynamical friction
force is  M 2 and the DM appears as an important contributor to the friction during the
merging process Assuming a circular orbit with a radius r for M moving around a bound
accumulation of m masses one can arrive at the analytical solution for rt which is a linear
function of time However in a more realistic case M plunges in a very elongated orbit
with a small pericentre leading to a substantial tidal disruption and an associated mass loss
very early This of course complicates the analytical solution eg Diemand et al 2007
Romano-Daz et al 2010 and tends to decrease the characteristic timescale for the friction
eg Boylan-Kolchin et al 2008
The specics of the dynamical friction are that it is a local and not a global force in
the Chandrasekhar approximation which assumes that the m particles interact only with
M The situation is more complicated if self-gravitational eects are taken into account
which is most relevant for galactic disks The most interesting corollary is the introduction
of resonances between the orbital motion of M and motion of m in the disk both azimuthal
radial and vertical eg Lynden-Bell  Kalnajs 1972 Other intricacies appear as well but
are not discussed here eg Mo et al 2010
The eect of dynamical friction on multiple mergers has been shown explicitly in nu-
merical simulations of Nipoti et al 2003 who ran them with and without friction with the
goal of modelling the formation of cD galaxies in the centres of galaxy clusters The char-
acteristic timescale for merging has been substantially shortened when the Chandrasekhar
drag has acted compared to merging in a xed background potential
 15 
312 Mergers phase mixing and violent relaxation
The two-body relaxation timescale is too long to have an eect on mergers where
the relaxation is dominated by collisionless processes such as phase mixing and violent
relaxation  relaxation in the mean eld Both mechanisms have been introduced by Lynden-
Bell 1967 Behind the idea of phase mixing lies the time evolution of a coarse-grained
distribution function in a collisionless system As the classical entropy is conserved in the
absence of collisions the ne-grained function is time-independent while the coarse-grained
function evolves to uniformly cover the available phase space for the system thus maximising
the corresponding coarse-grained entropy Phase mixing therefore tends to destroy coherent
phase-space structure
Violent relaxation is a relaxation in the time-dependent potential of the system when
the specic energy of a particle is not conserved This process leads to a Maxwellian dis-
tribution of velocities in which the temperature is proportional to the mass of the particle
So particle dispersion velocities become independent of the particle mass Violent relax-
ation is most relevant at the time of virialisation of the system so the characteristic time
is the crossing time of the system This leads to a more complete relaxation in the central
regions compared to the outskirts because the dynamical timescale becomes prohibitively
long there On the other hand galaxy interactions would drive violent relaxation mostly in
the outer regions It is still unclear how ecient this process is overall
32 Dry and wet disk mergers spheroids or rebuilding
Mergers between systems that include stars and DM only are called dry mergers Exam-
ples a merger of two elliptical galaxies or one between an elliptical and a lenticular galaxy
Only limited observational data exists on dry mergers mostly in clusters of galaxies eg
van Dokkum et al 1999 The endproduct of this process is predicted to be an ellipsoidal
system eg Toomre  Toomre 1972 Barnes 1992 as inferred from the Sersic law The
mixing appears incomplete and the metallicity gradient is not fully erased The emergence
of the red sequence of massive galaxies has been linked to the increasing importance of dry
mergers after z  1 because of the seemingly insucient amount of massive blue galaxies
that can serve as their precursors eg Khochfar  Burkert 2003 Faber et al 2007 How
important the contribution is of dry mergers in forming the red sequence however is unclear
Dry mergers have been studied using the GEMS Galaxy Evolution from Morphology
and SEDs Spectral Energy Distributions survey in tandem with the COMBO-17 photo-
metric redshift survey in order to constrain their frequency between z  0207 eg Bell et
 16 
al 2006 Accompanying N-body simulations have been used to explore the morphological
signatures of such mergers An estimated rate of 052 major mergers between spheroids
over the z  0207 period has been claimed to be consistent with the limit of  1 such event
in recent times estimated using an alternative semi-analytic method This indicates that
dry mergers can indeed be an important factor in driving the evolution towards massive red
galaxies at present times but more work is clearly required
Scaling relations such as Faber-Jackson 1976 FJ Kormendy 1977 the fundamental
plane Djorgovski  Davis 1987 and others can provide in principle important information
about the formation of massive ellipticals and constrain it N-body simulations have shown
that multiple dry mergers preserve the FJ relation but produce lower central dispersion
velocities and increase the eective radius although the fundamental plane of ellipticals
remains thin Nipoti et al 2003 Ciotti et al 2007 conrmed that the FJ Kormendy
and fundamental plane relations are robust against dry merging although caveats exist An
important question is when are these scaling relations established
Wet mergers involve gas and are therefore dissipative Here we focus on mergers which
involve galactic disks with various gas fractions When disks are involved the outcome
depends on many more parameters including the disk plane orientation with respect to
the orbital plane and the alignment of internal spins rotation with the orbital spin ie
prograde versus retrograde encounters
The rst simulations of disk interactions were performed by Holmberg 1941 using a
light-bulb supercomputer with the important result that tidal forces lead to the formation
of spiral structure in galaxies Modern numerical simulations have revealed a rich library of
processes involving disk interactions and mergers stretching harassment stripping stran-
gulation squelching threshing splashback and cannibalism Additional eects include en-
hanced star formation rates and quenching the star formation eg recall that spheroids are
associated with quenched star formation The outcome of disk galaxy mergers can be either
spheroidal or disk systems
The early arguments about disk merger remnants were based on N-body simulations
without or with low-resolution gas The merging proceeded via dynamical friction against
the DM component The DM haloes have been soaking up the internal and orbital angular
momenta of merging galaxies and the collision appeared sticky eg Hernquist 1992 Over-
all the simulations have been successful in tting the properties of the elliptical products
although the remnants appeared too diuse compared to observed massive ellipticals The
morphology of interacting and merging galaxies has been closely matched eg Hibbard 
Mihos 1995 Dubinski et al 1996 have studied the merging of pure stellar disks in live
DM haloes focussing on the shapes of tidal tails when disks are being stretched impart-
 17 
ing kinetic energy to the stars The length and mass of tidal tails have been found to be
sensitive to the gradient of the gravitational potential Hence tails can successfully map
the DM potential well and constrain the overall DM mass distribution The problem was
in reproducing the high phase density observed in the centres of elliptical galaxies This
situation changed with the inclusion of a dissipative component in simulations
Numerical simulations have indicated that the dynamical role of gas is well in excess
of its mass fraction This has been shown for isolated galactic models eg Shlosman 
Noguchi 1993 Heller  Shlosman 1994 as well as for fully cosmological models eg Barnes
 Hernquist 1996 Due to its dissipative nature gas is always losing its energy and angular
momentum which leads to a central accumulation where the gas successfully competes with
stellar and DM contributions to the gravitational potential The deepening of the potential
well by the gas resolves one of the outstanding issues we have mentioned above  high phase
density in the centres of ellipticals Barnes  Hernquist 1996 have found that the gas
presence shortens the merging timescale and drives a large fraction of gas to the very centre
of the remnant This evolution is relatively insensitive to the detailed physics given that
the gas is able to cool Simulations of mergers involving disks with 10 or less gas mass
fraction lead to the formation of a spheroidal stellar component with a surface brightness of
the de Vaucouleurs 14 law and a central stellar cusp which is not observed in such galaxies
These simulations have shown that wet mergers can be responsible for the formation of some
ellipticals The question is what fraction
Diculties with the scenario of ellipticals forming in binary major mergers of disk galax-
ies include the following typical ellipticals are more metal-rich than typical present-day disks
see Fig 4 ellipticals have older stellar populations that seem to form on shorter timescales
and massive ellipticals could not typically have formed from binary mergers of present day
disks while they might form from high-z disks whose descendants no longer exist eg Naab
 Ostriker 2009 In addition binary mergers of any kind are not isotropic whereas massive
ellipticals are
Probably the most intriguing issue of disk mergers is whether disks can survive mergers
Simulations of disk mergers without gas point to a clear trend of mergers thickening and
destroying the disks eg Kazantzidis et al 2008 Robertson  Bullock 2008 The corollary
is that the disks must grow rather quiescently But what about the more relevant situation
where disks contain gas and there are plenty of leftovers from mergers What is the
outcome when the disks not only contain gas but are gas-rich Is there a critical gas fraction
fgas for disk survival
Indications that disks can reform after some major mergers if sucient amounts of gas
can be maintained come from simulations of pure-gas bulgeless disks on prograde parabolic

disks with fgas  05 eg Robertson et al 2006 Robertson  Bullock 2008 or continuous
accretion of the cold gas following a destructive merger eg Steinmetz  Navarro 2002
show a similar trend Arguments that disk heating has been overestimated in minor mergers
have been advanced as well eg Hopkins et al 2008 Romano-Daz et al 2008b Recent
high-resolution simulations of over-dense regions in the Universe have shown a resilient
disk-dominated population of galaxies Fig 5 at z  810 Romano-Daz et al 2011b
Subsequent analysis of disk growth in such regions reveals that the dominant growth mode
is not via major mergers but rather through accretion of cold gas Romano-Daz et al 2012
as we discuss in Sections 5 and 7
Attempts to understand the conditions for disk survival on cosmological timescales have
delineated the main contributing factors which can increase the disk endurance an existing
reservoir of cold gas which is able to resupply it on a short dynamical timescale delayed star

formation in order to avoid a destructive starburst which would quench the growth of the
stellar disk and continued ability of the shocked gas to cool radiatively on a short timescale
more about this in the next section In other words the disk rebuilding processes should
be more ecient than the destructive processes during the merger event No universal
solution to this problem exists although with a sucient amount of ne tuning progress
has been made
Among the few successful examples of an ecient rebuilding of the disk component is a
numerical study of disk galaxy evolution following a 161 wet merger at z  08 Governato
et al 2009 The environment chosen for this experiment was typical of eld haloes and
Milky Way parameters for the re-simulated galaxy SN feedback has been responsible for
the delayed star formation For this purpose the blastwave approximation has been used
see Section 62 where the cooling shuts o over a Sedov crossing time of 3 107 yr over
0204 kpc regions corresponding also to the resolution limit of the model During the
phase of z  3 fgas in the progenitor disks was below 025 Over the period of disk rebuilding
 few Gyr the old stellar population found in the thick disk has faded considerably Thus
the formed thin disk dominated the light in the I-band while the thick disk contributed
70 of the stellar mass and the stellar halo component faded by z  0
A number of corollaries follow attempts to rebuild and sustain disks over cosmological
times First it apparently requires the existence of a thick stellar disk component which
represents the population of a pre-merger disk A beautiful example is that of NGC 4762
which exhibits both thin and thick disks eg Burstein 1979 If the thickening has been
abrupt the radial extent of the thick disk provides the size of the original disk at the
merger event The absence of thick disks in some late-type galaxies eg NGC 4244 can
be interpreted as a challenge to numerical simulations
It is therefore encouraging that
Comeron et al 2011 claim to have identied a sign of the thick disk in this object On the
other hand it is plausible that in some mergers the stellar disks are destroyed completely
The other issue lies in the prohibitively long disk-rebuilding timescale at low z a few
Gyr While this timescale severely limits the number of destructive mergers a galaxy can
have at low redshift z  1 it is unacceptable at high redshift z  6 Simulations show
however that characteristic timescales for similar processes are substantially shorter at high
z by about a factor of ten which maintains a robust population of disks even in highly
over-dense regions eg Romano-Daz et al 2011b 2012 The morphology-density relation
during the epoch of reionisation therefore does not follow the trend it exhibits at low z At
what redshifts does this relation take the form of the observed one
Among the numerous corollaries of disk mergers is their plausible contribution to clas-
sical bulges The observed frequency and mass fraction of classical bulges in disk galaxies
 21 
are debatable at present specically with respect to other bulge types For example the
origin of so-called disky bulges is unrelated to galaxy interactions and they result mostly
from stellar bar instabilities eg Combes et al 1990 Pfenniger  Friedli 1991 Raha et
al 1991 Berentzen et al 1998 Patsis et al 2002 Martnez-Valpuesta et al 2006 see also
review by Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 This makes it even more dicult to obtain a quan-
titative estimate of their link to mergers On top of this the merger outcome is sensitive to
various associated physical processes and kinematical parameters As numerical simulations
themselves depend on subgrid and sometimes unknown physics attempts have focused on
semi-analytical models although their predictive power has not been veried
Using observational constraints on disk masses and gas fractions fgas in galaxies Hop-
kins et al 2010 have attempted to predict the properties of merger remnants and speci-
cally to quantify the contribution to classical bulge formation from mergers of various mass
ratios The main result was that major mergers dominate the assembly of L bulges while
minor mergers dominate the formation of bulges in low-mass systems The bulge-to-total
mass ratio BT  was found to trace the merger mass ratio gal A simple correlation
BT  gal1  fgas has been identied The straightforward corollary of this correlation
is that increasing the gas fraction tends to suppress the bulge formation which has been
interpreted in terms of a reduced eciency of gas angular momentum loss with increasing
fgas The by-product of this conclusion is that collisionless systems lose angular momentum
more eciently than dissipative ones something which is dicult to accept
As a next logical step one can ask whether gas-rich high-z disks themselves form in
mergers A sample of such massive 1011 M disk galaxies at z  2 has been analysed with
SINFONIVLT integral-eld spectroscopy Genzel et al 2008 Large random motions have
been detected and interpreted in terms of rapid inows from cold accretion ows which orig-
inated in cosmic web laments Section 5 Such turbulence can reduce the viscous accretion
timescale to below 1 Gyr The detailed example of the galaxy BzK 15504 at z  238 has
been studied in sucient detail by Genzel et al 2006 This object is characterised by
a high star formation rate of 140 M yr1 a gas mass of 4 1010 M and a gas-to-star
mass ratio of 05 The ratio of circular to dispersion velocity v  3 points to a geomet-
rically thick disk and has been interpreted as the formation stage of the thick galactic disk
Interestingly BzK 15504 shows no obvious signs of a recent or ongoing merger eg no obvi-
ous line-of-sight velocity asymmetry So is this object a proto-disk caught in the stage of a
rapid but secular evolution Unfortunately there is no simple answer to this question The
problem lies in that the same kinematic parameters can also characterise a merger remnant
as shown by Robertson  Bullock 2008

4 Mergers and their secondary by-products
41 Tidal dwarfs
The denition of a merger process as one which decreases the number of galaxies see
Section 3 has its drawbacks The deformation and the possible destruction of interacting
disks manifests itself also in the creation of clumps of stars and molecular gas  so-called
tidal dwarfs the by-products of mergers One can argue that tidal dwarfs are not bona
de galaxies as they are not expected to contain a signicant amount of DM We shall stay
away from this dispute There is an additional dierence between these objects and normal
galaxies  they are expected to be made of recycled material with metals and dust and
not have the primordial composition of the rst galaxies or of low-metallicity dwarfs Tidal
dwarfs are usually associated with antenna-type tidal tails of their massive parent galaxies
are gas rich have both old and young stellar populations and contain both Hi and H2 as
noted by Braine et al 2001 in their survey Tidal dwarfs are characterised by a much
larger 100 of CO luminosity compared to other dwarf galaxies of comparable optical
luminosity Because of the relative proximity of these objects they can serve as testing labs
for our understanding of the galaxy formation process albeit dierent from that in the early
Universe
42 Polar ring galaxies and ring galaxies
While the tidal dwarfs represent a transient phenomenon during galaxy mergers polar
rings are expected to describe a rather steady-state situation when the externally acquired
material nds stable orbits in the plane orthogonal to the equatorial plane of the galaxy A
number of preferentially early-type disks or ellipticals show such rings lying in their polar
planes and therefore kinematically distinct from their parent galaxies The rings appear
younger than their host galaxies which seem to be depleted of cold gas Polar rings include
young stellar populations apparently formed after the capture and are gas-rich a few times
109 M and dusty eg van Driel et al 2002
Two main alternative explanations based on merger kinematics include the accretion or
capture of satellites from a nearly circular orbit or the collisional destruction and subsequent
capture of a donor from a rather radial orbit Under special conditions the accretion of cold
gas by the host galaxy can also result in the formation of polar rings In the accretion scenario
eg Schweizer et al 1983 Reshetnikov  Sotnikova 1997 about 10 of the donor disk
gas is captured in a polar ring in less than 1 Gyr The collision scenario of galactic disks
eg Bekki 1998 involves orthogonally oriented disks in a head-on low-velocity collision
 23 
Bournaud  Combes 2003 have tested both alternatives in numerical simulations and
conclude that the accretion scenario is more supported by observations although one cannot
exclude either possibility We note that numerical simulations of galaxy formation at higher
z have demonstrated routinely the formation of polar-ring galaxies as a product of merging
and interaction within the computational box eg Romano-Daz et al 2009 Roskar et al
An interesting aspect of polar rings is that they can provide information about the DM
halo shapes eg Sackett  Sparke 1990 This is possible because the rings are long-lived
and therefore have sucient time to settle on regular orbits in the polar plane of the host
galaxy which is determined by the extended DM halo The measured at rotation curves of
the rings point to the existence of such haloes around parent galaxies The self-gravity of the
gas settling in the rings is also a stabilising factor in their dynamics otherwise dierential
precession would destroy them in a short orbital time This conclusion is a clear outcome
of orbital analysis in a triaxial potential eg Sparke 1986 Arnaboldi  Sparke 1994 and
numerical simulations of ring formation and evolution eg Bournaud  Combes 2003
Depending on the mass and orientation of polar rings a number of stable and unstable
equilibria are possible If the attening of the DM halo can be constrained independently
eg from lensing one can obtain bounds on the halo or overall mass triaxiality merely
assuming that the observed rings are stable
The Cartwheel galaxy represents another class of rings most probably originating from
head-on collisions involving at least one gas-rich disk Unlike polar rings these rings are
not stationary are frequently o-centred and represent an expanding density wave which
triggers star formation Lynds  Toomre 1976 The relative velocity of these collisions
appears to be much higher than those leading to polar rings eg Horellou  Combes 2001
It is characteristic of a galaxy cluster environment as we discuss below
Mergers in clusters galaxy harassment
In a galaxy cluster environment high-velocity encounters between galaxies have relative
velocities vgal  cl  gal where vgal  103 km s1 is the typical relative velocity of galaxies in
clusters gal  100200 km s1 the intrinsic velocity dispersion in galaxies and cl the velocity
dispersion in clusters The corollary is that high-velocity encounters dominate in clusters and
are more frequent than in the eld environment and that direct collisions are rare Hence
one should expect that galaxies are more morphologically disturbed in clusters which makes
them vulnerable to future encounters as well as to the eects of cluster tides The encounter
dynamics can be approximated by the impulse approximation The cumulative eect of the
 24 
above processes is called galaxy harassment One of the main questions is whether galaxies
form dierently in clusters or whether environmental processes as described above make
them dierent
Observationally in the local Universe cluster galaxies appear redder than in the eld
and are more spheroid-dominated Tidal disturbances are common from close passages
Local clusters possess no spiral disks as reected by their morphology-density relation eg
Dressler 1980
In comparison already at z  04 clusters contain many small disturbed
spirals which are replaced by spheroidals at the faint end of the galaxy luminosity function
LF at z  0 They contain a substantial population of blue star-forming and starbursting
galaxies  a reection of the Butcher-Oemler 1978 eect Star-forming rings are much
more frequent in clusters than two-armed spirals eg Oemler et al 1997 Furthermore in
hierarchical models of structure formation the eld galaxy inux into clusters peaks around
z  04 eg Kaumann 1995 and the star formation declines abruptly around z  05
resulting in a large population of passive post-starburst galaxies eg Dressler et al 1999
Poggianti et al 1999 This quenching of star formation measured for example by a
decline in the H emission in the cluster environment is a reection of the overall trend in
galaxy evolution which ultimately leads to the formation of the so-called red sequence In
other words the star formation and morphological evolution in clusters appear to decouple
at lower redshifts eg Couch et al 2001
One way to understand the environmental eects on galaxy evolution is to compare and
contrast the evolution of disk galaxies in rich clusters with that of eld galaxies Numerical
simulations have revealed the details of galaxy harassment in such over-dense elds eg
Moore et al 1998 where disks are subject to interactions with brighter and more massive
neighbours  a process that injects energy and makes them vulnerable to the cluster tidal
eld Moreover the gas stripping process acts eciently in the central regions of clusters
eg Tonnesen et al 2007 These processes aect disk galaxies almost exclusively  dense
ellipticals are basically immune to the eects of harassment Furthermore the r14 de Vau-
couleurs surface brightness prole appears robust and invariant to harassment even when a
galaxy loses 40 of its mass during an interaction eg Aguilar  White 1986
44 Mergers and star formation rates
Below we discuss how mergers inuence the star formation rates SFRs Here we
emphasise the morphological evolution these disks experience which results in loss of the
gaseous component partly ablated and partly falling to the centre and in a dramatic con-
version of disks into spheroidals Late-type ScSd disks appear to be more aected by this
 25 
In addition the ram pressure by the intracluster hot gas is  hot2
cl while the
process
restoring force is  2tot where tot is the disk total surface density gas  stars The
stripping occurs when the ram pressure exceeds the restoring force leading to the transfor-
mation to lenticular galaxies When the outer hot gas which is only loosely bound to the
DM halo is stripped this is called strangulation
Simulations have also demonstrated an agreement with observations both in accounting
for intermediate-age stellar population in these spheroidals and in their shapes  which
appear prolate and attened by velocity dispersion anisotropy
We now turn to the issue of merger-induced star formation There is no doubt that
mergers are responsible for the largest starbursts eg the ultra-luminous infrared galaxies
ULIRGS The most intensely star-forming galaxies are in the advanced stage of merging
But is the reverse true In other words does the merger rate drive the SFR
Since z  1 the cosmic SFR per unit comoving volume appears to decrease by a factor
of ten eg Madau et al 1998 Because over this time period most of the star formation is
associated with disk galaxies the inevitable conclusion is that the disks are shutting down
their star-forming activity While in principle a number of processes can contribute to this
evolutionary trend here we focus on the contribution from major mergers to triggering the
star formation Because the LF of galaxies at these redshifts is dominated by normal
galaxies Fig 6 the eect of mergers cannot be the principal one as noted by Bell et al
2005 This conclusion is based on the analysis of the deep 24 m survey made by the MIPS
Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer  Team Rieke et al 2004 combined with the
COMBO-17 redshift and SED survey Wolf et al 2004 and the GEMS survey Rix et
al 2004 The covered redshift interval is 065075 and includes about 1500 galaxies in the
CDFS Chandra Deep Field South About 40 of galaxies with stellar masses  2 1010 M
have been found to be undergoing a period of elevated intense star formation at z  07 while
only  1 of similarly massive galaxies exhibit such star-forming activity at z  0 Moreover
the IR LF and the SFR densities at z  07 are dominated by morphologically undisturbed
galaxies More than 50 of the starbursting galaxies are spirals but  30 appear to be
strongly interacting Hence the decline in the SFR is not driven by the decline in the major
merger rate Rather factors that do not strongly alter the galaxy morphology are at play
here eg weak interactions and gas depletion Bell et al 2005 argue that the selection
procedure used should not introduce any special bias against obscured starburst galaxies
To quantify the average enhancement in the SFR of major mergers between massive
 1010 M galaxies including pre- and post-mergers Robaina et al 2009 used COMBO-
17 and 24 m SFR from Spitzer in tandem with the GEMS and STAGES HST surveys for
z  0408 Major interactions have been dened here as being resolved in HST imaging
 26 
Fig 6 Estimated 81000 m LF split by morphological type for 397 galaxies at z  065075
see text for details Only galaxies detected at 24 m are shown and no attempt to extrapolate to
lower IR luminosities has been made the sample is grossly incomplete below 6  1010 L as denoted
by the grey dotted line In each panel the grey solid histogram shows the total IR LF The shaded
area shows the IR LF split by galaxy type using GEMS-derived galaxy classications where the
extent of the shaded area explicitly shows the dierences in IR LF given by the three dierent
classiers The black histogram shows the IR LF averaged over the three dierent classiers and
corrected to reproduce the increased fraction of clearly interacting galaxies seen in GOODS-depth
data from Bell et al 2005
 27 
having a mass ratio of  14 based on the luminosity ratio and exhibiting clear signs of
interaction Major merger remnants have been identied using a highly disturbed train
wreck morphology double nuclei and tidal tails of similar length or spheroidal remnants
with large-scale tidal debris Prominent disks with signs of merging ie highly asymmetric
spirals or a single tidal tail have been assumed to be minor mergers
In addition the enhancement in the SFR has been evaluated as a function of the pro-
jected galaxy separation While conrming that most starbursting galaxies are in the process
of merging Robaina et al 2009 have found that SFRs in major-merger systems are only
elevated by a factor of 18 compared to those in non-interacting ones when averaged over
all interactions and all stages of interaction see also Li et al 2008 Sommerville et al 2008
The main enhancement is visible for close pairs with projected separations of  40 kpc Over-
all about 8 3 of the total star formation has been estimated to be directly triggered
by major interactions This indeed conrms the conclusion of Bell et al 2005 mentioned
above that major mergers are not the dominant factor in building the stellar mass at z  1
and therefore they are not responsible for the decline in the SFR over this time
We now discuss the input from numerical simulations which test the above observational
results on the relation between major mergers and SFRs Di Matteo et al 2007 have
focussed on this issue by modelling galaxy collisions of all Hubble types while varying both
bulge-to-disk mass ratios and fgas Direct and retrograde orbits have been used and star
formation in interacting and merging galaxies has been compared to that in isolated galaxies
The main outcome is that the retrograde orbits seem to produce more starbursts and the star
formation eciency is higher in the sense of star formation per unit mass Moreover these
starbursts are essentially nuclear starbursts from the gas inow triggered by the gravitational
torques from asymmetries induced by the tides
In a comprehensive study of unequal-mass mergers Cox et al 2008 have quantied the
eect of tidal forces on the star formation Specically they have focused on the eect of mass
ratio merging orbits and galaxy structure on merger-driven starbursts These kinematical
and morphological parameters are of prime importance for the main issue  the relation
between mergers and SFRs It was found that merger-induced star formation is a strong
function of the merger mass ratio which spans over a factor of 23 being negligible for small
mass-ratio mergers  a straightforward dependence on the tides strength An additional
parameter that is helpful to measure the induced star formation is starburst eciency 
the fraction of gas that is converted into stars over the interaction time The starburst
eciency was found to be insensitive to the details of the feedback parameterisation from
stellar evolution  this is very helpful because the feedback physics is suciently uncertain
Overall the burst eciencies have been reduced compared to previous studies
 28 
However while the burst eciency for equal-mass mergers does not depend on the
merger orbital parameters disk orientation or the primary galaxy properties this diers for
unequal-mass mergers Direct coplanar-orbit mergers produce the most signicant bursts
at close passages The other important factor appears to be the mass distribution in the
primary galaxy For example a massive concentrated stellar bulge stabilises the disk and
suppresses the induced star formation More gas driven above the threshold density for star
formation reduces the burst eciency and so is a more ecient feedback
In summary recent studies of mergers agree that the evolution of the merger rates
after z  1 is not responsible for the overall decrease in SFR in the Universe The obvious
direction for improving the numerical simulations of merger-induced star formation requires
incorporating them into the cosmological context  so far simulations deal with isolated
pairs of interacting and merging galaxies This will allow accounting for the eect of cold-
gas accretion which is expected to compete with merger-induced galaxy growth especially at
higher redshifts Lastly increases in the number of particles both collisional and collisionless
are important for modelling the disk response during the interaction and merging periods
Small numbers of the particles are known to destabilise the disks owing to increased noise
5 Disk growth cold accretion
Figure 2 displays two plausible modes of galaxy growth galaxy mergers and gas accre-
tion While we know that the frequency of interactions and mergers increases steeply with
redshift the availability of unvirialised gas increases as well In Sections 3 and 4 we reviewed
galaxy growth driven by mergers mainly the growth of galactic disks Here we focus on the
alternative process of galaxy growth via the accretion of unvirialised baryons and DM
51 The standard view and the new paradigm
The ability of galaxies to grow by means of accretion has been known for some time
The standard view has been that gas falling into a DM halo shocks to a virial temperature
Tvir at around the halo virial radius Rvir and lls it up remaining in a quasi-hydrostatic
equilibrium with Tvir  106 vcirc167 km s12 K Hot virialised gas cools from the inside out
loses its pressure support and settles into a centrifugally-supported disk Rees  Ostriker
1977 White  Rees 1978 Fall  Efstathiou 1980
This view has been substantially modied now in that not all the gas is shocked when
Instead much of the gas is capable of entering the halo along denser
it enters the halo
 29 
Fig 7 Left The standard view  gas shocks at Rvir becomes pressure-supported then cools
down and settles in a disk Right The new paradigm  some of the gas shocks but the majority
enters the DM halo in the cold phase along the laments feeding the disk growth
laments and penetrating deeply  this radical shift in understanding has led to a new
paradigm Fig 7
52 Accretion shock
Birnboim  Dekel 2003 have performed an idealised analytical study of gas accretion
on a spherical DM halo assuming two alternatives an adiabatic equation of state and
radiative cooling The solution has been tested with a 1-D hydrodynamic code The incoming
gas is not virialised and therefore its motion is supersonic creating favourable conditions
for the virial shock  its existence and stability have been analysed The crucial support for
this shock comes from the post-shock gas If the virialised gas is adiabatic or its cooling is
inecient the shock-heated gas becomes subsonic with respect to the shock and its support
for the shock remains stable with the shock positioned at  Rvir This is always the case for
the adiabatic gas which is also stable against gravitational collapse ie Jeans instability
if the adiabatic index   43 Gravitationally unstable gas will collapse to the centre thus
removing support from the shock which will rapidly move inwards The gas can be treated
as adiabatic when the radiative cooling timescale is longer than the collapse timescale The
gravitational stability condition is slightly modied for gas with radiative cooling to an
eective adiabatic index which includes the time derivatives e  d ln Pdtd ln dt
Its critical value e  crit  2  23  107 is close to the adiabatic case Here P
and  are thermal pressure and density in the gas For a monatomic gas with   53 this
 30 
stability condition can be rewritten as
0RsT1
 00126
where 0 is the preshock gas density u0 and u1 are the pre- and post-shock gas velocities
T1  u2
0 is the post-shock temperature Rs is the shock radius and T  is the cooling
function
While the 1-D hydrodynamics is an obvious simplication of both the halo and gas
properties its simplicity has a certain advantage in that it allows one to follow the analytical
solution closely It shows that the adiabatic shock exists always and gradually propagates
outwards coinciding with the virial radius Rvir On the other hand for radiative cooling in
the gas with primordial composition the shock exists only where the inow encounters the
disk initially With the halo growth this shock also moves outwards and stabilises around
Rvir In the following we shall argue that the cold inow can join the disk smoothly without
being shock-heated  ie that 1-D hydrodynamics cannot capture this solution
This simple 1-D model predicts a critical value for the DM halo mass above which
the shock is supported at Rvir A weak dependence on the redshift of halo virialisation
exists and a stronger dependence on the gas metallicity as well because it aects the
cooling signicantly The mass range for the critical halo mass appears to be 1011 M
for a primordial gas composition and 5 1011 M for about 005 of the Solar metallicity
For this metallicity Press-Schechter M haloes will generate stable shocks only by z  16
The corollary virial shocks will form only in the massive haloes mentioned above at low
redshifts The general condition for shock stability is that the cooling timescale of the
shocked gas should be longer than the compression timescale
A number of issues can complicate these conclusions arbitrary triaxial halo shapes
the interaction between the supersonic gas infall and the forming disk and the possible
trapping of Ly photons within the halo gas The rst two issues can be resolved in terms
of numerical simulations see below The trapping of Ly photons during gravitational
collapse and its eects on the fragmentation and related issues of proto-disk formation are
under investigation eg Spaans  Silk 2006 Latif et al 2011
Following the analytical1-D hydro approach discussed above numerical simulations
have been performed addressing a number of issues eg what is the maximum temperature
of the gas entering the DM haloes The standard view has been that Tmax  Tvir but as we
have already discussed not all of the gas is shocked to Tvir It is helpful to dene two modes
of accretion  rst a cold mode with a maximum temperature of Tmax  Tvir  105 K which
was not shock-heated is distributed anisotropically and follows laments into the DM halo
 31 
Second a hot mode with Tmax  Tvir  105 K which has been shock-heated at  Rvir cools
down while in a quasi-static gas halo and is accreted quasi-isotropically The lamentary
inow of the cold gas exhibits much lower entropy  T 23 compared to the shocked halo
gas eg Nagai  Kravtsov 2003
Simulations reveal a more complex picture when some of the gas is accreted via la-
ments and some from cooling of the hot halo gas Keres et al 2005 Dekel  Birnboim
2006 Only about half of the gas follows the expected path of accretion which is heated
to Tvir then cools down and participates in the star formation The rest of the gas stays
much cooler at all times The overall emerging picture is that of a bi-modal evolution of
accreting gas Specically the cold mode dominates in low-mass galaxies and DM haloes
Mgal  2 1010 M and Mh  25 1011 M respectively and the hot mode dominates in
the higher-mass objects As a result the cold mode is expected to dominate at high redshift
and in the low-density environment at low redshifts The hot mode will dominate in the
high-density environment at low z such as in galaxy clusters
The quoted critical baryonic mass Mgal  2 1010 M obtained from numerical sim-
ulations is close to the observed characteristic mass for a shift in galaxy properties
Mgal  3 1010 M eg Kaumann et al 2004 Kannappan 2004 based on a complete
sample of SDSS galaxies These studies focussed on the environmental dependence of var-
ious parameters which describe the galaxies such as morphology stellar mass SFR etc
quantifying the distribution of these properties with respect to galaxy mass For stellar
masses above the critical Mgal no dependence on environmental factors has been found for
the distribution of sizes and concentrations at xed stellar masses whereas for less massive
galaxies the trend has been detected for galaxies to be somewhat more concentrated and
more compact in denser regions The star formation history has been found to be much more
sensitive to the environment eg the relation between the   4000 A break specic SFR
per unit stellar mass and Mgal  with the same separator of 3 1010 M The drop in
the specic SFR for less massive galaxies was about a factor of ten over the density interval
used in the study much stronger in comparison with the more massive galaxies
An interesting corollary is the apparent similarity between the redshift evolution of
galaxy properties and their change as a function of a local density
In retrospect this
result is almost a common wisdom reecting the sped up evolution of galaxies in over-
dense regions in the Universe
Hence compelling observational evidence exists that galaxies below the critical mass of
Mgal  3 1010 M are much more active in forming stars have larger gas fractions lower
surface densities and exhibit late-type morphologies More massive galaxies have old stellar
populations supplemented with low gas fraction higher surface densities and early Hubble

types This bimodal behaviour can have its origin in the fundamental way the galaxies grow
or rather in the way their growth is limited If indeed a large fraction of the accreted gas is
not heated to the virial temperatures it can join the disk and be converted into stars We
discuss the associated processes in Section 54 The shock-heated gas on the other hand
can also contribute to the star formation if its cooling time is suciently short So some
of the hot-mode gas in haloes somewhat smaller than the critical one to sustain the shock
eg in low-density regions andor at higher z will cool down if not subjected to feedback
This gas can contribute to disk or spheroidal buildup over time
However as pointed out by Dekel  Birnboim 2006 above the halo mass of Mh  1012 M
the cooling timescale for 1067 K hot- and low-density gas becomes longer than the Hubble
time and the gas once heated to the virial temperature will never cool down and hence
will not contribute to the disk growth in any direct way This hot gas which lls up the halo
can also be subject to additional heating by AGN feedback both mechanical throughout
the halo and radiative at the base because of its high covering factor For massive haloes
we expect that the only real eect of this feedback can be in generating an outow of the
overheated gas
While this is only a circumstantial observational argument in favour of the existence of
cold lamentary ows it is nevertheless very intriguing by bringing up the same bimodality
in galaxy properties The prime observational issue of course remains the detection of these
ows Hot gaseous haloes have been detected in X-rays around individual galaxies groups
and clusters of galaxies eg Crain et al 2010ab Anderson  Bregman 2011 There
is no direct observational evidence in favour of cold accretion ows although accretion of
cold patchy gas has been observed eg Rauch et al 2011 For higher-redshift galaxies
contradictory claims exist regarding the possibility that diuse Ly emission around them
comes from cold accretion ows eg Dijkstra  Loeb 2009 and represents the cooling
radiation Fardal et al 2001 or alternatively is the scattered light coming from the Hii
regions eg Furlanetto et al 2005 Rauch et al 2011 Because of various reasons including
the low emissivity absorption against bright sources like quasi-stellar objects QSOs is the
most promising way to detect the cold accreting gas especially in Ly Van de Voort et al
2012 have argued that the high column density Hi absorption detected at z  3 originates
mostly in accreting gas with T  3 105 K based on numerical simulations Rakic et al
2012 have interpreted results of the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey of Hi Ly absorption
in the vicinity of star-forming galaxies at z  228 as due to large-scale infall It is not clear
whether the individual Hi absorbers can be attributed to cold accretion based only on their
proximity to the galaxy and a low metallicity eg Giavalisco et al 2011
High-velocity clouds around the Milky Way galaxy for a recent review see Sancisi
 33 
et al 2008 can be closely related to the cold gas accretion phenomenon discussed here
Sancisi et al 2008 have detected accretion rates of 02 M in Hi clouds which is possibly
a lower limit for our Galaxy that has a SFR 1 M yr1 There are numerous ways in
which cold gas clouds can form in the accreting matter without being processed by the
DM substructure One such possibility involves Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities in the halo-
penetrating laments Keres  Hernquist 2009 But additional options exist as well These
clouds can subsequently be accreted by the galaxy and contribute to the ongoing steady star
formation there
So why has cold accretion not been detected in a decisive manner so far One can bring
up the similar situation and diculties in detecting cold accreting gas in AGN At the same
time outows are commonly detected both in AGN and in starburst galaxies The plausible
explanation may be in small cross sections low emissivity and very high column densities
along the line-of-sight due to the gas accumulation in the equatorial plane
53 Cold ows redshift evolution
The coexistence of cold and hot modes of accretion can have interesting implications
for galaxy growth These modes depend dierently on the environment as well as on the
feedback from stellar evolution and AGN Additional issues raised so far in the literature
involve a plausible dierence of the associated initial mass functions IMFs
Cosmic star formation exhibits a broad maximum at z  1 and a steep decline below
this redshift eg Madau et al 1996 This decline can be associated with the decay of the
cold accretion ows eg Keres et al 2005 Dekel  Birnboim 2006 Below z  2 massive
1012 M haloes become typical the shocks are stable around Rvir and the cooling time of
the shocked gas becomes too long eectively quenching the cold-mode accretion This denes
the critical redshift zcrit  23 After zcrit the star formation will be suppressed in massive
haloes and especially in galaxy clusters Under these conditions the observed bimodality
in galaxy properties can nd a natural explanation In terms of the prevailing colours of
stellar populations which are determined by the stellar ages and SFRs this shutdown of
the cold accretion mode will result in the relatively quick transformation of galaxies with
high SFRs This means that the origin of the red sequence can be traced directly to the
switching of the prevailing accretion mode as noted by Dekel  Birnboim 2006 It would
be a strong argument in favour of this picture if a number of bi-modal correlations such as
the colour-magnitude bulge-to-disk ratio or morphology-density ones can be explained as
corollaries of the cold gas supply shutdown at various redshifts and environments However
there is a caveat the bulge-to-disk ratio can be aected and even dominated strongly by
 34 
other processes eg Combes et al 1990 Raha et al 1991 Martnez-Valpuesta et al 2006
Other correlations may exhibit similar trends
Clearly accretion ows that have been investigated for decades as the mechanism to
power AGN are capable of playing a substantial role in growing galaxies embedded in DM
haloes Moreover within the CDM framework cold-mode accretion forms naturally because
of the low dispersion velocities in the gas that has cooled down in the expanding Universe
during the Dark Ages The large turnover radii corresponding to the accretion radius and
the substantially sub-Keplerian spin parameter  assure a strong dependence on the accretor
mass ie DM halo mass It also means that the cold-mode accretion should dominate at
high redshifts and the hot mode should only pick up at low redshifts if at all
Keres et al 2009a have investigated the cosmological evolution of smooth accretion
ows using simulations with sucient resolution to follow up growth of galaxies in massive
haloes only Cold ows appear to dominate the global gas supply to galaxies basically at all
times especially in small galaxies residing in  1012 M haloes for z  1 At these redshifts
the galaxy growth was found to be only a function of its mass At z  1 the cold accretion on
smaller galaxies has decreased sharply These results have been conrmed by Brooks et al
2009  for galaxies up to L the cold accretion fuels the star formation Romano-Daz et al
2008b argued that late minor mergers with DM substructure ablate the cold disk gas and
quench the star formation there Cold accretion dominated growth has also been inferred in
high-resolution simulations of galaxies at redshifts z  6 Romano-Daz et al 2012
Moreover the total gas accretion rate has been found to peak at z  3 and to exhibit
a broad maximum between z  24 the same as the cold accretion Hot accretion which
consists of a shocked virialised gas that is able to cool down over relative short time has
been found to contribute little over time except lately for z  1 after peaking at z  15
Mergers become globally important only after z  1 Finally the SFR has been estimated to
correlate with the smooth accretion rate and to be about a factor two of the Madau diagram
So according to Keres et al 2009a galaxies grow via the accretion of cold and never-
shocked gas while the contribution of the hot mode of cooling shock-heated virialised gas is
not important at all This is a dramatic turnaround and a paradigm shift with respect to the
standard picture described in Section 51 If veried the implications of this are broad it is
the cold mode of accretion that drives the star formation in galaxies However taken at face
value this star formation will lead to fast conversion of gas into stars  an overproduction of
the stellar mass already at an early time if the feedback from stellar evolution and AGN is
not ecient enough In short a mechanism to suppress the star formation is necessary This
is discussed in Section 6 Another corollary is the possible shock at the inow-disk interface
Is it avoidable See Section 55 for more options Is it observable Lastly the dominant
 35 
cold mode of accretion must be incorporated into the prescriptions for semi-analytic models
54 Cold ows between the virial radius and the disk
Understanding the kinematics and dynamics of the cold ow which penetrates the DM
halo and is not shocked to virial temperatures is crucial in order to estimate the ows
contribution to disk growth As the laments penetrate deep into the halo their temperature
stays approximately constant because of the ecient cooling and they are compressed by
the surrounding hot halo gas if it exists The eciency of this inow contribution to the disk
growth process is unclear at present In principle it can be expected to depend on at least
two parameters the angular momentum in the cold gas and the shape of the background
gravitational potential These will determine the prevailing trajectories within the DM haloes
and to some degree the amount of dissipation in the infalling gas As a result we shall be
able to estimate the infall timescale which will be longer than the free-fall time within the
DM halo and the way this gas joins the growing disk by smoothly merging or experiencing
a strong shock In the former case the infall energy of the gas is transformed into rotational
energy In the latter part of the infall energy will be radiated away suciently close to the
shocked interface
In smaller haloes and especially at higher redshifts the virial shock is not sustainable
at  Rvir and the forming galactic disk can be directly aected by the deposition of matter
linear and angular momenta and energy by the inow of the cold gas How much dissipation
is involved in this process Is the local ie inow-disk interface shock-unavoidable
The 1-D case discussed above is not representative here as the shock is unavoidable if
the cold inow exists and the angular momentum plays no role Based on 3-D numerical
simulations Dekel  Birnboim 2006 argue that cold streams intersecting among themselves
and with the forming disk will trigger starbursts characterised by the most common mode
of star formation in the Universe The strength of the starburst will determine whether the
disk will continue to grow relatively quiescently or whether the process will contribute to the
spheroidal component
Most cosmological simulations lack the necessary resolution to investigate the inow-
disk interface The simplest way to circumvent this is to reproduce the thermal histories of
the gas particles Brooks et al 2009 found that most of the gas joins the disk unshocked
in a smooth accreting component opposite to the gas accreted with the substructure ie
clumpy gas The only exception is the disk evolution in the most massive halo well above
L For this halo the SFR is not exactly balanced by the accretion rate onto the halo as a
 36 
Fig 8 Cats cradle morphology face-on view of the gas disk upper frames and the extended
DM regions lower frames showing the cold gas inow joining the disk The white arrows right
frames underline the DM laments and the associated gas inow Note that the gas streamlines
join the disk at tangent angles which preclude strong shocks from forming and rather assure a
smooth unshocked transition ow from Heller et al 2007b
substantial delay in star formation occurs due to the prolonged cooling time of the shocked
Heller et al 2007b have shown that the cold gas laments can smoothly join the outer
disk being deected from the disk rotation axis by the centrifugal barrier  no standing shock
has been detected there In this case the infall kinetic energy is converted into rotational
energy Interestingly the gas laments are supported by the DM laments in a conguration
which resembles the cats cradle  a small amorphous disk fuelled via nearly radial string
patterns eg Fig 8
If the inow-disk interface shock does not exist or is suciently mild what additional
signatures of a recent accretion can be expected deep inside the host haloes For a number
of reasons discussed above and in Section 2 most probably the gas has a non-negligible
 37 
amount of angular momentum and will settle in some equatorial plane outside the growing
stellar disk However the orientation of this plane can dier substantially with respect to
the stellar disk plane This will lead to the formation of inclined and polar rings warps
etc Indeed numerical simulations of such disks in a cosmological setting have demonstrated
the formation of rings and warps as a rule rather than an exception eg Romano-Daz et
al 2009 Roskar et al 2010 Stewart et al 2011 Specically Romano-Daz et al 2009
have demonstrated that the mutual orientation of the rotation axis of the disk DM halo
and the accreting gas uctuate dramatically over time even during the quiescent periods of
evolution see their Fig 19
Dekel et al 2009b have shown that galaxies of 1011 M at z  23  at the peak
of SFR in the Universe  have been fed by cold accretion streams rather than by mergers
About 13 of the stream gas mass has been found in clumps leading to mergers of  110
mass ratio the rest in the smooth streams The deep penetration of cold streams happened
even in DM haloes of  1012 M which are above the critical mass for virial shock heating
Section 52 Dekel  Birnboim 2006 have noted that the cold gas streams are supported
by DM streams whose characteristic width is smaller than Rvir and which are denser than
the diuse halo material They cross the shock basically staying isothermal because of the
short cooling distance We return to the issue of penetrating streams in Section 7 on high-z
galaxies
There is a possibility that the extended XUV disks detected by GALEX Galaxy Evo-
lution Explorer  whose population can reach 20 locally have their origin in accretion
ows eg Lemonias et al 2011 Stewart et al 2011 A strong argument in favour of such
a scenario comes from the observations of such disks around massive early-type galaxies
Moreover there is no indication that XUV disks prefer tidally-distorted disk galaxies so
they cannot originate as a result of a close passage or a merger event
In the presence of a disk one would expect that the gas accretion will join its outer parts
at least the majority of the inow as discussed above The low-j material that can come
closer to the rotation axis would be accreted earlier and such orbits would be depopulated
quickly
55 Cold accretion ows in the phase space
The phase space provides the maximum information about lamentary cold ows Even
2-D phase space allows for a clear display of the accretion ows It is especially suitable in or-
der to follow up the phase mixing and violent relaxation processes discussed in Section 312
 38 
Various complementary presentation options exist here such as using RvR rvcirc andor
r   where R and r correspond to the spherical and cylindrical radii and vR v and  to
the radial and azimuthal velocities and to the dispersion velocity respectively
Comparison of the evolution of pure DM and DMbaryon models in the R  vR plane
reveals the eect of baryon inow on the kinematics of the DM halo Fig 9 and Romano-
Daz et al 2009 The mass-averaged radial velocities are negative outside Rvir and lie
below the vR  0 line and change to positive inside the halo initially At later times the
mass-averaged velocity is zero as the inner halo reaches its virial equilibrium Both major
and minor mergers substructure can easily be distinguished by the vertical spikes and
are much more prominent by a factor of 2 for models with baryons before the tidal
disruption Moreover the smooth accretion can be well separated from the substructure
The width of the inowing stream which represents the mass accretion ux declines with
time while that of the rebounding material increases
In the process of tidal disruption
inclined ngers form again more prominent in the presence of baryons The subsequently
forming shell structure reveals the insucient mixing of merger remnants in the form of a
R vR correlation  streamers which appear to be long-lived Streamers formed after z  1
largely survive to z  0 The phase space also delineates the kinematical dierences of the
inner DM haloes in these models note the outline of vRR at small radii This eect can
be explained in terms of the gravitational potential shape there which represents a more
centrally-concentrated object
So the phase-space analysis shows that DM haloes while reaching virial equilibrium are
far from relaxed in other aspects Streamers are probably the best example of this inecient
relaxation and are strengthened by the presence of baryons The degree of relaxation in
DM haloes can be further quantied using the smoothing kernel technique Romano-Daz
et al 2009 This procedure allows us to estimate the contribution of the excess DM mass
fraction associated with density enhancements ie subhaloes tidal tails and streamers
above some smoothed reference density which is time-adjusted This excess mass fraction in
the substructure becomes more prominent with time
A complementary option to study the buildup of DM haloes is in the r  vcirc plane In
this plane the halo kinematics is much more symmetric with respect to the vcirc  0 line
Mergers disrupt this symmetry which is quickly restored Both major and minor mergers
are easily traced in such a diagram The high degree of symmetry between the number of
prograde- and retrograde-circulating particles is very important in order to understand the
dynamical state of DM haloes and growing stellar disks especially the disk-halo resonant and
non-resonant interactions which ultimately aect the disk ability to channel baryons toward
the centre eg Shlosman 2011 One note of caution at higher redshifts the haloes appear
 39 
Fig 9 Phase space evolution of a DM halo without left and with right baryons in the R vR
plane run from identical initial conditions The halo has been projected to collapse by z  13
with a mass of 1012 h1M based on the top-hat model The epoch shown here corresponds to
intensive merger activity and to the cold accretion growth in these simulations The corresponding
redshifts z  4 15 are shown in the lower-right corners of each frame Note the appearance of
ngers and shell structure inside and outside of the halo  much more pronounced in the presence
of baryons The inow containing both substructure and a smooth component is clearly visible as
a stream penetrating deeply inside the DM halo especially in the right-hand frames The shape
of the denser region is smashed against the vR-axis in the presence of baryons and has a convex
shape in the pure DM case The colours correspond to the DM volume density The vertical arrows
display instantaneous value of Rvir the dashed white line shows vR  0 and the solid blue line 
mass-averaged vR at each R The velocity axis is normalised by vcirc  the circular velocity at Rvir
from Romano-Daz et al 2009
 40 
substantially triaxial in the range of radii and hence vcirc provides a bad approximation to
the mass enclosed within r The overall symmetry in the rvcirc diagram eg Romano-Daz
et al 2009 conrms that there is very little net circulation of the DM within the halo The
tumbling of the halo gure is also found to be negligible  the halo appears to be orientated
along the main lament which feeds its growth
6 Disk growth feedback
Why is it that such a small fraction of baryons has been converted into stars over the
Hubble time Strong arguments exist as we have discussed in the previous sections that
an additional process which lowers the eciency of conversion of gas into stars must be
taken into account when considering the cosmological evolution of galaxies High-resolution
numerical simulations have demonstrated the necessity for this process Energy momentum
and mass deposition from stellar and AGN evolution can have a profound eect on the state
of the gas within Rvir when one considers a simple spherical geometry and their isotropic
deposition Whether this indeed happens when the geometry becomes more complex must be
veried This should be performed by including the by-products of any mechanical feedback
on various spatial scales stellar AGN and galactic winds as well as radiative feedback from
these objects and from the cosmological background radiation
A compelling example can be found in the comparison study of disk evolution in a
cosmological setting with and without feedback Section 21 see also Robertson et al
2004 where in the absence of feedback the gas quickly violates the Toomre criterion and
fragments Moreover without feedback there is an overproduction of metals especially in
small galaxies Even more revealing is the overcooling problem Section 21 which leads
directly to the angular momentum catastrophe and involves gas which is bound to the DM
substructures cools down and falls to the centre of the substructure The latter spirals in
to the inner parts of the parent DM halo losing its J via dynamical friction eg Maller 
Dekel 2002 and Fig 10 The gas therefore hitchhikes to the bottom of the potential well
without being ablated and is deposited there when the substructure is dissolved by the tidal
forces and possibly contributes to the growth of a classical bulge
Weak feedback has been tested conrming that such models overproduce the observed
baryonic mass function for galaxies especially for the most and least massive objects eg
Keres et al 2009b Various preventive feedbacks have been used to remove this discrep-
ancy such as a highly ecient AGN radio mode  this did not improve the t at the
high-mass end Furthermore it has been impossible to recover the population of massive
quiescent galaxies The overall conclusion is that the solution should come from a more
 41 
Fig 10 Sketch of the overcooling problem from Maller  Dekel 2002 Left gas cools
down and falls toward the centre of a satellite galaxy which is merging with the main DM
halo Dynamical friction accelerates the process The cold gas hitchhikes with the sinking
satellite and is losing its orbital J but is immune to stripping until the satellite falls to the
centre of the parent halo and dissolves there So gas overcooling leads to the J catastrophe
Section 2 Right The eect of overcooling on the spin distribution of baryons compared
to that of the DM Baryons lled curve being tightly bound at the satellite centre spiral
in with the satellite toward the inner parent halo and lose most of J The gure shows that
the J deciency in baryons is almost a factor of ten
sophisticated feedback mechanism which substantially suppresses the star formation in a
fraction of galaxies which increases with mass while leaving the star formation in the re-
maining galaxies unchanged
61 Bulgeless disks
Galactic bulges may provide a testing ground for our understanding of angular mo-
mentum redistribution in a forming disk and for various mechanisms that regulate the star
formation An unexpectedly large fraction 76 of massive  1010 M galactic disks can
be t with a Sersic index n  2 and 69 have a BT mass ratio of  02 both in barred
and unbarred galaxies Weinzirl et al 2009 This result has been obtained from ground-
 42 
Fig 11 Relative numbers of galaxies with classical bulges and elliptical galaxies red
lines galaxies with disky bulges ie pseudobulges blue line and all disky bulges black
dotted line as a function of galaxy stellar mass from Fisher  Drory 2011
based imaging of a local sample of 182 galaxies that covers all Hubble types S0aSm in
the optical and the NIR Disks inclined by i 70 have been excluded Two-dimensional
bulge-disk-bar decomposition has been performed on H-band images This result is in stark
contrast with predictions based on the numerical modelling of such objects  only disks that
did not experience a major merger event since z  2 are expected to have such low BT
ratios This number is more than an order of magnitude smaller than the observed fraction
of low BT disks Taken at face value this result points to a serious contradiction between
the observationally detected trend and our theoretical understanding and specically to the
role of major mergers in bulge formation
This contradiction becomes even stronger in the recent study of the bulge population
within a sphere of 11 Mpc radius using Spitzer 36 m and HST data Fisher  Drory
 43 
2011 The dominant galaxy type in the local Universe has been found to possess pure
disk properties ie having a disky bulge Section 32 or being bulgeless The fraction
of these galaxies exceeds 80 of the number of galaxies with a stellar mass of  109 M
Classical bulges and elliptical galaxies account for about 25 and disks for about 75 of
the total stellar mass within 11 Mpc Moreover 23 of the star formation in these galaxies
occurs in galaxies with disky bulges Figure 11 delineates the fractions of various bulge
types found as a function of stellar mass Below 3 109 M galaxies are most likely to be
bulgeless If disky bulges do not originate in mergers as we have discussed in Section 32
the results of this analysis reinforce those of Weinzirl et al 2009 in the most dramatic way
These results reinforce the opinion that additional physical processes are needed to
explain much less massive spheroidal components in disk galaxies
62 What type of feedback
Feedback or feed back is typically dened as a cause-and-response chain of events that
forms a causal loop The loop can be stable or unstable In simple terms in the former
case the process repeats itself and we dene it as a self-regulated one and the feedback
is negative In the latter case the initial conditions for the process are modied and the
system must nd a new stable loop or disintegrate In this case the feedback is positive
In the context of disk evolution positive or negative feedback can increase or decrease
the SFR in a disk The list of relevant mechanisms is not short and involves radiation
stellar and AGN winds stellar AGN galactic AGN jets and backow cocoons of large-
scale relativistic jets turbulence SN bubbles and superbubbles spiral density waves stellar
and gaseous bars and cold accretion along cosmological laments All the above mechanisms
can induce both positive and negative feedback on the SFR The disk response points to a
self-regulation achieved with respect to the star formation process
As we have discussed in Section 2 the absence of any feedback in disk evolution leads
to an overestimate of the spheroidal stellar component Hence additional processes must
regulate the fragmentation and star formation in disk galaxies The cause for this can lie
beyond the disk itself but fully understanding the disk response is crucial for predicting the
feedback loop
The physics of the various types of feedback is very complex and in many cases eg
AGN feedback not yet fully understood In some cases eg turbulence our understanding
is mostly empirical Moreover many relevant processes like star formation and turbulence
are well below the resolution limit of current numerical models of galaxy evolution in the
 44 
cosmological context and are therefore treated on the subgrid level ie purely phenomeno-
logically We rst discuss the main feedback mechanisms and then in Section 63 survey
the star formation and feedback algorithms used in numerical simulations
621 Supernova feedback
The simplest to model is gravitational feedback which involves collisional heating of the
gas It occurs during gas-rich mergers The collision-induced shocks help to virialise gas 
a process whose eciency depends on the orbits of the merger components Most aected
appears to be the low-density gas in the outer parts of the galaxy The fate of the gas
however is to remain largely bound to the merger product
The SN feedback or yield is probably the most analysed in the literature We follow
estimates by Dekel  Woo 2003 Kinetic energies are similar for type Ia and type II SNe
although Ia are irrelevant here as they deposit their energy away from the star formation
M from gas mass Mgas
sites A number of SN explosions resulting from a steady SFR of
embedded in the DM halo of Mvir can be estimated as
ESN   Mtrad
where  1051 erg is the initial energy released by a typical SN   5 1036 g1 is the
number of SNe per unit mass of stars for the Salpeter IMF   1 per 100 M of stars
and trad marks the end of the adiabatic phase and the onset of radiative phase in the
M  Mt
SN expansion The SFR can be written in terms of the free-fall time as
In the relevant range of gas temperatures a few  104 to a few
So ESN  Mtradt
 105 K the ratio tradt  102 is constant In order to expel unbind the amount of gas
Mgas from a galaxy which has virial velocity vvir the energy released by the SNe should be
ESN  05 Mgasv2
vir  the binding energy of this gas For this to happen the velocity of the gas
must exceed the critical velocity of vcrit  014 MMgas12  100 MMgas12 km s1 In
other words the gas can be removed from DM haloes with virial velocities vvir  vcrit  100 km s1
if a large fraction say M  Mgas of the gas is turned into stars
The associated DM virial mass which supports the formation of M of stellar mass for
such vvir is Mvir  2 1011 M and the corresponding stellar mass M  34 1010 M in
apparent agreement with the bifurcation mass for bimodal evolution discussed in Section 52
So the SN feedback can reheat the ISM push it into the halo and even expel a large frac-
tion of the gas from smaller galaxies One SN can in principle unbind a giant molecular
cloud The above estimate makes it plausible that the gas can be driven out of a galaxy by
the SN feedback if a large fraction of the original gas has been converted into stars But
 45 
SNe are not very ecient in converting the stellar rest mass into kinetic energy because
fSN  100 Mc2  28 106 While progress has been made in high-resolution hydrody-
namical simulations of SN shells sweeping up the ISM the details are not clear yet especially
how eciently the energy is distributed among the baryons
622 OB stellar winds and AGN feedback
Stellar winds from OB stars are driven by radiation pressure in UV resonance lines of
CNO elements and inject about the same amount of kinetic energy over their lifetime as
SNe The asymptotic velocities of these winds are 20003000 km s1 On the subgrid level
these winds from individual stars have been incorporated into numerical simulations Heller
 Shlosman 1994 Understanding the formation of galactic winds under a combined action
of OB stars and SNe is more complicated
AGN winds originate within the central pc  kpc region from the SMBH and are energy-
andor momentum-driven We limit our discussion here to sub-relativistic winds in radio-
quiet QSOs only and exclude the jets The mechanisms responsible for these winds are based
on radiation power or are hydromagnetically MHD driven from the underlying accretion
disk eg Blandford  Payne 1982 Shlosman et al 1985 Emmering et al 1992 Konigl
 Kartje 1994 The former can be driven by absorption scattering in the resonance
lines similar to those in OB stars and by the dust opacity The MHD winds can feed
on the rotational energy of the disk Note that the MHD winds are much more ecient in
extracting the angular momentum from the underlying accretion disks Unlike the radiation-
driven winds they can reduce the mass accretion rate substantially  the mass outow rate
in an MHD wind can exceed the inow rate for some period of time At the same time
magnetic torques can extract the angular momentum from the disk without much of the
outow at all This cannot be achieved with the radiatively-driven winds  in order to
extract angular momentum from the disk they must maintain a very high mass ux in
the wind Because this is beyond the scope of our review we avoid discussing here the
magnetorotational instability MRI which can generate turbulence and transport J within
the disk
Outows with clear signatures in UV and optical emission and absorption lines and in
the radio have been known for a long time But reliable measurements of a mass outow
rate has been obtained only recently eg for a broad absorption line QSO SDSS J0318-
0600 at 120 M yr1 Dunn et al 2010 The kinetic luminosity for this object has been
estimated at 0001 of its bolometric luminosity at the lower end of assessments available in
the literature Powerful molecular outows from AGN have been detected with a mechanical
 46 
luminosity estimated from a few to 100 of the AGN bolometric luminosity eg Reeves
et al 2009 This means that they cannot be driven by SNe but require a higher eciency
associated with radiatively-driven winds or most probably with MHD winds It also means
that such outows will deplete the in situ reservoir of molecular gas in a relatively short
time The molecular tori observed in type 2 AGN in the NIR can represent the base of such
molecular outows Elitzur  Shlosman 2006
What is the AGN analogue of the SN feedback eciency or yield fSN estimated above
The total energy EAGN produced by an AGN depends on the conversion factor AGN  01
of its accretion energy ie EAGN  AGNMc2 where   1031 is the conversion factor of
the bolometric luminosity Lbol of the AGN into mechanical luminosity and M is the mass
of the central SMBH The exact value of  is not known and it is expected to depend on the
nature of the major contributor to Lbol on the ratio of Lbol to the Eddington luminosity
and possibly on additional parameters of the ow We therefore leave  unconstrained and
note that in the epoch of galaxy formation at high redshift which can be characterised by
plentiful fuel supply and high Eddington ratios for the AGN the value of  can be as high
as 1 Moreover if we assume for brevity that the M   relation is maintained at these
redshifts quite unlikely MM  103 and
EAGN  104cid16AGN
01 cid17 Mc2
which means that the eciency of the high-z AGN is fAGN  104 This estimate can be
about 1050 times higher than fSN but remains speculative
The rst serious attempt to account for AGN feedback in high-resolution numerical
simulations used purely thermal feedback and no delivery or coupling mechanisms were
specied Springel 2005 A fraction of the isotropic bolometric luminosity of the AGN has
been assumed to be deposited locally Momentum transfer has been ignored Application of
this feedback resulted in limiting the growth of the SMBH and expulsion of the ISM from the
galaxy Less realistic but more detailed simulations have shown that the momentum transfer
dominates because of the very short cooling timescales and the inability to retain thermal
energy in the dense gas found in galactic centres eg Ostriker et al 2010 This is also
symptomatic of OB stellar winds and winds from accretion disks with eective temperatures
in the UV
So AGN can have a potentially dramatic eect on the ISM and IGM based on their
energy output If this energy momentum and mass around the SMBHs were distributed in
a highly symmetric fashion this could ensure an ecient coupling with baryons However
besides direct evidence in the form of collimated jet-ISMIGM interaction in radio galaxies
both in X-rays and radio bands and in clusters of galaxies additional evidence is scarce
 47 
Furthermore the relevant physics of AGN output deposition in baryons is still poorly un-
derstood How exactly is the coupling to baryons achieved Even when the feedback energy
exceeds the gas binding energy the gas can escape along the preferential directions or via
the uidised bed-type phase transition dramatically reducing the feedback
While models based on energy- and momentum-driven outows have been proposed
these are mostly phenomenological models The detailed physics of energy and momentum
deposition is under investigation now as well as attempts to translate it into subgrid physics
The important issues involve the driving mechanisms for the wind their dependence on mass
accretion ows on Eddington ratio geometric beaming and additional factors
623 Galactic winds
While at present there are still theoretical diculties with almost any type of wind
from any object eg star accretion disk these winds nevertheless exist and there are clear
incentives in working out the corollaries of this existence The presence of galactic outows
is supported by numerous observations eg Heckman 1994 and references therein
most cases they are driven by the SNe and winds from OB stars in galaxies that experience
starbursts The contribution of AGN is debatable at present The driving by the SNe and
stellar winds occurs when ejecta of individual sources form a bubble of hot gas 1078 K
which expands due to the strong overpressure down the steepest pressure gradient and enters
the blow-out stage Besides the mass energy and momentum injected by such winds this is
probably the main way the highly-enriched material can be injected into the halo and further
out into the IGM The winds appear inhomogeneous and carry embedded cold 104 K clouds
with them so they represent a multiphase ISM Their velocities appear correlated with the
galaxy stellar mass or its SFR eg Martin 2005
The overall energetics of these bubbles and superbubbles points to the important and
even crucial role galactic winds play in galaxy evolution from determining the size of galactic
disks to regulating the star formation process in galaxies and removing the overcooling
problem discussed earlier In this context the overcooling results from under-resolved ISM
which will radiate away all the thermal energy deposited by the feedback The proper
resolution must correctly treat the merging of individual SN bubbles producing low-density
superbubbles which will remain hot for a prolonged period of time  this resolution is not
yet achievable in cosmological or individual-galaxy numerical simulations Only when small
volumes representing a region in the disk are modelled these processes can be followed To
summarise any modelling of galaxy formation and evolution must include the development
of galactic outows triggered either by stellar or AGN feedback
 48 
To circumvent this lack of numerical resolution the necessary physics can be introduced
on the subgrid level We discuss four such algorithms the constant velocity the delayed
cooling the blastwave and the variable wind models
 Constant wind model Springel  Hernquist 2003 Springel 2005
This wind model is based on a multiphase ISM treatment Two phases cold and
hot are not directly resolved but coexist in a single SPH particle So dynamically
they cannot be separated The two phases are followed above the critical gas density
which corresponds to the threshold SF above which the star formation is allowed to
occur The SNe directly heat the ambient hot phase whose cooling timescale is long
This eectively modies the equation of state for the ISM The cold phase is heated
and evaporated via thermal conduction from the hot phase Mass-transfer equations
between the two ISM phases are solved analytically The galactic wind is triggered
by modifying the behaviour of some gas particles into the wind particles The wind
particles are not subject to hydrodynamical forces and experience the initial kick from
the SN All wind particles have the same constant velocity and the same mass-loading
factor w  Mw MSF where Mw is the mass loss in the wind and MSF is the SFR The
observational constraints on the value of the loading factor w are weak
 Delayed cooling wind model Thacker  Couchman 2000 Heller et al 2007b
The energy injection by the SN and OB stellar winds aects the xed number of neigh-
bouring SPH particles This process is resolved by at least ve timesteps and extends
to tin  3 107 yr  the feedback timescale Radiative cooling is disabled for these
neighbours The SN energy is deposited in the form of thermal energy and converted
into kinetic energy via an equation of motion and using the energy thermalisation pa-
rameter The aected particles do not interact hydrodynamically over the time period
which depends on the minimum of tin and the time it takes for the wind particle to
move to an ambient density below some threshold density
 Blastwave wind model Stinson et al 2006
This model is based on the adiabatic Sedov-Taylor and snowplough phases in the
SN expansion The blastwave is generated by the collective explosion of many SNe of
type II The maximum radius of the blastwave is given by the Chevalier 1974 and
McKee  Ostriker 1977 formalism Radiative cooling is disabled for R Rblast The
timescale for the blastwave to reach this radius is of the order of a timestep resolution
The blastwave wind model has been ecient in moving the peak of the star formation
to lower redshifts well beyond the last major merger and has signicantly reduced
the SFR during mergers due to the feedback in progenitors
 49 
 Variable wind model Choi  Nagamine 2011
This model adopts the subgrid multiphase ISM All the previous algorithms have loaded
galactic winds with star-forming particles and their close neighbours only In this model
particles from low-densityhigh-temperature and high-densitylow-temperature are se-
lected The main parameters are chosen as the wind load w dened above and the wind
velocity vw and both are constrained by observations Typically observations express
these two parameters in terms of the host galaxy stellar mass M and the SFR This
requires that simulations compute both parameters on the y as the model is running
and not in the post-processing stage which is challenging In the original version the
outer density of baryons in a galaxy is limited by 001 nSF where nSF  00101 cm3
dened above is the threshold for star formation The value of nSF is based on the
translation of the threshold surface density in the Kennicutt-Schmidt law SFR 
where SFR is the disk surface density of star formation gas is the surface density of
the neutral gas and  12 depending on the tracers used and on the relevant linear
scales
In the variable wind model the wind velocity is calculated as a fraction of the escape
speed from the host DM halo vw  vesc where   15 for momentum-driven and   1
for energy-driven winds is a scaling factor The SFR is determined from the empirical
relation with vesc
SFR  10 cid16

M yr1
which is consistent with observations eg Martin 2005 Hence the wind velocity
is an increasing function of redshift and the SFR The load factor w is assumed to
represent the energy-driven wind in the low-density case n  nSF and the momentum-
driven wind for n  nSF
63 Feedback and star formation
The physics of isolated stellar gaseous and gasstars disks have been analysed exten-
sively over the last few decades by means of analytic methods and numerical simulations
The parallel study of galaxy evolution in a cosmological setting placed emphasis on the initial
conditions and on the fact that galaxies are open systems that can exchange mass momen-
tum and energy with their environment Under these conditions the rate of secular evolution
can be dramatically accelerated and the direction of this evolution altered signicantly The
approximation that galaxies are in dynamical equilibrium remains except during the merger
events
 50 
Probably the most important corollary of studying galaxies in cosmology is narrowing
the range of initial conditions and requiring that the evolution complies with them Un-
derstanding that early disks have been much more gas-rich than disk galaxies in the local
Universe brings about the natural question of what prevented the full conversion of this gas
into stars over the Hubble time This can be achieved either by keeping the gas at low den-
sities or high temperatures to prevent the Jeans instability from developing However it is
dicult to maintain low densities when the gas assembles in disks unless strong deposition
of momentum energy or both expels the gas from the disk
Most of the prescriptions for star formation can be followed from Katz 1992 with
some modications and involve the Jeans instability An additional constraint introduces
the critical volume density for star formation nSF which corresponds to the total Hi  H2
atomic and molecular hydrogen surface density threshold in the Kennicutt-Schmidt K-S
law SF  310 M pc2 eg Schaye  Dalla Vecchia 2008 However new observational
evidence points to a considerable dispersion in the values of the threshold surface density
SF and the slope  as well as to a substantial steepening of the K-S law above z  3 eg
Gnedin  Kravtsov 2011 and references therein A growing body of evidence points to a
dependence of the SFR on the surface density of the molecular hydrogen rather than on the
total surface density of the neutral hydrogen
An intriguing question is whether the Jeans instability in the neutral gas triggers the
formation of H2 or whether it is the formation of H2 that triggers the Jeans instability
and subsequent gravitational collapse Current eorts focus on understanding the various
factors which regulate the formation and destruction of H2 such as dust abundance and
metallicity UV background gravitational instabilities facilitating the gas cooling etc A
fully self-consistent model of the molecular gas balance in the ISM will be developed in the
next few years
We have discussed the mechanisms that are responsible for the feedback from stellar and
AGN evolution and pointed out the importance of understanding the ways in which energy
and momentum are distributed among the ISM and the IGM While the sources of energy
and momentum operate on very small scales  1 pc compared to characteristic galactic
scalelengths and scaleheights  1 kpc they are deposited on much larger scales and can
have a global eect In addition there is broad agreement between observations theory and
numerical simulations that the multiphase ISM is required to treat the feedback properly
One possibility for progress in this direction lies in a further increase of the spatial
resolution of numerical models to an extent that at least part of the subgrid physics is in
fact simulated eg turbulent cells in the ISM Sub-50 pc resolution has shown the formation
of hot SN bubbles superbubbles and chimneys in tandem with turbulent ows there eg
 51 
Fig 12 Eect of density threshold on star formation Left a low-density threshold  a
single massive star formation region exists Right a high-density threshold In the latter
case a much smaller region becomes Jeans-unstable and a number of smaller star formation
sites exist resulting in lower star formation eciencies when averaged over all phases of the
Ceverino  Klypin 2009 Galactic winds develop naturally under these conditions without
additional ad hoc assumptions Unfortunately such resolution is dicult to achieve in
present-day fully self-consistent cosmological simulations
Another by-product of high-resolution modelling is the possibility of using a much higher
threshold for star formation than usual corresponding to molecular gas The eect of going
to higher critical densities for star formation is shown in Fig 12 and results in lower star
formation eciencies when averaged over all phases of the ISM A proper treatment of the
cold gas phase is also crucial in order to account for dissipation in supersonic ows
fact in order to reproduce the observed log-normal probability density function PDF in
the ISM it is necessary to resolve the broad density range and in particular to resolve the
critical density of 105 times that of the average density in the ISM eg Elmegreen 2002
This requirement in tandem with the ISM heating by gravitational instabilities leads to
self-regulation when turbulence limits the eciency of the star formation process
Gas-rich disks are prone to fragmentation  the so-called Toomre 1964 instability The
idea of a marginally gravitationally stable gaseous disk was originally proposed by Paczynski
1978 who specically considered the case of turbulence driven by gravitational instabilities
in a disk that was able to cool below Q 1 The resulting turbulent gravitational viscosity
 52 
was found to be responsible for the disk re-heating angular momentum transfer and inow
Analysis and numerical simulations of isolated two-component gasstars disks indeed have
demonstrated the formation of massive clumps that migrate to the centre and heat up the
stellar component as a result of dynamical friction in agreement with analytical estimates
Shlosman  Noguchi 1993 Noguchi 1999 The characteristic timescale for spiraling in
toward the central kpc is about a couple of orbital periods Noguchi 1999 further argued
that these clumps contribute to the buildup of galactic bulges
The developing massive clumps will migrate to the centre over a few dynamical times
while maintained in a marginally stable state with Toomres Q 1 and contribute there to
the bulge growth eg Dekel at al 2009a In reality it is not trivial to stabilise the self-
gravitating clumps against runaway star formation Dekel et al propose that gravitational
interactions between the clumps will also induce turbulence inside the clumps which will
stabilise them against gravitational collapse over the spiralling-in timescale  an interesting
possibility so far not veried
In the cosmological context
including star formation these clumps
in addition to
forming in the disk itself can be supplied by the incoming ows from cosmological laments
Heller et al 2007b Dekel et al 2009a Ceverino et al 2010 The clumps did however
show vigorous star formation Rather than being supported by clump-clump interactions
Heller et al
found that the feedback from stellar evolution has provided support for the
clumps while some of them have been sheared andor collisionally destroyed before they
entered the central kpc Moreover the energymomentum feedback parameter has been
varied and the clumps have appeared earlier and have been more numerous in models where
this feedback has been smaller The nal bulge-to-disk mass ratio has also shown a clear
anti-correlation with the amount of the feedback Hence as shown by Heller et al en-
ergymomentum feedback inside the gas-rich disk delays its fragmentation and at the same
time decreases the star-forming activity inside these massive clumps
Internal turbulent
pressure in massive self-gravitating clumps can indeed play the role of delaying the star for-
mation but it is not clear whether it can be driven by the outside turbulence in the disk
The possible internal drivers of turbulence can be their gravitational collapse and energy
input from newly formed massive stars and SNe
Dense molecular clouds in the ISM form via supersonic turbulence in the ISM The su-
personic velocities decrease on smaller scales as v  scale05 Larson 1981 and may represent
a turbulent eld dominated by shocks This result is supported by numerical simulations
of supersonic turbulence and by analytical calculations eg Padoan  Nordlund 2002
and references therein with the possible extention to include the cloud column density
v  05 scale05 Ballesteros-Paredes et al 2011 The velocity-scale relation may deter-
 53 
mine the characteristic scale for gravitational instabilities and sites for star formation The
turbulent driving comes from the larger scales and dissipation occurs within the clouds Re-
cent results show that turbulent motions inside molecular clouds are driven by gravitational
collapse eg Ballesteros-Paredes et al 2011
7 High-redshift galaxies
The epoch of galaxy formation follows the end of the Dark Ages when baryons could
start to accumulate within the DM haloes and star formation was triggered The scope of
this review does not allow us to go into the details of this fascinating subject Here we shall
focus on galaxy evolution during the reionisation epoch at redshifts z  612 We shall not
discuss the formation and evolution of the Population III stars either which has been largely
completed by the onset of the reionisation process except maybe in low-density regions
Section 8 will touch upon some aspects of SMBH formation in 108 M DM haloes All the
problems discussed in the previous sections remain relevant at these high redshifts
The rapidly increasing list of objects above z  6 makes it possible to study the popu-
lation of galaxies during reionisation Deep imaging in multiband surveys using the Wide
Field Camera 3 WFC3 on the HST as well as some ground-based observations using 8 m
telescopes have revealed galaxies via absorption at wavelengths shorter than Ly from the
intervening neutral hydrogen eg Bouwens et al 2010 In many cases these photometric
redshifts could be veried spectroscopically up to z  7 eg Pentericci et al 2011 The
majority of reionisation-epoch galaxies are faint but much rarer brighter galaxies have also
been identied at z  8 by means of a large-area medium-deep HST survey Brightest of
Reionizing Galaxies BoRG along random lines of sight including the candidate for the
most distant protocluster Trenti et al 2011 Even fainter galaxies have been found using
gravitational lensing by massive galaxy clusters
71 The high-redshift galaxy zoo
One of the most successful methods to search for reionisation-epoch galaxies is the
dropout method based on the absorption short of some characteristic wavelength the 912 A
Lyman break and a smaller break at Ly 1216 A which originate in the intervening neutral
hydrogen eg Steidel et al 1996 Using multiwavelength imaging and lters objects
disappear drop out when a particular and progressively redder lter is applied The
resulting break in the continuum spectrum allows us to determine the photometric redshift
 54 
of the object For z  6 the break lies at 8500 A This technique has been applied rst to
U-band dropouts  galaxies that lack ux in the U-band z  3 then to g-band dropouts
z  4 The choice of the lter determines the targeted redshift Additional dropouts have
been named according to the relevant bands i775 z  6 z850 z  7 Y z  89 and J
z  10 Existing data from NICMOS GOODSACS and UDF can reveal dropouts up to
z  10 The population of detected galaxies has already provided substantial constraints on
the galaxy growth in the Universe at that epoch
The expanding classication of high-z galaxies has its origin in diverse observational
techniques used for their detection and study resembling the early stages of AGN classica-
tion before unication Galaxies that exhibit a break in the Lyman continuum redshifted to
the UV and other bands have been called Lyman break galaxies LBGs Complementary to
continuum-selected surveys the Ly galaxies or so-called Ly emitters LAEs have been
mostly detected in narrow-band imaging surveys Such surveys typically miss the LBGs
because of the faint continuum Spectroscopic identication of z  6 LBGs is only possible
if they have strong Ly emission and are bright eg Vanzella et al 2011
An important question is what is the relationship between various classes of high-z
galaxy populations and what are their low-z counterparts Especially interesting is their re-
lationship to sub-mm galaxies found at z  15 These sub-mm galaxies have been detected
in the 200 m  1 mm band via redshifted dust emission using the Sub-mm Common-User
Bolometer Array SCUBA camera These objects have a negative K-correction2 because
the Rayleigh-Jeans RJ tail of the Planck blackbody distribution Galaxies in the RJ tail be-
come brighter with redshift They are generally not SBGs because of the weak UV emission
The sub-mm galaxy population consists of very luminous objects with bolometric luminosity
101213 L emitted mostly in the IR Powered by intense starbursts their estimated SFRs
are 1023 M yr1
72 Mass and luminosity functions
Observations of z  6 galaxies have shown a rapidly evolving galactic LF which agrees
with the predicted DM halo mass function eg Bouwens et al 2011 The UV LF of LBGs
has been established with its faint end exhibiting a very steep slope eg Bouwens et al
2007 Using the Schechter function t L  LLLexpLL the faint end of
this LF at z  7 has the slope of  177 020 and   14 103 Mpc3 mag1 which
is consistent with no evolution over the time span of z  27 eg Oesch et al 2010 The
2The K-correction is the dimming of a source due to the 1  z shift of the wavelength band and its width
 55 
Fig 13 UV LFs for z  4 6 8 and projected LF at z  10 Oesch et al 2012 The z  10
LF extrapolated from ts to lower-redshift LBG LFs is shown as a dashed red line see also the
text For comparison the z  4 and z  6 LFs are plotted showing the dramatic buildup of UV
luminosity across 1 Gyr of cosmic time The light-grey vectors along the lower axis indicate the
range of luminosities over which the dierent data sets dominate the z  10 LF constraints
bright end of the LF evolves signicantly over this time period An even steeper faint end
of the LF  198 023 has been claimed recently Trenti 2012 The SFR appears to
decline rapidly with increasing redshift So by z  6 the number of ionising photons is just
enough to keep the Universe ionised and most of them come from objects fainter than the
current detection limit of the HST eg Oesch et al 2010 Trenti et al 2010 Trenti 2012
An accelerated evolution of galaxies during reionisation has been predicted and observed
eg Bouwens et al 2007 2010 Trenti et al 2010 Lacey et al 2011 Oesch et al 2010
2012 Strong evolution is expected for z  810 by about a factor of 25 The estimated
number of z  10 galaxies has been derived from the observed LF at z  6 and 8 Fig 13
Using this LF six objects are expected to be present in the eld at z  10 but only one has
 56 
Fig 14 Evolution of the UV LD above M1400 18 mag  006 Lz  3 Oesch et al 2012
The lled circle at z  104 is the LD directly measured for the galaxy candidate The red line
corresponds to the empirical LF evolution Its extrapolation to z  8 is shown as a dashed red line
been detected Hence the LF appears to drop even faster than expected from the previous
empirical lower-redshift extrapolation The resulting accelerated LF evolution in the range
of z  810 has been estimated at  94 signicance level Oesch et al 2012
An important conclusion from the above studies has been the realisation that the UV
luminosity density LD originating in the high-z galaxy population levels o and gradually
falls toward higher z in the range z  38 Fig 14 The LD data at z  48 are taken
from Bouwens et al 2007 and Bouwens et al 2011 As can be seen in Fig 14 the LD
increases by more than an order of magnitude in 170 Myr from z  10 to 8 indicating that
the galaxy population at this luminosity range evolves by a factor  4 more than expected
from low-redshift extrapolations The predicted LD evolution of the semi-analytical model
of Lacey et al 2011 is shown as a dashed blue line and the prediction from theoretical
modelling Trenti et al 2010 is shown as a blue solid line These reproduce the expected
LD at z  10 remarkably well
A strong decline in the LF beyond z  8 has corollaries for the reionisation by the more
 57 
luminous galaxies at this epoch as the number of luminous sources appears insucient for
this process These data point clearly to a strong evolution of the galaxy population but
what is the cause of this evolution
Analysis and modelling of the available data point to the underlying cause the accel-
erated evolution is driven by changes in the DM halo mass function HMF as follows from
theoretical considerations eg Trenti et al 2010 and semi-analytical modelling eg Lacey
et al 2011 and not by the star formation processes in these galaxies Interestingly the
rapid assembly of haloes at z  810 alone can explain the LF evolution Trenti et al 2010
However this assumption has never been put to a self-consistent test using high-resolution
simulations with the relevant baryon physics The possible link between LF and the DM
HMF has been studied by means of the conditional LF method eg Trenti et al 2010
and references therein to understand the processes regulating star formation The main
conclusions can be summarised as 1 a signicant redshift evolution of galaxy luminosity vs
halo mass LgalMh 2 only a fraction 2030 appear to host LBGs and 3 the LF for
z  6 deviates from the Schechter functional form in particular by missing the sharp drop
in density of luminous M 20 galaxies with L For example due to the short timescales
 z  1 corresponds to  170 Mpc  it becomes dicult to rely on the fast evolution of
LgalMh while Mh evolves rapidly at these redshifts
Due to the nature of the hierarchical growth of structure high-z galaxies should ap-
pear and grow fastest in the highest overdensities and therefore are expected to be strongly
clustered around the density peaks For example Trenti et al 2012 infer the properties
of DM haloes in the BoRG 58 eld at z  8 based on the found ve Y098-dropouts using
the Improved Conditional Luminosity Function model The brightest member of the asso-
ciated overdensity appears to reside in a halo of 47 2 1011 M  a 5  density peak
which corresponds to a comoving space density of 915 107 Mpc3 It has 2070
chance of being present within the volume probed by the BoRG survey Using an extended
Press-Schechter function about 48 haloes more massive than 1011 M are expected in the
associated region with the comoving radius of 155 Mpc compared to less than 103 in the
random region For higher accuracy a set of 10 cosmological simulations Romano-Daz et
al 2011a has been used tailored to study high-z galaxy formation in such an over-dense
environment A DM mass resolution of 3 108 M has been used and therefore haloes
with masses  1011 M have been well resolved The constrained realisation CR method
eg Bertschinger 1987 Homan  Ribak 1991 Romano-Daz et al 2007 2009 2011ab
has been instrumental in modelling these rare over-dense regions We describe this method
The CR method consists of a series of linear constraints on the initial density eld used
 58 
to design prescribed initial conditions
It is not an approximation but an exact method
All the constraints are of the same form  the value of the initial density eld at dierent
locations and are evaluated with dierent Gaussian smoothing kernels with their width
xed so as to encompass the mass scale on which a constraint is imposed The set of mass
scales and the location at which the constraints are imposed dene the numerical experiment
Assuming a cosmological model and power spectrum of the primordial perturbation eld a
random realisation of the eld is constructed from which a CR is generated The additional
use of the zoom-in technique assures that the high-resolution region of simulations is subject
to large-scale gravitational torques The CRs provide a unique tool to study high-z galaxies
at an unprecedented resolution It allows one to use much smaller cosmological volumes
and without any loss of generality accounts for the cosmic variance
The initial conditions for the test runs described above have been constrained to have a
halo of mass 1012 M by z  6 This halo has reached 5 1011 M by z  8 in compliance
with BoRG 58-17871420 Within the eld of view of 70  70 and the redshift depth of
z  19 Mpc about 64 haloes more massive than 1011 M have been expected and the
highest number found in the simulations was 10 Fig 15 A random unconstrained re-
gion of the same volume has been estimated to host 0013 such haloes The probability
of contamination in such a small area is negligible 25 104 In summary if indeed the
brightest member of the BoRG 58 eld lives in a massive DM halo the fainter dropouts de-
tected in this eld are part of the overdensity that contributes to the protocluster depending
of course on spectroscopic conrmation Simulations provide some insight into the fate of
this overdensity with a total DM mass of 12 1013 M  it has collapsed by z  3 and
is expected to grow to 12 1014 M by z  0
The evolution of the HMF is very sensitive to the assumed cosmology because the
halo growth rate depends on the average matter density in the Universe As the DM is not
observable directly numerical simulations are indispensable in studying the halo growth and
analytic techniques provide an additional tool The process of DM halo formation quickly
becomes non-linear which makes an analytical follow-up dicult Analytically one relies
on modelling the spherical or ellipsoidal collapses but only N-body simulations reveal the
complexity of the process which is hierarchical in Nature Numerically the halo growth
depends on the force resolution used and on the size of the computational box The N-body
simulations of halo evolution are very accurate 1 and the analytical methods are 10
20 eg Press  Schechter 1974 Bond et al 1991 Nevertheless the analytical HMF can
reproduce the numerical results at least qualitatively and can be dened3 as dndM where
3A variety of denitions of the HMF exist in the literature We use the dierential HMF

Discrepancies between the analytically derived and numerically obtained HMFs can be
sucient to aect our understanding of galaxy growth during the reionisation epoch as
shown in Fig 16 Lukic et al 2007 It is therefore important that the shape of the HMF

8 Disk evolution the central kpc and the SMBHs
A wealth of issues dominate our understanding of the central regions in galaxies and
their role in the overall galaxy evolution on cosmological timescales  the secular evolution
But is there a dynamically distinct central kiloparsec region in galaxies The answer appears
to be positive as a major resonance between the bar andor spiral arm pattern speed p
on the one hand and the linear combination of the epicyclic frequency  and the angular
velocity  on the other is positioned in this area ie
p   
Incidentally the right-hand side of this relation represents the precession frequency of stellar
orbits The resonance between the orbit precession frequency and the pattern speed is
called the inner Lindblad resonance ILR A multiple number of ILRs can exist in the
neighbourhood but typically their number does not exceed two The ILRs if they are not
saturated dampen the propagation of waves in the stellar uid This resonance can trigger
various processes in the region eg gas accumulation in the form of nuclear rings nuclear
starbursts nuclear bars etc Shlosman 1999 and references therein The ILRs can pump
the kinetic orbital energy into vertical stellar motions So while there are naturally strong
interactions between the inner and outer disks dierent processes dominate both regions
The next question is whether there is a morphologically distinct central kiloparsec region
in galaxies The answer is positive again  the ILRs acts as separators between the inner
and outer disk resulting in detached bars and spiral patterns The inner region is generally
dominated by the bulge and hosts the SMBH
A number of important issues which also include the inner kpc directly or indirectly
are discussed by Lia Athanassoula and James Binney this volume We shall attempt to
avoid unnecessary overlap although some overlap is actually welcomed In the discussion
below we shall focus therefore on various asymmetries in the mass distribution that drive
the evolution such as disk and halo asymmetries large-scale stellar bars briey and the
dynamics of nested bars In Section 82 we shall touch on the issues related to the formation
and evolution of SMBHs at high redshifts We have already reviewed to some extent the
feedback from AGN in Section 6 The immediate environment of the SMBHs eg the role
of molecular tori is beyond the scope of this discussion
Two types of torques can have a dramatic eect on the dynamics within the central kpc
 62 
namely magnetic and gravitational torques The former can dominate the central 110 pc
from the SMBHs while the latter can have an eect outside this region on scales of  few
tens of parsecs Viscous torques can be important near the major resonances and can be
neglected in other regions in comparison with magnetic and gravitational torques
81 Bars and the morphology of the central kpc
Stellar bars can be formed either as a result of a spontaneous break of axial symmetry 
the so-called bar instability eg Hohl 1971 or via tidal interaction between galaxies eg
Noguchi 1988 or between galaxies and DM subhaloes eg Romano-Daz et al 2008b
Stellar bars themselves are subject to dynamical instabilities and secular evolution which
aect the disk as well Of these we shall single out the vertical buckling instability eg
Combes et al 1990 This instability has both dynamical and secular aspects Dynamically
this instability exhibits a spontaneous break of the equatorial symmetry in the rz plane
eg Pfenniger  Friedli 1991 Raha et al 1991 The action of the vertical ILR eectively
converts the rotational kinetic energy of the star in the disk into vertical oscillations This
results in a vertical thickening of the stellar disk at radii smaller than the position of the
vertical ILR and in the appearance of a characteristic peanutboxy-shaped bulge The
symmetry is always restored on the dynamical timescale eg Fig 17 note the ip-ow
at 2324 Gyr Moreover if the equatorial symmetry is articially imposed this bulge
nevertheless appears although on a longer timescale and driven by the same resonance
What the low-resolution simulations have failed to capture and what has been obtained
by Martnez-Valpuesta et al 2006 for the rst time is the recurrent break in the equatorial
symmetry occurring on a much slower timescale of a few Gyr around 5275 Gyr This slow
buildup of the bar asymmetry long after the rst vertical buckling occurred is rooted in the
secular evolution of stellar orbits driven by the low-order vertical resonances Unlike the
rst buckling the second phase displays persistent asymmetry The Fourier amplitude of
the symmetry breaking decreases with the next stage of the instability
About 50 of edge-on disks show peanutboxy bulges Martnez-Valpuesta et al 2006
and references therein which appear to be a clear signature of stellar bars While we do
understand the reasons for the dynamical stage of the buckling instability we cannot predict
the onset of the second secular stage of this instability Models with a gas component show
that the amplitude of this instability decreases with increasing gas fraction Berentzen et al
1998 2007

811 Nested bars observational perspective
Getting rid of the angular momentum is a major issue for astrophysical systems eg
Sections 2 and 3 Given that a substantial mass is involved gravitational torques appear
as the most ecient mechanism for redistribution of angular momentum on various spatial
scales The formation of disks therefore is a reection of the ineciency of this process
Gravitational torques are triggered by a non-axisymmetric distribution of matter The most
frequent asymmetry in the disk is in the form of spiral arms which lead to torques with an
amplitude of 1  a quasilinear perturbation if dened as a ratio of tangential to radial
acceleration On the other hand bars are strongly non-linear perturbations on the level
of 10100 The importance of bars at least after z  1 is reected in the existence of
the branch of barred galaxies in the Hubble fork although the exact statistics is still being
debated eg Jogee et al 2004 Sheth et al 2008
But the eciency of bars in extracting angular momentum for example from the gas
is limited by a decade in radius due to a strong decay in the gravitational multipole inter-
actions Shlosman et al 1989 1990 So it is only natural that bars repeat themselves on
progressively smaller scales In retrospect it is not surprising that such bizarre systems of
nested bars exist in Nature
The rst known observation of a system with nested bars has been performed on
NGC 1291 classied as an SB0a galaxy Evans 1951 An inner twist of the optical isophote
has barely been detected and explained as an inner spiral A much later observation of this
object resulted in a large-scale bar of 99 kpc and a nuclear bar of 18 kpc misaligned at
30 with the inner bar leading the outer bar de Vaucouleurs 1975 A question has been
asked on whether the presence of a second bar in NGC 1291 is an oddity of Nature or is
a fairly common perhaps typical structural feature De Vaucouleurs concluded that the
lens-bar-nucleus structure on two dierent scales in barred lenticular galaxies is probably not
rare and raises an interesting problem in the dynamics of stellar systems but did not follow
up on this issue A morphological survey of 121 barred galaxies has revealed additional
objects with inner structure misaligned with the outer bar but this has been interpreted as
a bulge distorted by the large-scale bar Kormendy 1979 In a subsequent study Kormendy
1982 has analysed bulge rotation in barred galaxies and summed up that the kinematics of
these triaxial bulges is similar to those of bars while the light distribution is as in elliptical
galaxies All these bars have been stellar in origin Their mutual interactions have not been
discussed and they have not been considered as a dynamically coupled system Shlosman
1989 1990 have suggested that nuclear bars can be of multiple types and that
nested bars form a new dynamically coupled system which redistributes angular momentum
in galaxies
 65 
In principle nested bars can be of a few types
stellarstellar stellargaseous and
gaseousgaseous The rst two types have been observed now while the third type has not
yet been observed4 In addition we do not count as a separate class stellar nested bars which
are gas-rich or vice versa
The rst catalogues of double-barred galaxies have been published recently Laine et al
2002 used an HST sample of 112 galaxies in the H-band Erwin  Sparke 2002 analysed
a sample of 38 galaxies in the optical and Erwin 2004 considered 67 galaxies mostly
from Laine et al The main conclusion of these studies has been that about 25 5 of
all disk galaxies host nested bars and about 13 of barred disks possess secondary bars
These numbers show decisively that galaxies with nested stellar bars are not a marginal
phenomenon but form an important class of dynamical systems
Molecular gas is abundant in galactic centres but it is not clear what fraction of this
gas is in a barred state While there have been surveys of molecular gas within the central
 kpc the available resolution was insucient for the detection of nuclear gaseous bars
Some nearby galaxies host gaseous bars eg IC 342 NGC 2273 NGC 2782 Circinus etc
but their statistical signicance is not clear Surveys with ALMA the Atacama Large
Millimetresubmillimetre Array will probably resolve this issue
Detecting gas-dominated nuclear bars requires surveys of gas morphology and kinematics
in the central few hundred parsec of disk galaxies at a resolution of 10 pc An additional
detection problem can arise from gaseous bars being very short-lived  an issue related to
the stability of these objects which we discuss below
An analysis of the nested bars in the Laine et al 2002 sample has claried some of
the basic properties of nested bar systems Firstly it has shown that the size distributions of
large-scale and nuclear bars dier profoundly and exhibit a bimodal behaviour Whether bar
sizes are taken as physical or normalised by the galaxy size r25 there is little overlap between
their distributions In physical units this division lies at r  16 kpc in normalised  around
rr25  012 This bimodality can be explained in terms of a disk resonance the ILR and the
above radii can be identied with the position of this resonance The ILR acts therefore as a
dynamical separator The ILRs are expected to form where the gravitational potential of the
inner galaxy switches from three-dimensional to two-dimensional This normally happens at
the bulge-disk interface or alternatively where the disk thickness becomes comparable to
its radial extension To summarise while the sizes of large-scale bars in nested bars as well
as those of single bars exhibit a linear correlation with disk size nuclear bars do not show
4One can envisage also the existence of gaseousstellar bars where the large-scale bar is gaseous and the
inner bar is stellar
 66 
the same behaviour
Secondly nuclear bars almost always come in conjunction with large-scale bars  a clear
signature that this is a prerequisite for their existence although one can envisage a scenario
where they form separately Thirdly the size distribution of nuclear rings in these galaxies
peaks at the same radii of rr25  012 see above which signals again at the crucial role
the ILR plays in the dynamics of these systems Finally nuclear bars in nested systems have
smaller ellipticities than their large-scale counterparts
The search for stellar nuclear bars is limited to optical and NIR surface photometry 
an insucient method based on the isophote tting which can be aected by the presence of
nuclear clusters starbursts and dust A suggestion to look for the characteristic oset dust
lanes delineating shocks in nuclear bars similar to those observed in large-scale bars did
not work The reason for this is a dierent gas-ow response in these systems see below
Nuclear bars are not scaled-down versions of large-scale bars
Probably the mostly intriguing aspect of nested bars is that their pattern speeds are
dierent at least during some particular stages of evolution as predicted Shlosman et al
1989 1990 supported by the detection of random mutual orientations of bars Friedli et al
1996 and conrmed in a direct measurement of their pattern speeds Corsini et al 2003
812 Theoretical perspective bars-in-bars mechanism
From a theoretical point of view nested bar systems provide a great laboratory to
study non-linear dynamics in physical systems How do such systems form Are they long-
or short-lived What is their role in driving the secular evolution of disk galaxies As in the
case of single bars numerical simulations of such systems are indispensable
The rst attempts to simulate pure stellar nested bar systems have succeeded in forming
both bars via the bar instability but the lifetime of such a system was short eg Friedli
 Martinet 1993 The problem with the lifetime has been purely numerical  when the
resolution of N-body simulations has been increased the system of two stellar bars has lived
indenitely long eg Pfenniger 2001 The issue of the initial conditions for such systems
however is much more fundamental It is quite revealing that in pure stellar systems one
can create nested bars only by assembling the stellar disk as bar-unstable on both large and
small spatial scales  naturally because of the shorter timescale of the inner bar it will
develop rst But why would Nature create such a strongly bar-unstable stellar disk No
process known to us can create such a disk by means of a dissipationless uid Therefore
strong arguments appear in favour of a dissipational process which naturally involves the gas
 67 
Shlosman 2005 and references therein The initial conditions necessary to create a nested
bar system become nearly a trivial matter when dissipation is involved
The role of stellar bars in angular momentum redistribution is most important when
the gaseous component is involved Bars are very ecient in extracting of the angular
momentum from the gas and during the bar instability also from the stars and depositing
it in the outer disk beyond the corotation radius The ability of the DM halo to absorb the
angular momentum has been noticed long ago eg Sellwood 1980 Debattista  Sellwood
1998 and quantied in terms of the lower resonances recently Athanassoula 2002 2003
Martnez-Valpuesta et al 2006
The outward ow of the angular momentum in barred galaxies is associated with the
inward ow of the gas Skipping the details this gas accumulates within the central kpc
where the gravitational torques from the large-scale bar are minimised eg Shlosman 2005
The star formation in the bar is largely dampened because of the substantial shear behind
the large-scale shocks So one should not be concerned with gas depletion before it crosses
the ILR Hence the action of the large bar leads to a radial inow  the rate of this inow
depends on a number of factors
In the cosmological setting which is the subject of this
review the outer bar will interact with and can in fact be triggered by the asymmetry eg
triaxiality of the DM halo Heller et al 2007a or by interaction with DM substructure
Romano-Daz et al 2008b
The accumulation of gas within the ILR can and probably does lead to a nuclear star-
burst in nuclear rings If however the gas inow rate across the ILR is high enough or the
star formation is dampened by a local turbulent eld the stellargaseous uid can trigger
the formation of a nuclear bar Shlosman et al 1989 when the gas becomes dynamically
important and triggers an additional responce from the stellar uid as conrmed by numer-
ical simulations Friedli  Martinet 1993 Englmaier  Shlosman 2004 In this respect the
large-scale bar is a primary and the nuclear bar is a secondary feature Fig 18a This is the
so-called bars-in-bars mechanism
From a dynamical point of view it is challenging to explain how two gravitational
quadrupoles tumble with dierent pattern speeds p primary and s secondary with-
out exerting a braking eect on each other Such a system can serve as an astrophysical
counterpart of a system of coupled oscillators which is a familiar tool to study non-linear
behaviour Essentially three dynamical states exist for such a system but only two of them
appear dynamically long-lived The rst state involves two bars with equal pattern speeds
 this is a stable state and the bars stay perpendicular to each other which is energetically
advantageous The second state is made out of two bars which tumble with dierent pattern
speeds but their ratio is xed sp  constant In a way the rst state is a special case

which tumble with dierent pattern speeds where their ratio is time-dependent and evolves
on a dynamical timescale  this is a transition state between two stable states with the xed
ratio of pattern speeds Naturally this state is a short-lived one We call the rst two states
coupled5 and the third one decoupled
5Note that various denitions of coupleddecoupled states exist in the literature and are rened occasion-
ally by the same authors including in our own work
 69 
The explanation for the coupled state is based on a non-linear mode coupling these
modes exchange energies and angular momentum and therefore support their pattern speeds
which otherwise would decay exponentially due to the gravitational torques When the bars
are locked in sp  constant a local minimum should exist in the eciency of energy
transfer between the bars A strong resonance which can capture the bar is necessary One
would expect the low resonances to play a major role in the locking process especially the
ILR eg Lichtenberg  Lieberman 1995 Tagger et al 1987 Shlosman 2005
Numerical simulations enable one to follow the decoupling process in nested bars En-
glmaier  Shlosman 2004 Figures 18cd provide an example of this process when a sec-
ondary bar which forms within the ILR of the primary bar and obeys sp  1 speeds
up in a short time until its corotation radius moves to the ILR position of the primary
bar and sp  36 The shape of the nuclear bar depends on their mutual orientation
Fig 18b and is dynamically important  the bar axial ratio is one of the measures of its
strength and therefore determines the fraction of chaotic orbits there which is a measure
of stochasticity within the bar and its possible demise Another example in the cosmological
setting describes the evolution of a nested bar system which is locked in two dierent coupled
states and transits between them Heller et al 2007a
Dierent methods have been developed to quantify nested bar systems especially to
measure the amount and the eect of multi-periodic and chaotic orbits As we are interested
in the secular evolution of these systems we only mention that the orbital structure asso-
ciated with long-lived nested bars has been investigated A counterpart of periodic orbits
in single bars is based on the fruitful concepts of a loop Maciejewski  Sparke 2000 and
on that of the Liapunov exponents El-Zant  Shlosman 2003 Orbit analysis based on
these two concepts has demonstrated that orbits are dominated by the potentials of single
bars with the possibility of migration from bar to bar across the interface between the bars
El-Zant  Shlosman 2003 Maciejewski  Athanassoula 2007
The gas dynamics at the bar-bar interface is determined by the already irregular gas
ow perturbed by the secondary bar with sp  1 For such bars the inow is chaotic
and dominated by shocks Strong dissipation in the gas will not allow it to settle on stable
orbits there Instead the gas will fall to smaller radii eg Shlosman  Heller 2002 The
immediate corollary is that one should not expect starbursts throughout secondary bars
except in the central regions Shocks and shear within the bar would slash molecular clouds
reducing the SFRs In particular the mode where star formation occurs in massive stellar
clusters should be absent in secondary bars except maybe in the central region although
even there it can be dampened if the gas can be maintained in a strongly turbulent state
The situation is very dierent for bars with sp  1 In this case one should observe
 70 
a relaxed ow and a grand-design shock system but no random shocks The dissipation
is decreased compared to other cases
813 Nested bars evolutionary corollaries
Bars are known to channel the gas to the central kpc Over a Hubble time bars are
capable of aecting the angular momentum prole in the stellar component as well This
process acts slowly but relentlessly in changing the mass distribution in galaxies Occasion-
ally during various instabilities bars are capable of increasing the central mass concentration
in galaxies on short dynamical timescales eg Dubinski et al 2009 Nested bars are the
result of this evolution when the amount of gas moved by the primary bar is able to change
the stellar dynamics inside the central kpc Generally when the gas has reached 10 of
the mass fraction in the central regions it can aect the stellar dynamics there When a
secondary bar forms the local conditions for star formation will be altered as well The
decrease in the SFR will eliminate the ISM sink and facilitate further radial infall of gas
Further surveys of gas kinematics in the central region should answer the question of whether
these ows fuel the AGN
The fuelling of AGN is of course one of the outstanding issues in galaxy evolution Are
they fuelled locally say by a neighbourhood stellar cluster or by the main body of the host
galaxy Diverging views prevail on this subject The duty cycle of AGN is not known at
present Does it depend on the class of AGN say QSOs versus Seyferts If the AGN are
fuelled by the bars-in-bars mechanism that characteristic timescale of the process can be as
short as 106 yr as gaseous bars are short-lived What fraction of the gas ends up in the
accretion disk around the SMBH
What is clear is that preferring local mechanisms eg star clusters in fuelling the AGN
does not solve the issue as it begs the question of what fuelled the formation of local stars
Rather one can argue that star formation in the vicinity of the SMBH is a by-product of
the overall gas inow to the galactic centre Such an inow will always be associated with
compression and star formation along the AGN fuelling process The following scenario can
actually lead to an anti-correlation of gaseous bars with AGN activity
if the gaseous bar
activates the AGN cycle and as a by-product the local star formation the AGN and stellar
feedback would disperse the gas in the next stage
What is the fate of gaseous bars The central feedback can drive the local azimuthal
mixing of the barred gas component if the energy is deposited in the turbulent motions
in the gas and ultimately contribute to the growth of the stellar bulge disky or classical
 71 
Strong winds driven by the nuclear starburst can be a by-product Alternatively these winds
can be driven via hydromagnetic winds as discussed earlier Such extensive outows from
the centres of AGN host galaxies have recently been detected
The study of nuclear bars especially gaseous ones will proceed quickly when ALMA
comes online We have omitted interesting options which can in fact be detected by up-
coming observations of these objects One of these is the occasional injection of the gaseous
component in the nuclear stellar bars How does this inuence the evolution of the system
and especially the gas inow toward the central SMBH
82 The origin of SMBHs the by-product of galaxy evolution
QSOs have been detected so far up to z  7 when the age of the Universe was substan-
tially less than 1 Gyr Even more intriguing is the inferred mass of their SMBHs  109 M
Within the framework of hierarchical buildup of mass these objects must originate in rare
highly over-dense regions of the Universe
Indeed recent studies of high-z QSOs have indicated that they reside in very rare over-
dense regions at z  6 with a comoving space density of 22 073h3 Gpc3 Numerical
simulations give a similar comoving density of massive DM haloes of a few1012 M The
caveat however is that this similarity depends on the QSO duty cycle  the fraction of time
the QSO is actually active Romano-Daz et al 2011a For a duty cycle which is less than
unity QSOs will appear less rare and reside in less massive haloes On the other hand these
QSOs are metal-rich and are therefore plausibly located at the centres of massive galaxies
The causal connection between AGN and their host galaxies is a long-debated issue
and substantial evidence has accumulated in favour of this relation SMBHs are ubiquitous
If the formation and growth of SMBHs is somehow correlated with their host galaxy growth
within the cosmological framework what are the possible constraints on the formation time
of these objects What are the possible seeds of SMBHs
821 SMBH seeds population III versus direct collapse
Population III Pop III stars can form BH seeds of M  102 M eg Bromm  Loeb
2003 An alternative to this is the so-called monolithic or direct collapse to a SMBH
Begelman et al 2006 A gas with a primordial composition which has a cooling oor
of Tgas  104 K can collapse into DM haloes with a virial temperature of Tvir  Tgas  104 K
This corresponds roughly to Mvir  108 M In a WMAP7 Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
 72 
Probe universe this can involve about 2 107 M baryons If the gas has been enriched
previously by Pop III stars the halo mass can be smaller and the amount of baryons involved
can be smaller as well
The Pop III SMBH seeds will be required to grow from 102 M to  109 M in less
than 6 108 yr ie from z  20 to z  7 The e-folding time for SMBH growth is Salpeter
te  
4Gmp cid18LE
L cid19  44  108cid18 LE
L cid19 yr
where LE is the Eddington luminosity and  01 is the accretion eciency The growth
time to the SMBH masses estimated for high-z QSOs is
tgrowth  31  109cid18LE
L cid19 yr
which is uncomfortably long and close to the age of the Universe
If the SMBH growth
is via mergers this requires frequent merger events When the merging rate is too high
SMBHs can be ejected via slingshots which should limit the eciency of this process If the
dominant mode is accretion it will be limited by  LE and maybe by the feedback which
again would limit the eciency or even cut o the accretion process
Alternatively monolithic direct collapse will require a growth from 1067 M to
109 M from z  1220 to z  67 This will involve fewer mergers but growth by accretion
may lead to fragmentation of the accretion ows star formation and depletion of the gas
supply for the seed SMBH
The collapse rates can be estimated from M  v3G Shlosman  Begelman 1989
where v is the characteristic infall velocity which results in mass accretion rates of 104 to
105 M yr1 for a stellar collapse with virial temperatures 1012 K 102 to 104 M yr1
for a Pop III collapse with 1023 K and  101 M yr1 for a direct collapse to the seed
SMBH with  104 K
However a spherical collapse over decades in r is improbable  the angular momentum
barrier will stop it suciently quickly Numerical simulations of a baryon collapse into
108 M DM haloes have shown explicitly that the angular momentum plays an important
role eg Wise et al 2008 as expected of course The baryon collapse in the presence of a
typical halo angular momentum  005 will develop virial turbulent velocities driven by
the gravitational potential energy The turbulence is supersonic The collapse can proceed
until the angular momentum barrier stops it If the system reaches equilibrium the turbulent
velocities will decay and the disk will fragment forming stars However the ability of the
ow to fragment depends on its equation of state and should not be taken for granted eg
 73 
Paczynski 1978 Shlosman et al 1990 Begelman  Shlosman 2009 nd that such a decay
in the turbulent support will trigger a bar instability in the gaseous disk before it fragments
In other words the global instability sets in before the local instability develops The bar
instability will create intrinsic shocks in the gas and the collapse will resume  again pumping
energy into turbulent motions This is the same bars-in-bars runaway scenario as discussed
in the previous section
The turbulent support is especially helpful in suppressing fragmentation in 108 M DM
haloes when the baryons are metal-rich Previously it was suggested that the fragmentation
in metal-rich ows in such haloes would suppress the formation of a SMBH and lead to star
formation instead
Supersonic turbulence requires continuous driving A reliable diagnostic of this ow
is the density PDF discussed in Section 6 The log-normal PDF depends on the density
uctuations around some average 0 or x 0 when normalised Fig 19 The supersonic
turbulence developing during the overall collapse will generate gas clumps Two spatial
scales characterise this turbulence  the Jeans scale and the so-called transition scale below
which the ow becomes supersonic ie in essence the clump size
A fraction of these clumps will be Jeans-unstable However only the fraction of these
clumps that contract on a timescale shorter than the free-fall time for the overall col-
lapse can actually contribute to the star formation These active clumps should have
x  xcrit  vturbvK2M2 where vturb is the typical turbulent velocity vK is the Keplerian
velocity and M is the Mach number of the supersonic ow Other clumps even when
Jeans-unstable will be swept away by the next crossing shock To estimate the fraction of
star-forming clumps one should integrate the PDF from xcrit to  For M  3 this fraction
is  001 Hence in a ow with a mildly supersonic turbulence the SFR is heavily dampened
822 Direct collapse two alternatives
Present numerical simulations of the direct collapse to the SMBH cannot answer the ul-
timate question about how and when the SMBH will form At small spatial scales new phys-
ical processes should become important such as radiative transfer as the matter becomes
10es cm where 10  10 km s1
opaque This can be estimated to happen at 10133
and es is the electron scattering opacity At what stage will the bars-in-bars cycle be broken
What are the intermediate congurations that lead to the SMBH
The fate of the direct collapse has been analysed by Begelman et al 2006 under the
assumption that the angular momentum is unimportant Under these conditions there is no

Fig 19 Simulation of direct collapse to the SMBH from Choi et al 2012 Left the projected
gas density along the rotation axis at an intermediate time of t 46 Myr shows the central disk-like
conguration The frame captures the central runaway collapse forming one of the gaseous bars on
a scale of 1 pc The collapse proceeds from the initial scale of 3 kpc  the DM halo virial radius

developed turbulence eld in the collapsing gas
preferential channel for energy release The photon trapping in the collapsing matter results
in the formation of a single accreting massive object in a pressure equilibrium termed a
quasistar The follow-up evolution leads to thermonuclear reactions within the object for
106 yr At some point neutrino cooling becomes important which denes the quasistar
core 10 M Neutrino-cooled core collapse will determine the seed SMBH mass The
subsequent rapid super-Eddington growth of the seed will result in M  1046 M
What is the possible alternative to this scenario Choi et al 2012 have assumed that
the angular momentum dominates at some spatial scale of the inow and it does indeed dene
the preferential channel for energy release Under these conditions photon trapping may
not be important and an optically-thick disktorus will form instead of a quasistar This
is a way to bypass the thermonuclear reaction stage as well but at the price of additional
dynamical instabilities The SMBH seed which forms will be more massive than in the
previous case M  1067 M

9 Summary and future prospects
The cosmological evolution of galaxies is a fascinating subject which has experienced
explosive growth lately due to the incredible rate of new observational data and the de-
velopment of new methods and codes in this observationally and computationally intensive
research eld In this review we have discussed various aspects of galaxy evolution The
original paradigm of this evolution is being replaced slowly but persistently by a modied
view  a process which is driven by a long list of recent discoveries
Probably nowhere is this more obvious than in our understanding of the main factors
behind galaxy growth The cold accretion scenario has successfully challenged the merger-
only picture The new approach raised a number of challenging questions How important is
the accretion shock What fraction of the gas is actually processed by the shock How does
the accretion ow join the growing disk Via shocks or smoothly assembling in the outer
disk These outstanding questions will be answered shortly via high-resolution numerical
simulations On the other hand observations must answer questions about the redshift
evolution of cold accretion ows Furthermore the issue of the actual detection of ows in
cosmological laments is an open one and will help to resolve at least partly the problem of
the missing baryons And of course the increasing number of detected galaxies at redshifts
corresponding to the re-ionisation epoch must answer the fundamental questions about the
morphological types of the rst galaxies their mode of growth and the other scaling relations
established at low redshifts eg the morphology-density relation
The subject of stellar and AGN feedback on galaxy evolution is truly a Pandoras
box The inclusion of feedback has clearly solved the overcooling problem However the
current subgrid physics used to quantify SN feedback and feedback from OB stellar winds
AGN and galactic winds has too many parameters to be ne-tuned For AGN feedback
mechanisms more sophisticated than considering the AGN as a giant O star are needed
Does it quench the star formation and clean the galaxies of their ISM or is this feedback
much more anisotropic producing much less disturbance for the rest of the host galaxy At
high redshifts z  610 does the QSO feedback induce or dampen galaxy formation
How do galactic winds form They are clearly detected in observations but the un-
derlying theory requires much more work In fact almost any model of the wind from any
astrophysical object experiences diculties in describing the physics of wind initiation
There are too many bulgeless disks in the Universe This comes as a surprise and as
another challenge One approach attempted successfully has related this phenomenon to the
feedback problem Indeed back-of-the-envelope estimates show convincingly that the SNe
can expel the ISM and therefore eliminate the bulge buildup in smaller galaxies Additional
 76 
work is required to understand the eciency of this process Could it be too ecient
Massive disks provide another challenge In a number of cases cold gas has been detected in
the central regions but no indication of intensive star formation at least not in the mode
of massive clusters How can one suppress the star formation while leaving the gas intact
One possibility lies in pumping the energy into turbulent motions in the gas Observations
will resolve this issue soon
Where do stars form This simple question has an interesting twist Do stars form as
a result of Jeans instability in the molecular gas Or does the molecular gas itself form as a
result of the Jeans instability in the neutral gas This issue has immediate consequences for
numerical simulations of galaxy evolution Because we still cannot resolve the star-forming
regions what should be used as a density threshold for star formation
The growing list of high-redshift galaxies presently extending to z  104 and proto-
clusters extending to z  8 will soon increase dramatically We have already mentioned
the importance of measuring the scaling relations at these redshifts but even more basic
parameters like the galaxy LF or the rate of star formation must be measured as well Is
the evolution of the specic SFR so at even at redshifts beyond 7
Dierent challenges are expected to resolve the kinematics of cold gas in galactic centres
A high-resolution survey of gas morphology will probably be produced by ALMA What
fraction of this gas is in a relaxed orbital motion and what fraction is in a barred state
What is the relation between the AGN host galaxy and the central SMBH We know that
Seyfert activity is probably not triggered by galaxy interactions or mergers We also know
that the brightest of AGN the QSOs can be fuelled by this process Overall a number
of factors can fuel the accretion onto the SMBH but it would be interesting to understand
the statistics of local versus non-local sources of fuelling If both are involved where is the
boundary between them
The bulge buildup is partly a dissipative process but it appears now that stellar-
dynamical instabilities play an important role as well The relation between the origin
of peanutboxy bulges and vertical buckling in stellar bars has been now established But
this instability is recurrent and what determines the timescale of the onset of the next stage
in this instability is not yet clear
The fate of nuclear bars is really lost in the darkness While purely stellar nested bars
can live indenitely the gas can still make a dierence especially in gas-rich nuclear bars
What is their relation to the bulge build-up And to AGN fuelling
Finally an outstanding issue is when and where the SMBHs form and how massive
their seeds are Are they formed at very high redshifts from Pop III remnants or at lower
 77 
redshifts in a direct collapse inside DM minihaloes of 108 M The separate problems in
galaxy evolution we have discussed above join together to complicate this process Does the
accretion ow fragment or does the induced turbulence dampen the Jeans instability and
does the seed SMBH form more massive Is the angular momentum problem resolved in this
case by the bars-in-bars mechanism Observers can hope to detect the quasistars  the last
stage before the horizon is formed Or does the energy escape along the preferred channel
without interacting and stopping the inow In this case the evolution may bypass the
quasistar stage The detection of intermediate-mass black holes can help here
I would like to complete these lecture notes with my favourite question asked by Stanis-
law Lem in his novel Ananke Where is that order and whence came this mocking illusion
