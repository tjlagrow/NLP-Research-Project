Abstract Measurements of the kinematics of merging galaxies are of-
ten used to derive dynamical masses study evolution onto the fundamen-
tal plane or probe relaxation processes These measurements are often
compromised to some degree by strong non-equilibrium motions in the
merging galaxies This talk focuses on the evolution of the kinematics of
merging galaxies and highlights some pitfalls which occur when studying
non-equilibrium systems
1 Evolution of Velocity Moments in Merging Galaxies
The global kinematics of merging galaxies are often used to infer dynamical
masses or study evolution of merger remnants onto the fundamental plane eg
Lake  Dressler 1986 Shier et al 1994 James et al 1999 In systems well out
of equilibrium these measurements may not yield true estimates of the velocity
dispersion of the system For example in a merger where the nuclei have not yet
coalesced much of the kinetic energy of the the system may be in bulk motion
of the nuclei rather than in pure random stellar motions Such conditions could
in principle lead to systematic errors in dynamical masses or fundamental plane
properties Equally important is the timescale over which any merger-induced
kinematic irregularities are mixed away through violent relaxation or mixing
To examine the evolution of the kinematic moments of a galaxy merger
Figure 1 shows the projected velocity moments in an N-body model of an equal
mass galaxy merger The data is constructed to simulate observations with
modest spatial resolution of  1 kpc The low order moments of the velocity
distribution very quickly evolve to their nal value  violent relaxation in the
inner regions is extremely ecient Even during the nal coalescence phase the
velocity dispersion of the merger is essentially unchanging except for extreme
situations where the remnant is viewed almost exactly along the orbital plane
This analysis suggests that studies which place mergers on the fundamental
plane are not excessively compromised by possible kinematic evolution of the
remnants instead luminosity evolution should dominate any changes in the
properties of the remnant
At larger radius the merger remnant possesses a signicant rotational com-
ponent as transfer of orbital angular momentum has spun up the remnant eg
Hernquist 1992 The higher order velocity moments skew and kurtosis con-
tinue to evolve for several dynamical times particularly in the outer portions of
the remnant where the mixing timescale is long These higher order moments
also vary signicantly with viewing angle reecting the fact that the merger

containing 10 50 and 80 of the total stellar mass of the system
error bars show the variance of the measured moments due to viewing
geometry v is the velocity dierence between the opposite sides of
the galaxies The nuclei are separated by  5 kpc at T60 and coalesce
at T70 To scale to Milky Way-type progenitors unit time is 13 Myr
and unit velocity is 250 kms
kinematics maintain a memory of the initial orbital angular momentum As
high angular momentum material streams back into the remnant from the tidal
debris incomplete mixing results in extremely non-gaussian line proles
2 Local Stellar Kinematics and Ghost Masses
On smaller scales however measurements of local velocity dispersion can give
erroneous results if the system has not yet relaxed Figure 2 shows the merger
model observed at higher spatial resolution at a time when the nuclei are still
separated by a few kpc Looking along the orbital plane the nuclei still possess
a signicant amount of bulk motion Measured on small scales this bulk motion
shows as a gradient in the projected radial velocity across the two nuclei Perhaps
more interesting is the rise in projected velocity dispersion between the nuclei
where the the velocity prole shows a single broad line with dispersion  30
higher than in the nuclei themselves A similar rise is seen between the nuclei
of NGC 6240 Tezca et al 1999 in prep referenced in Tacconi et al 1999
where a central gas concentration exists The simulations here indicate that
such features can arise in double nucleus systems even when no central mass
exists and suggest that dynamical masses inferred this way can be signicantly
overestimated
In this case the full analysis of the line proles results in a better under-
standing of the dynamical conditions The gradient across the nuclei again is
an indicator of large bulk motions and the shape of the line prole is rather
at-topped negative kurtosis exactly what is expected from the incomplete
blending of two separate line proles Here of course the increase in velocity

dispersion is due simply to the projected overlap of the nuclei but the complete
line prole is needed to unravel the complex dynamics
Ionized Gas Kinematics and Starburst Winds
Finally while gas kinematics are perhaps the easiest to measure they give the
most ambiguous measurement of the gravitational kinematics of a merging sys-
tem Aside from the problems of the evolving gravitational kinematics and
line-of-sight projection eects gas kinematics are also subject to inuences such
as shocks radial inow and starburst winds All of these conspire to make a
very confusing kinematic dataset
A case in point is the ultraluminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240 This star-
burst system has a double nucleus separated by  15 and is clearly a late
stage merger Based on H velocity mapping of this system Bland-Hawthorn
et al 1991 proposed that a 1012M black hole exists well outside the nucleus
at a projected distance of 6 kpc The major piece of evidence supporting this
claim was a sharp gradient in the ionized gas kinematics suggestive of a rapidly
rotating disk
To study this object in more detail we van der Marel et al in prep have
initiated a program using HST to obtain imaging and longslit spectroscopic
data for the inner regions of NGC 6240 Figure 3 shows an F814W image of
the center of NGC 6240 along with a narrow band image centered on HNII
taken using the F673N lter which for NGC 6240 fortuitously sits on redshifted
H The narrow band image shows a clear starburst wind morphology in the
ionized gas

Narrow band H image The position of the reported 1012M black
hole Bland-Hawthorn et al 1991 is shown along with the position
angle of the purported disk surrounding it
Overplotted on Figure 3b is the position of the putative black hole along
with the position angle of the observed velocity gradient Interestingly the po-
sition lies directly along an ionized lament from the starburst wind with the
kinematic gradient directed orthogonal to the laments direction While our
narrow-band data do not go deep enough to study the detailed distribution of
ionized gas immediately surrounding the proposed black hole the image cer-
tainly suggests that the observed kinematics may be strongly inuenced by the
starburst wind indicating that the black hole may not be real The strong gradi-
ent that was attributed to a black hole may instead be due to kinematic gradients
in the starburst wind or even simple geometry of the wind lament projecting
on top of background system emission We have follow-up STIS spectroscopy
planned to further study the complex kinematics in this intriguing system
