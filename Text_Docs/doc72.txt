Living cells deploy many resources to sense their environments including receptors downstream
signaling molecules time and fuel However it is not known which resources fundamentally limit
the precision of sensing like weak links in a chain and which can compensate each other leading to
trade-os between them We show by modeling that in equilibrium systems the precision is limited
by the number of receptors the downstream network can never increase precision This limit arises
from a trade-o between the removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor and intrinsic noise in the
downstream network Non-equilibrium systems can lift this trade-o by storing the receptor state
over time in chemical modication states of downstream molecules As we quantify for a push-pull
network this requires i time and receptors ii downstream molecules iii energy fuel turnover to
drive modication These three resource classes cannot compensate each other and it is the limiting
class which sets the fundamental sensing limit Within each class trade-os are possible Energy
allows a power-speed trade-o while time can be traded against receptors

Biochemical networks are the information processing
devices of life Like any device they require resources to
be built and run Components are needed to construct
the network space is required to accommodate the com-
ponents time is needed to process the information and
energy is required to make the components and operate
the network These resources constrain the design and
performance of any biochemical network Yet it is not
clear which resources are indispensable thus fundamen-
tally limiting the performance of the network and which
resources might trade-o against each other Here we
consider the interplay among cellular resources network
design and performance in a canonical biochemical func-
tion namely sensing the environment
Living cells can measure chemical concentrations with
extraordinary precision 13 raising the question what
sets the fundamental limit to the accuracy of chemical
sensing 1 Cells measure chemical concentrations via
receptors on their surface These measurements are in-
evitably corrupted by noise that arises from the stochas-
tic arrival of ligand molecules by diusion and from the
stochastic binding of the ligand to the receptor Berg and
Purcell pointed out that the sensing error is fundamen-
tally bounded by this noise extrinsic to the cell but that
cells can reduce the error by taking multiple indepen-
dent measurements mitigating the risk that any one is
corrupted by a noisy uctuation 1 One way to increase
the number of measurements is to add more receptors to
the surface 1 4 Another is to take more measurements
per receptor over time in this approach the cell infers
the concentration not from the instantaneous number of
ligand-bound receptors but rather from the time-average
receptor occupancy over an integration time T 1 410
This time integration has to be performed by the sig-
naling networks that transmit the information from the
surface of the cell to its interior 10 To reach the funda-
mental limit on the accuracy of sensing these networks
have to remove the extrinsic noise in the receptor state as
much as possible Signaling networks however are also
stochastic in nature which means that they will also add
noise to the transmitted signal Most studies on the ac-
curacy of sensing have ignored this intrinsic noise of the
signaling network They essentially assume that the in-
trinsic noise can be made arbitrarily small and that the
extrinsic noise in the input signal can be ltered with ar-
bitrary precision by simply integrating the receptor sig-
nal for longer Yet the extrinsic and intrinsic noise are
not generally independent 11 Indeed what resources
are required to simultaneously remove the extrinsic and
intrinsic noise is not understood
While the work of Berg and Purcell and subsequent
studies identify time and the number of receptors as re-
sources that limit the accuracy of sensing the fundamen-
tal limits that have emerged ignore the cost of making
and operating the signaling network Making proteins is
costly producing proteins that confer no benet to the
cell has been shown to slow down bacterial growth 12
They also take up valuable space that might be used
for other important processes either on the membrane
or inside the cytoplasm Both are highly crowded with
proteins occupying 25  75 of the membrane area 13
and 20 30 of the cytoplasmic volume 14 Moreover
many signaling networks must be driven out of thermo-
dynamic equilibrium by the continuous turnover of fuel
molecules such as ATP leading to the dissipation of heat
Fuel is essential for network functions such as bistability
oscillations and kinetic proofreading 1517 and can
be important for adaptation 18 19 However whether
there exists a fundamental relationship between energy
and sensing independent of the design of the signaling
network inside the cell remains unclear 2022
In this manuscript we derive how the accuracy of sens-
ing depends on not only time and the number of recep-
tors but also on the resources required to build and op-
erate the downstream signaling network the copies of
signaling molecules and fuel This allows us to address
the following questions How do the sensing limits set
by the latter resources compare to the canonical limit
of Berg and Purcell which is set by the resources time
and the number of receptors How does the limit set by
one resource depend on the levels of the other resources
Can resources compensate each other to achieve a desired
sensing precision leading to trade-os between them or
are the limits set by the respective resources fundamen-
tal ie independent of the levels of the other resources
And how do the limits depend on the design of the sig-
naling network The relationship between the accuracy
of sensing the design of the network and the resources
required to build and operate ittime energy and pro-
tein copiesunderlies the design principles of biochemi-
cal sensing systems
We rst study the relationship between sensing preci-
sion network design and resources for systems that are
not driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium consum-
ing no fuel We nd that these equilibrium networks can
time-integrate the receptor signal to remove the extrin-
sic noise in it analogous to the mechanism described by
Berg and Purcell Clearly fuel is not a fundamental re-
source for sensing or removing extrinsic noise However
using the uctuation-dissipation theorem we will show
that equilibrium networks face a fundamental trade-o
between the removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor
state and the suppression of intrinsic noise in the pro-
cessing network decreasing one source of noise necessar-
ily increases the other As a result the accuracy of sens-
ing is fundamentally limited by the number of receptors
in equilibrium networks adding downstream components
can never improve the sensing precision
To improve the sensing accuracy beyond the limit
set by the number of receptors it is essential to break
the trade-o between extrinsic and intrinsic noise As
we show this requires a fundamentally dierent sensing
mechanism Instead of using the receptors to harvest the
energy of ligand binding as in the equilibrium sensing
mode the receptors should be used as catalysts to modify
downstream read-out molecules This non-equilibrium
strategy however uses not only receptors but requires
also time copies of downstream read-out molecules and
fuel turnover
We quantify the limits that arise from each of
the resourcescopies of
receptors and downstream
molecules time and fuelfor a canonical signaling mo-
tif a receptor that drives a Goldbeter-Koshland push-
pull network 23 Push-pull networks are ubiquitous in
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell signaling 24 examples
include GTPase cycles as in the Ras system 25 and
phosphorylation cycles as in mitogen-activated-protein-
kinase MAPK cascades 26 or in two-component sys-
tems like the chemotaxis system of Escherichia coli 27
We nd that the resource limitations of these systems
emerge naturally when the signaling networks are viewed
as devices that discretely rather than continuously sam-
ple the receptor state via collisions of the signaling
molecules with the receptor proteins This analysis re-
veals that three classes of resources are required i time
and receptors ii copies of downstream molecules and
iii fuel Indeed these classes cannot compensate each
other each imposes a sensing limit and it is the limiting
class that imposes the fundamental limit on the accuracy
of sensing However there can be trade-os within each
class of resources Receptors and time trade o against
each other in achieving a desired sensing accuracy and
power and response time trade o against each other to
meet the energy requirement for taking a measurement
We end by discussing how our ndings apply to specic
signaling systems and how our results on push-pull net-
works generalize to more complex networks involving cas-
cades and positive and negative feedback In particular
our analysis leads to a concrete prediction for the op-
timal resource allocation which we test for the E coli
chemotaxis system

TRADE-OFFS IN EQUILIBRIUM SENSING
Cells can reduce the error in Eq 2 with downstream
networks that time-integrate over the history of recep-
tor states 1 Key to the ability of networks to time-
integrate is a memory of these past states implemented
for example by a long-lived molecular species or a sig-
naling cascade that delays the signal 10 Equilibrium
systems can have these and hence have memory of the
past receptor states Thus we might expect that equi-
librium networks can reduce the sensing error past the
bound set by the number of receptors at the expense of
downstream signaling molecules
We consider cytoplasmic read-out molecules x that
bind ligand-free receptors R  L cid10 RL R  x
Solving the associated Langevin equations Materials and
Methods shows that the dynamics of the output around
its mean x is given by the time-integrated uctuations

This suggests that equilibrium networks can completely
lter the extrinsic noise in the receptor states and reduce
the sensing error to zero However the idea that the
sensing error can be reduced to zero ignores the fact that
in these equilibrium systems ligand-receptor binding and
receptor-read-out binding are coupled
In this specic
system these reactions are coupled because the read-out
and the ligand compete for binding to the receptor

Combining 2

ror for this network Eq 1 Analytically minimizing the
result we nd that it is never lower than the bound set
by the number of receptors ie NI  RT in Eq 2
regardless of the integration time or other parameters of
the network SI Text This raises the paradox of a net-
work that time-integrates the receptor uctuations yet
cannot reduce the sensing error with it The resolution
of the paradox is that in equilibrium systems the intrin-
sic and extrinsic noise are not independent precisely be-
cause receptor-ligand and receptor-readout binding are
coupled As a result the uctuations in the receptor
state and the read-out become correlated CRLt1 t2
is not zero 11 Because of these correlations equilib-
rium networks face a fundamental trade-o between the
removal of extrinsic noise in the receptor state and the
suppression of intrinsic in the downstream signaling net-
work In an optimally designed network that minimizes
the sensor error increasing the integration time reduces
the extrinsic noise but also increases the intrinsic noise
by at least the same amount
Signaling networks are usually far more complicated
than a single read-out molecule that binds the recep-
tor and it has been shown that additional network lay-
ers can reduce the sensing error 10 This raises the
question whether a more complicated equilibrium net-
work can overcome the limit set by the number of re-
ceptors Searching over all possible network topologies
to systematically address this question is dicult if not
impossible However equilibrium systems are fundamen-
tally bounded by the laws of equilibrium thermodynam-
ics regardless of their topology One such law is the
uctuation-dissipation theorem Just as a decrease in the
viscosity of a uid increases both the noise in a particles
Brownian motion and the sensitivity of its response to
an applied force so too do modications in equilibrium
networks aect both the noise in the read-out and the
sensitivity of its response to changes in the ligand con-
centration ie the gain
is equal to the covariance 2
Specically for any read-out x in an equilibrium sys-
tem the uctuation-dissipation theorem implies that the

The dierent species in a network can also be viewed as

FIG 1 The relationship among network design resources
and the precision of biochemical sensing Cells can use two
distinct modes of sensing and signaling the equilibrium mode
based on protein binding and sequestration and the non-
equilibrium mode based on protein modication driven by
fuel turnover Upper box In equilibrium sensing the sensing
accuracy is fundamentally limited by the number of receptors
regardless of the design of the downstream newtork Lower
box In non-equilibrium sensing the sensing precision is fun-
damentally limited by time and receptor copies energy and
copies of downstream readouts These three classes of re-
sources cannot compensate each other and it is the limiting
resource that sets the fundamental limit to the precision of
sensing Within each class however trade-os are possible
Power can be traded against speed to meet the energy re-
quirement for reaching a desired sensing accuracy while time
can be traded against the number of receptors
state but our results show that an equilibrium signaling
network cannot exploit this its output contains only as
much information as the instantaneous receptor state it
does not encode the history of receptor states in any in-
formative way whether by time-integration or any other
method
Ultimately equilibrium systems sense by harvesting
the energy of ligand binding This energy is used to
propagate the signal through the downstream network in
the simple system studied here for example the energy
of ligand binding is used to expel the read-out molecule
from the receptor However detailed balance then dic-
tates that the receptor-read-out binding also inuences
receptor-ligand binding thus perturbing the signal In-
deed the trade-os faced by equilibrium networks are all
dierent manifestations of their time-reversibility 30
The only way for a time-reversible system to integrate
the past is for it to integrateperturbthe future Con-
comitantly in a time reversible system there is no sense
of upstream and downstream concepts which rely
on a direction of time Although we have referred to the
molecule x as a readout of the ligand concentration
the ligand is just as much a readout of x While in equi-
librium systems the read-out encodes the receptor state
the read-out is not a stable memory that is decoupled
from changes in the receptor state It merely passively
In an equilibrium system the sensing error like
any static quantity can only depend on ratios of time
scales which is another way of seeing that increasing the
integration time cannot improve sensing
These results show that in an equilibrium system each
receptor provides at most one independent measurement
of the ligand regardless of how much information is en-
coded in the history of the receptor state how compli-
cated the signaling machinery is downstream how many
molecules are devoted to signaling downstream or how
long the apparent integration time of the network is En-
ergy dissipationfuel turnoveris required to break the
trade-os between noise and sensitivity between intrin-
sic and extrinsic noise and ultimately between the ac-
curacy of sensing and space on the membrane
NON-EQUILIBRIUM SENSING AT THE
MOLECULAR LEVEL
Networks that can reduce error via time-integration
must be non-equilibrium systems To understand the
resources required to reduce the sensing error in these
systems we need to understand how they sense at the
molecular level Berg and Purcell pointed out that by
integrating the receptor signal over a time T  the cell
can take as many as T 2c independent samples of the
receptor state 1 where c is the receptor correlation
time We will show that the cost of sensing depends on
how many of these samples the cell actually takes We

samples are not independent By building up the model
step by step we seek to understand how dierent fea-
tures of the network aect the number of samples their
independence and their accuracy One feature is that
molecules can be deactivated Fig 2C which we will
show is equivalent to discarding or erasing samples Ad-
ditionally reactions are microscopically reversible Fig
2D which means that read-out modications can oc-
cur independently of the receptor and receptor-mediated
modications can occur in the wrong direction both ef-
fects reduce the reliability of a sample Energy is needed
to break time-reversibility and to protect the coding We
arrive at an expression for the sensing error that com-
bines these eects It reveals trade-os between cellular
resources and performance speed accuracy energy and
the number of receptor and downstream molecules
Base model
For intuition we rst consider a cell that responds af-
ter a time T to a change in a ligands concentration at
some time t  0 based on the output x of the simple re-
action network x  RL kf x  RL Fig 2A We assume
that the cell starts with a large pool of inactive read-out
molecules x and that activated molecules x are never de-
activated For descriptive ease we assume the reaction is
diusion-limited so that each collision between an inac-
tive molecule x and a ligand-bound receptor leads to ac-
tivation of x The resulting sensing error can be derived
via Eq 1 from the Master Equation which describes
uctuations in the network see Materials and Methods
However to understand the required resources we cal-
culate the error instead by viewing the molecular network
as one that discretely samples the receptor state At the
molecular level readout molecules collide with the recep-
tor over time and are modied depending on the ligand-
occupation state of the receptor The total rate at which
inactive molecules collide with receptor molecules in any
state is r  kf xRT  kf XT RT for a large readout pool
and the total number of such collisions after time T is N 
with N  rT on average If a receptor molecule is bound
to ligand at the time of a collision the read-out molecule
is converted to its active form while if it is not the read-
out remains unchanged
In this way the state of the
receptor at the time of a collision is encoded in the state
of the read-out molecule that collided with it and the his-
tory of the receptor states is encoded in the states of the
read-out molecules at the time T Fig 2B The read-out
molecules that collided with the receptor thus constitute
samples of the receptor state The average number of
samples after time T is N  rT  kf XT RT T the prod-
uct of the total number of receptors RT and the number
of samples per receptor kf XT T during the integration
time T 
The sensing error can then be derived by viewing the
Sensing at the molecular level
FIG 2
A The ligand-
bound receptor drives the modication of a downstream read-
out ie the push-pull network RL  x  RL  x B The
biochemical network in A discretely samples the receptor
state illustrated for one receptor The states of the recep-
tor over time are encoded in the states of the N molecules
that collided with it the readout is modied if the receptor is
bound otherwise it is unmodied Molecules that collide with
the unbound receptor are indistinguishable from those that
have never collided leading to an additional error C Active
molecules can be degraded Some samples are erased and the
remaining samples are on average further apart more inde-
pendent D All reactions are in principle reversible com-
promising the encoding of the receptor state into the readout
The sensing error is determined by parameters that describe
the energy ow in the network including the ux n and the
free-energy drops 1 and 2 across the activation and de-
activation reactions of the readout respectively
therefore view the downstream network which consists of
discrete components as a system that discretely samples
the receptor state rather than integrating it
To gain intuition about the resources required to build
and operate these networks we construct step by step
a model of a receptor that drives a push-pull network
which is a canonical non-equilibrium motif in prokary-
otic and eukaryotic cell signaling 24
In these sys-
tems the receptor itself or the enzyme associated with
it such as CheA in bacterial chemotaxis 24 catalyzes
the chemical modication of a read-out protein The
general principle is that these networks take samples of
the receptor by storing its state in the stable modication
states of the read-out molecules Fig 2A B Each read-
out molecule that interacted with the receptor provides
a memory of the ligand-occupation state of that recep-
tor molecule collectively the read-out molecules encode
the history of the receptor states Quantitatively if there
are N receptor-readout interactions then the cell has N
samples of the receptor state and the error cc is re-
duced by a factor of N  as in Eq 2 or less if the

The second term in Eq 6 accounts for the fact that the
cell cannot distinguish between those molecules x that
have collided with an unbound receptor and hence pro-
vide information on the receptor occupancy and those
that have not collided with the receptor at all Fig 2B
If the cell could distinguish between those molecules
it could estimate the average receptor occupancy from
p  xN rather than p  x N  then the second term
would be zero SI Text Indeed the second term arises
from the biochemical noise that makes the actual num-
ber of samples N  dierent from its average N  How-
ever when p is small andor N is large the second term
is small compared to the rst and the sensing error is
given by the error of a single measurement 1p1  p

ing that the cell can sense perfectly if it waits long enough

ever modication states of molecules decay and their
nite lifetime cid96 limits sensing regardless of how long

imagine the deactivation is mediated by a phosphatase

We calculate the sensing error by solving the master
equation or by viewing the system as one that discretely
samples the receptor state as before SI Text We nd
that also with deactivation the sensing error is given by
Eqs 6 and 7 yet with fewer samples N  rcid96  rT

tion however only those readout molecules which have
collided with the receptor more recently than with the
phosphatase reect the receptor state At any given time
the average number of such readout molecules and hence
samples is N  rcid96 the lifetime cid96 thus sets an eective

of samples that are independent is determined by the ef-
fective spacing  between them see Eq 7 Though the
time between the creation of samples is still 1kf XT 
ie the spacing without readout deactivation some of
the samples are erased via collision with the phosphatase
We therefore expect that the spacing between remain-
ing samples is larger
Indeed calculating the eective
spacing between samples taking this eect into account
yields   2kf XT  which is twice that without de-
cay SI Text The fact that the remaining samples are
more independent explains a previously noted correspon-
dence 7 20 between the sensing error in a system with

Finite pool of read-out molecules
The copy numbers of signaling molecules are often
small To take this into account we compute the sensing
error from Eq 1 for a nite number of read-out molecules
XT using the linear-noise approximation to the Master
Equation describing the biochemical uctuations Mate-
rials and Methods and compare the result with Eq 6

network r  1kf pRT  kr
In essence cells count
only those samples created less than a relaxation time in
the past nothing that happened earlier can inuence the
current state including its ability to sense The fraction
of samples that is independent is given by Eq 7 with
  2r N RT   2kf x analogously to the previous
section
Reversibility
All reactions are in principle microscopically reversible
Taking this into account we recognize that active
molecules that collide with the bound receptor sometimes
molecules that collide with the phosphatase are some-
become inactive x  RL  x  RL and that inactive
times activated x  x Fig 2D These reverse reac-
tions compromise the encoding of the receptor state into
the read-out an active x molecule no longer encodes
the ligand-bound state of the receptor at a previous time
with 100 delity since it can also result from a collision
with the phosphatase similarly x rather than x may
reect a collision with the ligand-bound receptor
We compute the sensing error for the reversible net-
work from Eq 1 using the linear-noise approximation
to the master equation see Materials and Methods As
before it can be written as Eqs 6 and 7 The eec-
tive number of independent samples NI is a complicated
expression of the 8 fundamental variables in the system
the 6 rate constants describing the forward and reverse
rates of the 3 reactions including ligand-receptor bind-
ing and the total copy numbers XT and RT  How-
ever the expression has a particularly simple and illu-
minating form in terms of variables that describe as
we will show the resource limitations of the cell
addition to variables already dened p c RT  and
r these include the ux n of x across the cycle in
which it is created by the receptor and deactivated via
the phosphatase and the average free-energy drops 1
and 2 across the receptor-catalyzed pathway and the
phosphatase-catalyzed pathway respectively in units of
kBT Fig 2D Each of these variables depends in a com-
plicated way on the fundamental parameters of the sys-
tem the rate constants and the copy numbers In partic-
ular the free-energy drops are related to the propensities
i and i of the reactions in the forward and backward
directions respectively i  log i

Eq 8 is our principle result for non-equilibrium sys-
tems It takes into account readout deactivation the -
nite number of readout molecules and the reversibility of
reactions The equation has a clear interpretation The
product nr is the number of cycles of read-out molecules
involving collisions with ligand-bound receptor molecules

nrp is the total number of read-out cycles involving col-
lisions with receptor molecules be they ligand bound or
not it is thus the total number of receptor samples taken
during r N  The factor q involving 1 2 reects
the quality of each sample When   1  2  0

by the ligand-bound receptor as by the phosphatase and

also that when the backward reactions are faster than the

TRADE-OFFS IN NON-EQUILIBRIUM SENSING
Eq 8 reveals trade-os among the dierent resources
for sensing and between these resources and the accuracy
of sensing
Timereceptor copy numbers
There is no fundamental relationship between recep-
tor copy number and sensing as in equilibrium systems
Essentially the error is determined by the total number
of samples and it does not matter as long as the sam-
ples are independent whether these samples are from the
same receptor over time or from many receptors at the
same time An independent sample of the same recep-
tor can be taken roughly every 2c Eq 7 Naturally
samples can be taken more frequently In fact cells can
time-integrate if XT   the receptors are sampled in-
nitely fast and   0 and Ne   Eq 7 then the
number of independent samples NI taken over r reaches
its maximum the Berg-Purcell factor RT rc and the
error can achieve its minimum 4RT rc However
the benet of sampling faster by increasing XT in re-
ducing the sensing error is rapidly diminishing while the
total protein and energetic costs increase see Fig 3A
Downstream read-out molecules
While the eect of copy number on intrinsic noise has
been studied extensively how copy numbers of read-out
signaling molecules aect the fundamental sensing limit
has not been elucidated
In Eq 8 the factor contain-
ing the chemical potentials is always less than 1 also
nr  XT because the system has relaxed when all read-
out molecules have completed an activation-deactivation
cycle Hence Eq 8 shows that the number of sam-
ples of a ligand-bound receptor p N  is always less than
the number of downstream molecules XT  Each read-
out molecule provides at most one sample because at
any given time it exists in only one modication state
regardless of how many times it has collided with the re-
ceptor or how long the integration time r is There is no
mechanistic sense in which a single molecule integrates
the receptor state As a consequence no matter how the
network is designed how much time or energy it uses or
how many receptors it has cells are fundamentally lim-
ited by the pool of read-out molecules the sensing error

The free-energy drop across a cycle  must be pro-
vided by a fuel molecule such as ATP This free energy
represents the maximum work the fuel molecule could do
if used by an ideal engine Eq 8 denes three regimes
of sensing with respect to the energy consumption of the
network
When   0 the system is in equilibrium and the
sensing error diverges 20 as discussed above indeed
this system employs a fundamentally dierent signaling
strategy than equilibrium systems use to sense Two
other regimes are dened by the work that the fuel
molecules need to do in order to take a sample of the re-
ceptor The power the rate at which the fuel molecules
do work is w  n and the total work performed dur-
ing the relaxation time r is w  wr This work is spent
on taking samples of receptor molecules that are bound to
ligand because only they can modify downstream read-
out molecules The total number of eective samples
of ligand-bound receptors obtained during r is p Ne 
Hence the work needed to take one eective sample of
a ligand-bound receptor is wp Ne  with Ne given by
Eq 8 Fig 3B shows this quantity as a function of 
Two regimes can be observed

the quasi-equilibrium regime 0    4kBT each eective
sample of the bound receptor requires 4kBT which denes the
fundamental lower bound on the energy requirement for tak-
ing a sample When   0 the network is in equilibrium
and both w and N are 0 ATP hydrolysis provides 20kBT
showing that phosphorylation of read-out molecules makes it
possible to store the receptor state reliably The results are
obtained from Eq 8 with 1  2  12 C When
two resources A and B compensate each other one resource
can always be decreased without aecting the sensing error
by increasing the other resource concomitantly increasing a
resource will always reduce the sensing error When both re-
sources are instead fundamental the sensing error is bounded
by the limiting resource and cannot be reduced by increasing
the other resource D E The three resources timereceptor
copies copies of downstream molecules and energy are all
required for sensing with no trade-os among them see Fig

Eqs 9 and 11 show that the sensing precision increases
with the work done in the past relaxation time w  wr
setting up a trade-o among speed power and accuracy
as found in adaptation 18 The trade-o emerges nat-
urally from a molecular picture of sensing When the
response needs to be rapid r needs to be small and
the power demand is high the samples which require
energy must be taken close together in time However
when the cell can wait a long time r before responding
the power w required to make w large can be innitesi-
mal the samples can be created far apart in time There
is no minimum power requirement for sensing
read-out reactions are essentially irreversible and the
sample quality factor q in Eq 8 reaches unity meaning
that each read-out molecule reliably encodes the receptor
state at an earlier time The eective number of samples
therefore equals the total number taken and is given
by that of the irreversible case already studied Ne 
N  nrp  rr  kf xRT r The work per sample of
a ligand-bound receptor wp Ne  equals  because
each sample requires the turnover of one fuel molecule
using  of energy The total number of samples Ne
is thus limited by the work as Ne  nrp  wp
In this regime energy limits sensing not because it limits
the reliability q of each sample but because it limits the
total number of samples Ne that could be taken during
r by limiting the receptor sampling frequency the ux
n increasing n necessarily requires more work Inserting
this expression into Eq 6 and optimizing puts a lower
bound on the sensing error

No trade-os among timereceptors readout
molecules and energy
Intriguingly Eq 9 suggests that for a xed amount of
energy w spent during the relaxation time r the sens-
ing error can be reduced to zero by reducing  to zero
However the lower bound in Eq 9 is only achievable
and Eq 9 thus only applies when  cid38 4kBT
When  cid46 4kBT the system transitions to a quasi-
equilibrium regime in which each fuel molecule provides a
small but nonzero amount of energy In this regime the
system can still consume signicant amounts of energy
when the fuel molecules are consumed at a rapid rate n
by many distinct read-out molecules In the limit that
n   and   0 at xed w  n the eective
number of samples given by Eq 8 reduces to
Ne 
In the quasi-equilibrium regime each readout-receptor
interaction corresponds to an increasingly noisy measure-
ment of the receptor state q  0 but many noisy mea-
surements  N  nrp   contain the same infor-
mation as 1 perfect measurement  provided that col-
lectively at least 4kBT was spent on them
Indeed as
Fig 3B shows 4kBT is the fundamental lower bound
on the work needed to take one accurate sample of a
ligand-bound receptor It puts another lower bound on
the sensing error inserting Eq 10 into Eq 6 and opti-
mizing shows that cid18 c

This power-law bound relates energy to information The

higher and given by Eq 9
The above analysis shows that each of the fundamental
resource categories  timereceptor copy number down-
stream read-out molecules and powertime fuel  has
its own trade-o with sensing accuracy Figs 3CDE

Indeed
one of the most important conclusions of our analysis is
that increasing a single resource eg w cannot reduce
the sensing error indenitely The sensing accuracy will
eventually plateau namely when it becomes fundamen-
tally limited by another resource eg XT  Clearly
there is no trade-o among these classes of resources no
amount of one resource can overcome a limiting amount
of another as illustrated in Figs 3DE The reason is
clear taking a sample requires time and receptors read-
out molecules and fuel Adding receptors and read-out
molecules does not improve sensing if not enough energy
is available to take the samples Fig 3D Similarly wait-
ing more time to take another sample is not benecial if
the cell has no more read-out molecules left to write the
sample to or cannot expend energy fast enough to ac-
complish the writing Fig 3E
The picture that emerges from our analysis is summa-
rized in the lower box of Fig 1 The resource classes
timereceptors downstream readout molecules and en-
ergy act like weak links in a chain that cannot com-
pensate each other in achieving a required sensing pre-
cision Within these classes trade-os are possible time
can be traded against the number of receptors to reach
a required number of measurements while power can be
traded against speed to meet the energy requirement for
a desired sensing accuracy
TRADE-OFFS BETWEEN DIFFERENT MODES
OF SENSING
To increase the number of measurements equilibrium
networks must increase the number of receptors Non-
equilibrium networks may instead use more downstream
readouts and energy to take more measurements with
the same receptors over time Which sensing strategy
is better The strategy adopted by the cell will depend
on the relative tness costs of the dierent resources If
the resources are of similar costs then quantitatively
our analysis predicts that an equilibrium strategy will be
adopted if its minimum error 4RT for non-cooperative
receptors is less than that of the non-equilibrium strat-

timizing this system over all parameters conrms that

equilibrium strategy of catalysis to transmit the signal

ing in these two regimes are the networks that we have
studied a network that combines the two sensing modes
does not perform better than the two individually
DISCUSSION
Fundamentally there are only two distinct mechanisms
to transmit the information from the receptor to the
downstream readout Fig 1 These two mechanisms
described as equilibrium and non-equilibrium sensing
have dierent resource requirements Table I Cells face
a trade-o with respect to their resources in choosing
between these two distinct sensing strategies
In the equilibrium strategy the signal is transmitted
from the receptor to the read-out via sequestration reac-
tions in which binding of an upstream component causes
unbinding of a downstream component or via adaptor
proteins which bind the up- and downstream component
simultaneously Both motifs are ubiquitous in cellular
signaling G-protein-coupled receptor GPCR signaling
employs protein sequestration 33 while Ras signaling
uses adaptor proteins like Grb2 34
Equilibrium systems do not require fuel turnover
They respond to changes in the environment by har-
vesting the energy of ligand binding thereby capitaliz-
ing on the work that is performed by the environment
to change the ligand concentration While the response
speed is determined by the rate constants the accu-
racy of sensing is only limited by their ratio there is no
trade-o between speed and accuracy The sensing pre-
cision is however limited by the number of receptors
This is because the energy of receptor-ligand binding is
used to expel or bind the messenger protein thus cou-
pling receptor-ligand binding to receptor-readout bind-
ing This inevitably leads to correlations between the
extrinsic noise in the receptor and the intrinsic noise of
the processing network 11 These correlations lead to
a fundamental trade-o between these sources of noise in
equilibrium systems
In nonequilibrium sensing fuel turnover allows the re-
ceptor to transmit information as a catalyst This makes
it possible to remove the correlations and the concomi-
tant trade-o between extrinsic and intrinsic noise and
reach a sensing precision that is not limited by the num-
ber of receptors Arguably the most important signal-
ing motif that relies on fuel turnover is the Goldbeter-
Koshland push-pull network studied here This motif is

used in most if not all signal transduction pathways
Our analysis reveals why it may be benecial to use
this energy consuming motif
it makes it possible to
store the history of the receptor state in stable chemical
modication states of downstream molecules In equilib-
rium sensing the stability of the downstream signaling
proteins relies on physical interactions with the recep-
tor molecules which means that the state of the readout
molecules reects the instantaneous state of the recep-
tor In contrast in non-equilibrium sensing the energy
to change the state of the signaling proteins is not pro-
vided by the physical interactions with the receptor but
by the chemical fuel The receptor catalyzes the modi-
cation of the read-out After modication however the
receptor and read-out become decoupled and each read-
out molecule provides a stable memory of the receptor
state when it was modied
It is this feature that al-
lows these non-equilibriums systems to take samples of
the receptor state over time and perform a discrete time
integration This increases the number of measurements
per receptor making it possible to beat the equilibrium
sensing limit set by the number of receptors
Taking samples fundamentally requires time so that
the samples are independent downstream molecules to
store the samples and energy to store them reliably to
protect the coding We nd that at least 4kBT is needed
for reliable encoding quantifying a relationship between
energy and information One of the most widely used
coding strategies is phosphorylation which requires ATP
In vivo ATP hydrolysis provides about 20kBT This
is sucient to take one receptor sample essentially irre-
versibly Fig 3B which means that the quality factor
q reaches unity Readout phosphorylation thus makes it
possible to store the receptor state reliably
Non-equilibrium networks can exhibit more compli-
cated features than those of the simple push-pull mo-
tif as in the MAPK cascade The molecular picture for
time-integration suggests that our results for the push-
pull network hold generally even in these more compli-
cated systems Indeed we nd the same or more severe
resource limitations in cascades and networks with sim-
ple negative or positive feedback SI Text Although
cascades can increase the response time 10 which in-
creases information transfer they do not make sensing
more ecient in terms of energy or readout molecules
One- and two-component signaling networks provide
a case study for the trade-o between equilibrium and
non-equilibrium sensing One-component systems con-
sist of adaptor proteins which can bind an upstream lig-
and and a downstream eector while two-component
systems are similar to the push-pull network studied
here consisting of a kinase receptor and its substrate
Interestingly some adaptor proteins
like RocR con-
tain the same ligand-binding domain as the kinase and
the same eector-binding domain as the substrate of a
two-component system ie NtrB-NtrC 35
been suggested that one-component systems have evolved
into two-component systems to facilitate transfer of sig-
nals from the membrane to the nucleus 35 However
equilibrium networks can also transmit signals across
space Table I Our results thus suggest that these one-
component systems are really alternative equilibrium so-
lutions to the problem of signal transduction selected
because of dierent resource selection pressures
Which resource sets the fundamental limit for non-
equilibrium sensing Although it has often been assumed
that timereceptors are limiting 1 410 our results in
contrast show how the accuracy of sensing can instead
be limited by energy or downstream copy numbers In-
terestingly experiments suggest that some key networks
are not timereceptor limited Cheong et al have mea-
sured the information transmission of several important
networks and have shown that all transmit about 1 bit of
information or less 36 This amount is far less than the
networks would transmit if they were timereceptor lim-
ited see SI Text This suggests that another resource
such as copy numbers of signaling components or energy
limits sensing In such scenarios characterizing the re-
sponse time of the network is less important for under-
standing sensing than characterizing protein expression
levels and their energy usage
It seems natural to expect that the resources which
are limiting sensing are those that aect cell growth
or tness while the resources that are in excess and
thus wasted are those that do not signicantly aect cell
growth or tness This prediction could be tested experi-
mentally for example by studying the growth and chemo-
tactic performance of bacterial populations with dierent
expression levels of functionally and non-functionally sig-
naling proteins 12 To the extent that all resources af-
fect growth evolutionary pressure should tend to drive
systems so that no resource is wasted which occurs when
all are equally limiting Resource-optimal systems sam-
ple the receptor about once per correlation time and use
just enough fuel and downstream molecules to do so
Quantitatively all resources are equally limiting when

In two-component signaling systems including that of

thus predicts that rc  3  4 This prediction can
be tested assuming that the correlation time c of the
receptor-CheA complex is that of receptor-ligand bind-
ing In E coli the lifetime of the active phosphorylated
readout CheYp is l  100ms 2 which means that
r  l3  30ms since about a third of the total amount
of CheY is phosphorylated in steady-state Eq 12 thus
predicts that c  10ms To test this prediction we es-
timate c from the receptor-ligand dissociation rate ko
as c cid39 12ko  p  05 The dissociation constant of
Tar-aspartate receptor-ligand binding KD  01 1M

this yields ko  100  1000s1 and an estimated corre-
lation time c  1  10ms in line with the prediction of
Eq 12
Eq 12 also predicts that the fundamental resources
should vary proportionally to each other across dierent
networks For example the relation predicts that the
lifetime r of the modied state of a readout molecule
should increase ceteris parabus with its expression level
XT  Two-component systems can provide a large-data
set for testing these predictions once kinetic data and
protein expression levels for many of them become avail-
able 42
Our results are also important for synthetic biology
which uses two-component signaling networks as a build-
ing block 43 The design principles instruct how such
networks should be constructed at the molecular level to
minimize resource consumption In turn synthetic net-
works may provide a platform for testing key predictions
A major question in cell signaling is to what extent the
design of signaling pathways is shaped by the same limits
that apply to other sorts of machines and to what extent
they face unique limitations because they are constructed
out of molecular networks The process of sampling a
time series like the receptor state over time denes a
specic familiar computation that could be conducted
by any machine
it is instantiated in the biochemical
system by the readout-receptor pair We nd that the
free-energy drops across the measurement and era-
sure steps 1 and 2 should be identical to min-
imize the energetic cost even though the fuel molecule
need only be involved in one of the reactions preparing
a non-equilibrium state that relaxes via the other This
allocation of energy diers from that typically consid-
ered in the computational literature in which only the
erasure step requires energy 44 In the cellular system
both steps are computational erasures though only the
erasure step erases memory of the receptor state both
steps erase the state of the molecule involved in the col-
lision Interestingly when p  05 the average work to
measure the state of the receptor is 2kBT which is per-
haps surprisingly close to the Landauer bound kBT ln2
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Calculating the sensing error for a biochemical
network
From Eq 1 in the main text the sensing error for a bio-
chemical network depends on the gain and the variance
of the readout molecule For all networks studied in this
paper we have calculated the gains using a mean-eld
approximation for the steady state level of the readout
which is exact for linear networks the base model of the
main text and the base model plus deactivation Except
where otherwise noted we have calculated all variances
using a linear-noise approximation 45 which is again
exact for the linear networks For nonlinear networks
the quality of the approximation improves with system
size it can already be quite good for systems with only
10 copies of each molecule 46 For the base model and
the base model with deactivation we have used tools of
discrete stochastic processes to independently calculate
the error by viewing the signaling network as a system
that samples the receptor state see SI Text
The linear-noise approximation gives the covariance
matrix  for stationary uctuations in species levels as
the solution to the Lyapunov equation

The Langevin approximation to the dynamics of a bio-
chemical network draws on the same framework as the

ations in species copy numbers N as

Cooperativity achieves the fundamental equilibrium

First we show that cooperative binding of the ligand

operatively bind n ligand molecules C  nL cid10 CLn

read-out x to sense the environment We denote the copy
numbers of the Ns species in the system by the vector
N  The copy numbers of R RL and the read-out x
are elements of this vector along with any other species
in the network Since only the receptor binds the lig-
and the distribution for species copy numbers N in the
equilibrium system with Ns species is given in general by

The information the number of bound receptors RL

The extensions to these proofs when multiple types

above by the total number of ligand molecules that can
be bound to receptors at any time LT  If multiple types
of receptors can bind ligand LT is just the total number
of receptors of any type If each receptor molecule binds
more than one ligand molecule LT is just the total num-
ber of receptors times the number of ligand molecules
each receptor can bind
Sensing error of biochemical networks viewed as
discretely sampling the receptor state
In this section we show how the sensing error of the
biochemical network can be calculated by viewing the
network as a discrete sampling process The important
quantities in a sampling protocol are the number of sam-
ples taken and the spacing between them in addition to
the properties of the sampled signal By viewing the bio-
chemical process as a sampling process we mean that the
underlying parameters of the biochemical network aect
the sensing error only insofar as they aect these quanti-
ties or the stochasticity in these quantities The benet
of viewing the network as a sampling process is that the
number of samples and the spacing between them have
intuitive and well-known eects on the sensing error
the more samples the lower the error the further apart
the samples are the more independent they are Per-
haps less well known are the eects on the sensing error
of stochasticity in the number of samples or the spacing
between samples these eects emerge in the process of
determining the error for a discrete sampling protocol
which we do below
We consider the biochemical networks described by the
base model in the main text and the base model plus de-
activation  the push-pull network For the base model
we identied the molecules that had collided with the re-
ceptors as samples since these molecules states reect
the receptor states at the times of their collisions with the
receptor For the base model with deactivation we iden-
tied the molecules that collided with the receptor more
recently than with the phosphatase as samples When we
refer to the number of samples we mean the number of
these molecules when we refer to the times of the sam-
ples we mean the times at which these molecules collided
with the receptor
We begin by rewriting the equation for the sensing er-
ror in a form that makes the connection to discrete sam-
pling explicit Eq 22 below The cell senses its environ-
ment through the level of its readout x However this
is no dierent from estimating the ligand concentration

since N is a constant independent of L Note that the
gain dpdL is dpdL  p1  p
We rst consider the eect of the stochasticity in the
total number of samples N  The law of total variance
allows us to decompose the variance in the estimate p
into terms arising from dierent sources
p  E varpN   var EpN 
The rst term of Eq 20 reects the mean of the variance
in p given the number of samples N  the second term
reects the variance of the mean of p given the number
of samples N 
The mean and variance of p given the number of sam-
ples N are more familiar quantities than their uncondi-
tioned counterparts as we see below Since by denition
the samples reect the state of the receptor at the times
ti of their collisions with the receptor we can write the
number of x at the nal time as
Ncid88

as the error of a statistical sampling protocol in which
exactly N samples are taken at random times ti This
is shown explicitly in the section Error of discrete sam-
pling protocols with a xed number of samples In that
section it is shown that the error for such a sampling
protocol is
cid32cid80N
i1 nti
 p1  p
where fI is the fraction of the samples that are indepen-

term in Eq 22 is just

That is the rst term in Eq 22 is the error of a discrete

the main text The only eect of the expectation in the
rst term is to swap N for N  Dividing by the squared
gain see Eq 19 dpdL  p1 p gives the rst term
in Eq 6 in the main text
We now turn to the second term in Eq 22 From the
law of total variance this term describes how stochas-
ticity in the number of samples N  contributes to the
sensing error Because the number of samples N is Pois-
son with mean and variance equal to N

where the probability a receptor is bound is Enti  p
Dividing by the squared gain gives the second term in Eq
6 in the main text Thus we have derived Eq 6 in the
main text as the result of a discrete sampling protocol
The derivations leading to Eq 22 show that the sam-
pling error for the sampling protocol must be the same as
the sensing error for the biochemical network To check
this we can calculate the sensing error for the biochem-
ical network Eq 6 in the main text in a more stan-
dard way determining the gain and the variance of the
output x and using Eq 1 in the main text We do
where niti denotes the value of the ith sample  the
state of the receptor involved in the ith collision at the
time ti of that collision 1 if bound to ligand 0 otherwise
In the following we consider a single receptor RT  1
and n  ni The results generalize to multiple receptors

The equation is a bit complicated but what is impor-
tant is that it fully species the sensing error in terms
of the number of samples the spacings between them
and the stochasticity in these quantities That is this
equation shows that the sensing error is the error of a
sampling process We can use it to calculate the sens-
ing error independently from for example the master
equation or the linear-noise approximation
this for the base model with deactivation results for the
base model follow similarly The mean level of x is just
x  kf pcid96 The variance in x can be calculated using
standard methods eg the linear-noise approximation

where the last term accounts for the covariance The vari-
ances can be calculated in many ways since the system
is linear For example they can be calculated exactly
via the linear-noise approximation The result is the rst
term of Eq 6 in the main text as claimed Indeed there
is no second term for the model described here This is
precisely because with this scheme the number of sam-
ples N is known While in the scheme of the main text
see Fig 2 the system cannot discriminate between the
molecules that have collided with an unbound receptor
and the molecules that have not collided with the recep-
tor at all in this scheme the system knows exactly how
many collisions there have been with the receptor x 
The origin of the second term in Eq 6 in the main
Error of discrete sampling protocols with a xed
number of samples
The second term in Eq 6 in the main text emerges
in the derivations above as a consequence of the stochas-
ticity in the number of samples N  However it is more
fundamentally a consequence of the fact that the cell does
not distinguish between samples of the unbound recep-
tor from blank samples that do not represent a receptor
state  ie it does not distinguish x molecules that col-
lided with the unbound receptor from those that never
collided with the receptor in any state A more standard
sampling procedure would distinguish between these and
so would estimate p as p  xN  not p  x N  as
above As we show below this procedure gives rise to
only the rst term of Eq 6 in the main text allowing
us to interpret the second term as the price the cell pays
for not distinguishing readout molecules that collide with
the unbound receptor from those that have never collided
with the receptor in any state
One way to arrive at this conclusion is to imagine that
all collisions with the receptor lead to modications of x
Yet while the ligand-bound receptor modies x into state
x the unbound receptor modies x into another state
x Hence in addition to the reaction x  RL  x  RL
we consider the reaction x  R  x  R Then N 
x  x Analogously to Eq 1 in the main text we can
then estimate the variance of p  xN  xx  x
by expanding to rst order

In this section we derive the rst term of Eqs 20
and 22 corresponding to Eq 6 in the main text as the
error of a discrete sampling protocol with a xed number
of samples N taken of receptor states over time The
average receptor occupancy is estimated as
cid88
where niti is the state of the receptor involved in the
ith sample at the time of that sample 1 if the receptor
was bound at time ti and 0 otherwise In what follows
we consider a single receptor RT  1 and nti  niti
The results generalize to multiple receptors The times ti
of the samples represent the times at which the molecules
that store the samples of the receptor collided with the
receptor Therefore we choose the distribution of times
between the samples to match the distribution of times
between those collisions which depends on the particular
network under consideration described below We count
time backwards from the present time t  0 The num-
ber of samples N and the distribution of times at which
they were taken species a sampling protocol indepen-
dent of the chemical implementation

Base model  We rst consider a statistical sam-

a randomly chosen pair of uniformly distributed samples

we have simplied the result with the standard assump-
tion that T cid29 c and N cid29 1 it does not make sense to
discuss the spacing between a single sample
Deactivation To take into account deactivation we
consider sampling times which match the distribution of
the receptor collisions of only those N molecules storing
samples We thus have to take into account that some of
the samples that have been taken are thrown away due to
the deactivation process We begin with an alternative
expression for the expected covariance

sion for the sensing error gives the rst term in Eq 6

here RT  1 We have made the simplifying assump-
tions that N cid29 1 it does not make sense to talk of the
spacing between just one sample and cid96 cid29 c a stan-
dard assumption The eective spacing is not the mean
nearest-neighbor spacing but it is qualitatively similar
and serves to summarize the fact that samples taken fur-
ther apart in time are more independent Clearly from
Eq 45 the error depends on the distribution of all-pairs
spacings not necessarily nearest-neighbor spacings and
it depends on the full distribution not just the mean
Finally we iterate that we can perform an independent
check on the derivation in this section by computing the
sensing error using the linear-noise approximation which
is exact for this linear network As mentioned this gives
exactly the same result
No trade-os among resources
In Fig 3D of the main text we show how the sens-
ing error depends on the pair of resources readout copy
number XT  energy w These results were obtained via
numerical minimization of Eq 6 subject to constraints
on XT and w
In Fig 3E of the main text we show how the sensing
error depends the pair of resources timereceptor copy
number energy The plot for timereceptor copy num-
ber readout copy number is the same In this section
we describe the derivation of the results shown in this
gure In order to consider rc not necessarily large
we need to use a form of the Berg-Purcell bound that is
valid for short integration times 10

showing that the resources do not compensate each other
Additional constraints on the values of rate constants
will generally prevent the network from achieving these
bounds
In particular it is common to consider that
the binding of ligand to receptor is diusion-limited so
is never achieved Of
that the bound 4
course additional constraints cannot improve the per-
formance of the network beyond the bounds required
here nor can they alter the fact that all the resources
are needed for sensing

Additional networks
Networks are often more complicated than a simple
one-level push-pull cascade We investigate some com-
mon motifs to understand whether they relax the trade-
os faced by sensory networks
Multi-level cascades Often the signaling molecule ac-
tivated by the receptor is not taken as the nal read-out
rather that molecule catalyzes the activation of another
molecule and so on in a signaling cascade All of the
molecules are reversibly degraded Using the same ap-
proach as for the one-level cascade we nd that the sens-
ing error is bounded by the work done driving just the
last step of the cascade N  wir
4p  where wi  nii is
the product of the ux of the last molecule through its
cycle and the free-energy drop across that cycle and r is
the slowest relaxation time in the cascade ie the recip-
rocal of the largest eigenvalue of the relaxation matrix
Even more work is done at other levels of the cascade
The results suggest that cascades do not enable more en-
ergy ecient sensing Additionally each sample of an ac-
tive state bound receptor or active molecule upstream
still requires a molecule to store it
Positive and negative feedback  A simple model of pos-
itive feedback is autocatalysis
in which the receptor-
catalyzed activation of the read-out is enhanced by the
activated form of the read-out x x  x  RL cid10
2x  RL A simple model of negative feedback can
be implemented by requiring inactive x for the activa-
tion 2x  RL cid10 x  x  RL In both cases x degrades
according to x cid10 x Neither positive feedback nor nega-
tive feedback changes the energetic requirements for sens-
ing N  n
 As before the free-energy
drops across the reactions were calculated as the ratio of
mass-action propensities

Cooperative activation of the read-out If the catalytic
activation of the read-out is mediated cooperatively by
the receptors ie x  nRL cid10 x  nRL then the error
is reduced by a factor n2 for the same amount of en-
ergy One way to interpret the result is that each sample
requires the same amount of energy as before but the
samples are individually more informative because they
reect n ligand bindings instead of one  indeed the
instantaneous error is lower
Trade-os between equilibrium and non-equilibrium
sensing
To understand how energy shapes the design of a net-
work we modify the push-pull network so that the read-
out actually binds the ligand-bound receptor which can
boot the read-out o in a modied state RLx cid10 RLx
RLx cid10 RL  x The active read-out decays as before
x cid10 x The reaction RLx cid10 RL  x coarse-grains the
reactions RLx cid10 RLx and RLx cid10 RL  x explicitly
adding these reaction gives the same results because they
essentially can always be integrated out This network in-
terpolates between the equilibrium and non-equilibrium
networks considered in the main text Choosing the rate
constants of the booting and decay reactions to be 0 the
network reduces to the sequestration network studied in
the equilibrium section Choosing the rate constants so
that the read-out is rarely bound to the receptor the
network reduces to the push-pull network studied in the
non-equilibrium section No resources are coarse-grained
in these reductions though the latter breaks the retroac-
tivity of receptor-read-out binding energy is required to
break reversibility not retroactivity
We focus on the relationship between the number of
receptors the equilibrium resource and the work a non-
equilibrium resource as the network shifts from binding
to catalysis The work is dened as w  wr as in the
main text where the relaxation time r is chosen as the
negative reciprocal of the smallest eigenvalue of the re-
gression matrix of the network From a scaling argument
and dimensional analysis the relationship between these
resources must take the form
cid18 c
cid192
cid18 wr
cid19
for some function f independent of any parameters
We probe this function numerically Fig 4 The
gure shows results from 25 million explicit parameter
evaluations and from about 25000 numerical minimiza-
tion trials Minimization trials were constrained steepest
descent minimizations randomly initialized for logarith-
mically distributed rate constants between exp15 and
exp15 To promote uniform sampling of the space we
minimized estimation error subject to constraints on the
work we minimized work subject to constraints on the
estimation error and we minimized the product of the
work and the estimation error subject to constraints on
either We also continued the best solutions over varia-
tions in the constraints to probe the global minima
As seen in the gure when the work per receptor is
less than about 1 kBT the equilibrium scheme of bind-
ing is optimal recovering the equilibrium bound for the
sensing error cc2  4RT Eq 2 in the main text
with p  12 When the work per receptor is greater
than about 4 kBT the non-equilibrium scheme of cataly-
sis is optimal recovering the bound from the main text
cc2  4 wr Roughly it only makes sense to use
the nonequilibrium catalysis scheme if the energy budget
is sucient to take more than one sample per receptor
4kBT per sample of the bound receptor since the equi-
librium scheme can take one sample of the bound recep-
tor without any energy Around 1 kBT there is an inter-
mediate regime in which the network outperforms both
these regimes by partially utilizing the bound receptor-
read-out state
Assessing the limiting resource in biochemical
networks
In the main text we argue that the TNF newtork could
transmit much more than one bit if it were timereceptor
limited Here we describe how we arrived at that con-
clusion
Even if the integration time of the network were zero
and the network did not integrate the receptor state it
would still be able to transmit the information in the in-
stantaneous receptor state The information about the
ligand concentration c in the instantaneous receptor oc-
cupancy RLT  is given by
IRLT  c  12 log2 RT 2e
To arrive at this result we calculated the information
transfer of a biochemical system that takes the recep-
tor occupancy and not a downstream readout as the
nal output We assumed simple ligand-binding kinet-
ics R  L cid11 RL and assumed that ligand binding is
not aected by any downstream processes More compli-
cated kinetics eg cooperativity would likely increase
the instantaneous information transfer The result as-
sumes that the ligand-binding kinetics are optimized with
respect to the distribution of input concentrations of the
ligand
the information transfer calculated is the
channel capacity of the network The channel capacity
is the appropriate quantity to consider because it is the
experimentally reported quantity in the paper by 36
We followed the method in 49 to calculate the channel
capacity
TNF signaling utilizes RT  2000 receptors on the cell
surface 50 corresponding to 12 log2 RT 2e  5
bits of information If the network integrates the receptor
state the information could be even higher The fact
that the actual information transfer is instead much less
than 5 bits suggests that receptorstime do not limit the
accuracy of sensing but rather another resource such as
copy numbers of signaling components or energy
The following paragraphs address various nuances to
the above argument First note that restrictions on the
probability distribution of inputs can prevent the system
from achieving the channel capacity This is true both for
our bound and for the calculated information transmis-
sion through the entire network in the paper by Cheong
et al One biologically relevant restriction on the proba-
bility distribution of inputs is the support of the distri-
bution particularly the maximum biologically relevant
concentration of the ligand if achieving the channel ca-
pacity requires input distributions with large probability
for concentrations that are much higher than those bio-
logically observed then the channel capacity is not really
a relevant measure for the capacity of the network Im-
portant in this context is that the dissociation constant
KD for TNF binding is 0323 ngmL 51 about the same
as the half-saturation for the TNF response as measured
by Cheong et al So achieving the channel capacity at
the level of the receptors does not require higher concen-
trations than achieving the channel capacity of the whole
network This means that while restrictions on the max-
imum input concentration would prevent the system from
achieving the channel capacity of 55 bits at the level of
the receptors they would also prevent the system from
achieving the channel capacity of 1 bit at the level of the
output maintaining the discrepancy
The above arguments assume that a the principal role
of the signaling network is to time integrate the recep-
tor and b that this improves information transmission if
energy and the copy numbers of the signaling molecules
are not limiting and the network is hence not too noisy
However signaling systems with enough fuel and signal-
ing molecules that time-integrate the receptor do not
necessarily increase information transmission They can
also reduce information transmission by collapsing many
input states onto the same output state This can hap-
pen when the input-output relation is strongly non-
linear However the experimental data in the paper by
Cheong et al suggest that this is not the case for the
TNF network as the response increases mono-modally
and gradually with the input In fact the output is also
noisy Indeed the authors attribute the loss of informa-
tion transmission to biochemical noise which according
to our analysis could be due to limiting amounts of read-
out molecules or energy
A nal note is that while the above arguments show
that the number of receptors and time are not limit-
ing and suggest that downstream molecules or energy
are limiting it is cannot be ruled out that other sources
of noise which we have not modeled are instead limit-
ing For example the sensing precision could be limited
by cell-to-cell variability in the copy numbers of signal-
ing molecules expression or capacity noise 52 These
could even involve variations in the number of recep-
tors themselves However back-of-the-envelop calcula-
tions suggest that such variations are not enough to ex-
plain the discrepancy above Moreover many biological
systems including some two-component systems are in-
sulated against uctuations in protein expression 53
supporting the idea that in these cases energy or protein
copy numbers are indeed limiting the accuracy of sensing
