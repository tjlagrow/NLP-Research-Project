The common interpretation of the Hawking radiation as quantum tunneling has some ambiguity
such as coordinate-dependence of tunneling rate and non-invariance of the action under canonical
transformations It is shown that the tunneling process of black holes can be successfully described
by Rindler coordinates in analogy with the Schwinger mechanism for pair production We study
the tunneling process of a charged black hole and a BTZ black hole

INTRODUCTION
More than a quarter century ago Hawking discovered
that black holes could radiate thermal radiations with the
Hawking temperature determined by the surface grav-
ity at the event horizon 1 The surface gravity is the
acceleration of a static particle just outside the event
horizon as measured at the spatially innity Also Un-
ruh observed that a uniformly accelerated particle would
experience a thermal state from the Minkowski vacuum
with the temperature determined by the acceleration 2
Since then there have been many attempts to derive or
reinterpret the Hawking radiation
Recently the study of the Hawking radiation has been
revived partly because the Hawking radiation could be
derived from the motion of spherically emitted radiation
including the back reaction of radiation 3 and partly be-
cause quantum tunneling of uctuations or waves across
the event horizon could lead to the Hawking radiation
4 In both cases the imaginary part of action was re-
sponsible for tunneling of Hawking radiation
Hawking radiation was originally derived by calculat-
ing the amplitude ratio of an outgoing wave to an in-
coming wave scattered by the event horizon The recent
quantum tunneling interpretation diers from the early
interpretation in that quantum uctuations just inside
the horizon can cross the horizon and the tunneling am-
plitude determines the Boltzmann distribution for Hawk-
ing radiation 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18

19 However there is some am-
biguity in the tunneling interpretation of Hawking radi-
ation 16 The Boltzmann distribution depends on the
coordinates used to express the eld equation For in-
stance the Schwarzschild coordinate leads to a temper-
ature twice of the Hawking temperature
In this paper we show that the Rindler coordinates cor-
rectly provide the tunneling rate for Hawking radiation
and resolve the ambiguity We then apply the method
to a charged black hole and a BTZ black hole The

idea is based on the observation that the eld equation
in the Rindler coordinates of a non-extremal black hole
takes a similar form as the eld equation in an exter-
nal electric eld for the Schwinger mechanism 20
the space-dependent Coulomb gauge the eld equation
conceptually leads to the tunneling problem in which
virtual pairs of charged particles in the Dirac sea ex-
perience a potential barrier lowered by the electric eld
21 22 23 24 25 26 Further the tunneling rate is given
by an instanton action in the complex plane 24 25 The
tunneling rate expressed by a contour integral in the com-
plex plane is invariant under canonical transformations
The organization of this paper is as follows In Sec II
we briey review the Schwinger mechanism and introduce
the tunneling rate as a contour in the complex plane
In Sec III the tunneling rate for Hawking radiation is
formulated as a contour integral in Rindler coordinates
of black holes We then apply the formula to a charged
black hole and a BTZ black hole
II SCHWINGER MECHANISM AND
INSTANTON ACTIONS
Schwinger used the proper-time method to calculate
the eective action of a charged particle in an external
electromagnetic eld and found an imaginary part for a
uniform electric eld 20 This leads to the vacuum de-
cay through pair production The Schwinger mechanism
for pair production by an external eld can be physically
understood as follows Virtual pairs of charged particles
from vacuum uctuations can be separated to become
real pairs when the potential energy over the Compton
wavelength is greater than or equal to the rest mass en-
In the tunneling interpretation the virtual pairs
pass through the potential barrier lowered by the electric
eld 21 22 23 24 25 26 Roughly speaking the bar-
rier width is inversely proportional to the strength of the
electric eld
The similarity between the Schwinger mechanism and
the Hawking radiation has been studied for many years
5 22 23 A naive interpretation would be separation of
virtual pairs by an electric eld in the former and by the
real axis

FIG 1 The contour C in the complex x-plane excluding a
branch cut connecting two roots for tunneling
event horizon in the latter Another interpretation would
be that virtual pairs accelerate by the electric eld and
these pairs would feel thermal state from the Minkowski
vacuum Likewise the Hawking radiation may be inter-
preted as the Unruh eect of a static particle just outside
the horizon with the acceleration of the surface gravity
measured at the innity 2 In fact the Rindler space-
time of the accelerated particle also has the horizons
Now we further elaborate the analogy between the
Schwinger mechanism and the Hawking radiation A dif-
ference from other studies is that the Hawking radiation
is interpreted as quantum tunneling in the same way as
the Schwinger mechanism We observe that for instance
the Klein-Gordon equation for charged boson pairs in the
space-dependent Coulomb gauge takes the same form
as the eld equation in the Rindler coordinates of black
holes Each Fourier mode becomes a tunneling problem
the sub-barrier penetration The essence of the instan-
ton action method is that the tunneling states of this
equation lead to the vacuum decay and pair production
of charged particles 24 25 A similar form of tunneling
rate is provided by the worldline instanton 26
A constant electric eld along the x-direction has the
space-dependent gauge potential A  Ex 0 The
Fourier mode of the Klein-Gordon equation for charge e
e  0 and mass  takes the form in units with   c 
1 and with metric signature

In quantum mechanics Eq 1 is a tunneling problem
with the inverted potential barrier qx and qx cor-
responds to p2
x in the WKB approximation Using the
phase-integral formula 27 the wave function can be
written as
x  Af  Bf 
where fx is an asymptotic solution with unit incoming
ux and

Here the action can also be dened in the complex x-
plane by the contour integral 25

where the integral is along the contour in Fig 1
Now we turn to quantum tunneling of Hawking radia-
tion Let us rst consider a charged black hole with mass

Here r  m  pm2  q2 is the outer inner horizon
The surface gravity is

from which follows the Hawking temperature

The solution of the form   eitiSr may describe

zon r The positive negative sign is for an outgoing

The imaginary part obtained by taking a semi-circle

Then the tunneling rate is given by
P   e 
  eT 
Here the temperature T   is the twice of the Hawk-
ing temperature 8 This ambiguity is closely related
with coordinates used to calculate the tunneling rate
Several ways have been proposed so far to remedy this
discrepancy such as the ratio of emission to absorption
5 and a proper distance along the radial direction 10
Another ambiguity is that the action 10 and the imag-
inary part is not invariant under canonical transforma-
tions 16
We calculate the tunneling rate of s-waves two-
dimensional sector in Rindler coordinates of a non-
extremal charged black hole and a BTZ black hole In-
troducing r  R drf r we write the metric in a con-
formal spacetime
ds2  f rdt2  dr2
where the Regge-Wheeler coordinate for a non-extremal
black hole m2  q2 is
r  r 
r  r
lnr  r 
r  r

Then the spatial part of the scalar   eitr
takes the form
r2  qri  0
qr  2  2f r15
The waves particles can be observed at spatial innity
only for   m From the analogy with the Schwinger
mechanism the tunneling rate imaginary part of the ac-
tion is determined by the contour integral in the complex
r-plane
S  iIC pqrdr
Here the contour integral is taken the inside of C in con-
trast with the outside of C in Sec II
However as the simple pole occurs at r   the
contour integral 16 may not be appropriate for practical
calculations Instead in the Rindler coordinate
r2 x2
the black hole spacetime becomes

where m  r  r2  pm2  q2 Near the event
horizon the spacetime 18 approximately takes the form
of ds2  x2dt2dx2 a Rindler spacetime with accel-
eration  We extend the right wedge of the Minkowski
spacetime 18 exterior to the horizon to the left wedge
which is an analytical continuation of the interior to the
horizon The simple pole is located at x  0 Now the
action for tunneling
S  iIC pqx
leads to the tunneling rate
P   eS  eTH 
We compare with other coordinates In Ref
10 the
proper distance is used as a coordinate to calculate the
tunneling rate The proper distance   R drf  mea-
sured from the event horizon is
  pr  rr  r
m lncid16 r  m pr  rr  r
cid17
Then the two-dimensional metric near the event horizon
ds2  2dt2  d2
is the Rindler spacetime This is the reason why the
proper distance method recovers the correct tunneling
rate On the other hand the isotropic coordinate dened
rpf r
  m2  q2
2  r
where   c and c is a constant Later we choose c 
rm to match the isotropic spacetime near the horizon
with the Rindler spacetime The metric is

  m2  q2  2r  r
  m2  q2
  m2  q2  2r  r
  m2  q2
 2  r2 d2
m2  m2  q22
Near the horizon it becomes again the Rindler spacetime
witt the acceleration  Thus the isotropic coordinates
also recover the correct result
Finally we consider the BTZ black hole with the metric

The BTZ black hole has the outer inner horizon at

d  jdt2r2 describes a rotation For the s-wave the
angular part does not play any role The remaining two-
dimensional sector can be treated in a similar way In-
troducing the coordinate

IV CONCLUSION
We critically reviewed the current study of the Hawk-
ing radiation as quantum tunneling
The common
method to calculate the tunneling rate of a eld across
the event horizon has been confronted with two ambi-
guities
the coordinate-dependence of the action and
the temperature dierent from the Hawking temperature
16 Though some prescriptions have been put forth such
as the proper distance and the ratio of emission to ab-
sorption the proper choice of coordinate has been an
issue of debate
In this paper we used the Rindler coordinates as an
appropriate spacetime to describe the tunneling problem
of waves across the event horizon in the black hole space-
time The reasons are that tunneling occurs across the
event horizon and the tunneling rate is determined by
the geometric property at the horizon while the Rindler
spacetime approximately describes the spacetime near
the horizon Further the Hawking radiation can be in-
terpreted as the Unruh eect of an observer accelerating
with the surface gravity Another interesting observa-
tion is that the eld equation in a Rindler spacetime is
reminiscent of the eld equation for the Schwinger mech-
anism The rate of pair production is obtained by a con-
tour integral of the action in the complex plane and sim-
ilarly the tunneling rate for black hole is given by the
contour integral in the complex plane of the Rindler co-
ordinate
We applied the tunneling rate in the form of contour
integral to a charged black hole and a BTZ black hole
In both cases the black hole has the Rindler coordinates
in an explicit form except for the extremal black hole
Our tunneling formula leads to the correct Boltzmann
distribution and the Hawking temperature Further this
formula avoids the ambiguity of tunneling interpretation
A caveat is that the formula cannot be applied to the
extremal black hole because it does not have a Rindler
spacetime near the horizon The Hawking temperature
vanishes there and thus no Hawking radiation The de-
velopment of eld theoretical interpretation of tunneling
in Rindler coordinates and applications to other black
holes will be addressed in a future publication 28
