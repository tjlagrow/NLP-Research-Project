Abstract
In this paper we introduce the methodology used and
the basic phases we followed to develop the Catalan WordNet
and which lexical resources have been employed in its building
This  methodology  as  well  as  the  tools  we  made  use  of  have
been thought in a general way so that they could be applied to
any other language
1 Introduction
In  recent  years  the  research  in  the  Natural
Language Processing NLP field has proved the need for
extensive  and  complete  Lexical  Knowledge  Bases
LKBs  Acquiring  such  lexicalsemantic  structures  is  a
hard  problem  and  has  been  usually  approached  by
reusing  merging  and  tuning  existing  lexical  material
While in English the lexical  bottleneck  problem  seems
to  be  softened  eg  WordNet  Miller  1990  Alvey
Lexicon Grover et al 1993 COMLEX Grishman et al
1994  and  so  on  there  are  no  available  wide  range
lexicons 
languages  Manual
construction of lexicons is the most reliable technique for
obtaining  structured  lexicons  but  it  is  costly  and  highly
time-consuming This is the reason for  many  researchers
to  have  focussed  on  the  massive  acquisition  of  lexical
knowledge  and  semantic  information  from  pre-existing
structured  lexical  resources  as  automatically  as  possible
The  work  presented  here  shows  a  fast  production
methodology to build large scale multilingual LKBs from
conventional dictionaries
for  other 
for  NLP 
In  this  way  the  English  WordNet  developed  at
Princeton  University  is  consolidating  as  a  standard  de
facto for the lexical-semantic representation of the natural
language  for  English  Considering  this  English  WordNet
as a reference new WordNets in some other languages are
being built such as the ones for Galician Basque Spanish
and  Catalan  for  instance  Besides  multilingual  links  are
established  automatically  through  the  connections  with
the English WordNet
The research we are now presenting is embedded
in the Catalan WordNet project which is being carried out
by  the  Grup  de  Tractament  de  Llenguatge  Natural
GTLN-UPC-UB  of 
the  Centre  de  Referncia  en
Enginyeria Lingstica CREL2
                                                          
1  The  members  of  the  GTLN-UPC-UB  group  Grup  de
Tractament  de  Llenguatge  Natural  are  from  the  Universitat
Politcnica  de  Catalunya  and  from 
the  Universitat  de
Barcelona
2 The research reported in this paper was carried out within the
context  of  the  projects  ITEM  TIC96-1243-C03-03  EWN
The  aim  of  this  paper  is  then  to  show  the
methodology  followed  for  the  building  of  the  Catalan
WordNet  as  well  as  which  available  resources  we  took
advantage of and which ones we had to develop
The  Catalan  WordNet  is  a  monolingual  lexical
knowledge  base  which  initially  follows  WordNet  model
developed  at  Princeton3  but  it  is  going  to  be  adapted  to
the  EuroWordNet4  model  In  WordNet  the  concepts  are
defined  as  synonymy  sets  called  synsets  linked  one  each
other through semantic relations hypernymy hyponymy
meronymy  antonymy  and  so  on  The  grammatical
categories  represented  in  WordNet  are  nouns  verbs
adjectives and adverbs At present we are working on the
nouns and verbs representation
the  noun  concepts  and 
This paper is organized in three parts Firstly it
describes  the  methods  which  managed  the  automatic
extraction  of 
their  further
validation  section  21  as  well  as  the  methodology  for
the  verbal  concepts  Secondly  it  explains  the  developed
computing  tools  In  fact  it  describes  the  design  of  the
database section 31 and the interface which allows the
user to consult and modify the Catalan WordNet section
32  Finally  some  conclusions  are  drawn  and  we
comment the main results besides further research on the
topic section 4
2 Development Of The Catalan Wordnet
As  we  previously  mentioned 
the  Catalan
Wordnet  is  a  monolingual  lexical  knowledge  base
Although  its  final  aim  is  the  representation  of  nouns
verbs  adjectives  and  adverbs  this  first  stage  has  been
focused in the treatment of noun and verbal concepts as
the Catalan WordNet has followed the same methodology
which was  applied  to Spanish WordNet5 Lets see how
these concepts are defined in WordNet
The  nouns  or  nominal  concepts  are  organized
hierarchycally  which  hangs  from  several  nodes  from
which    the  rest  of  nodes  are  connected  directly  or
indirectly through the semantic relation of hyponymy The
verbs  are  arranged  hierarchically  through  the  relation  of
                                                                                              
LE2-4003  and  CREL  it  is  one  of  the  centers  of  the
Generalitat de Catalunya that states references for research and
development
3 Concretely the WordNet version is 15
4 EuroWordNet LE2-4003 this project aims to develop a generic
multilingual  database  with  WordNets  for  several  European
languages
5 ITEM TIC96-1243-C03-03 the main aim of this project is to
explore and evaluate to which extend the use of NLP techniques
the  processes  of 
information  recovery  and
extraction 
textual  or  multimedia  systems  enabling  a
multilingual access to them
improve 
troponymy and are classified into different semantic fields
verbs  of  communication  movement  state  change  and
so on
Taking  into  account  the  methodology  of  the
EuroWordNet  project  a  set  of  base  concepts  has  been
generated  These  are  considered  the  most  important
concepts  which  are  also  common  to  all  the  languages
involved in this project6 This set of base concepts are put
to  use  as  the  starting  point  for  the  construction  of  the
Catalan  WordNet  To  be  exact  they  are  a  total  of  793
base  noun  concepts  and  228  base  verbal  concepts
translated by hand The aim is to try to assure that any of
the  nodes  in  the  hierarchy  is  connected  directly  or
indirectly to one of these base concepts
Next we will explain the methodology employed
in  extracting  generating  and  validating  the  noun  and
verbal concepts which are not base concepts
21 Noun Concepts
from  machine 
The generation of noun concepts  has  been  done
automatically 
readeable  versions  of
bilingual  dictionaries  following  Atserias  et  al  1997  In
this  project  the  Diccionari  Angls-Catal  Catal-Angls
de la Enciclopdia Catalana DEC 1996 has been used
All the possible pairs of English word - Catalan word  are
taken out of this concrete dictionary so that they could be
connected  to  the  synsets  of  WordNet  Bentez  et  al  a
1998  Once  we  obtained  these  pairs  some  methods  are
applied  to  generate  this  set  of  three  elements  Catalan
word - English word - synset and to disambiguate them in
relation to Wordnet Such methods are the class methods
Atserias et al 1997 Their application consists in doing a
complete and discrete partition of the set of pairs Catalan
word - English word into 4 disjoint subsets
a  In  the  first  of  these  subsets  there  are  the
Catalan Words CW which have only one translation into
a  unique  English  Word  EW  and  besides  this  EW  can
only be translated into that CW
Figure 1 Criterion 1
b  In  the  second  one  there  are  the  CWs  which
have more than one translation into English and each one
of these EWs can only be translated into that unique CW
Figure 2 Criterion 2
                                                          
6  The  languages  involved  in  the  EuroWordNet  project  are
English Spanish Italian and Dutch The base concepts has been
extracted  by  means  of  the  evaluation  of    the  frequencies  from
textual 
from  Machine  Readeable
Dictionaries
and  genus 
corpora 
c In the third subset we find the EWs which
have only one translation into a unique CW and besides
this CW can only be translated into that EW
Figure 3 Criterion 3
d  Finally  in  the  fourth  one  there  are  the  CWs
which have more than one translation into EWs and every
one of these EWs is translated into more than one CW
Figure 4 Criterion 4
Subsequently  the  set  of  English  word  -  synset
pairs  is  divided  into  two  subsets  the  one  of  monosemic
pairs and that of polysemic ones Then these two subsets
of  English  word  -  synset  are  joined  with  those  four
Catalan  word  -  English  word  subsets  As  a  result  we
obtain  8  new  groups  of  sets  of  three  elements  Catalan
word - English word - synset where the  English  word is
the  same  in  every  two  joined  subsets  Bentez  et  al  b
19987
Up to here we have explained the application of
monosemic  and  polysemic  criteria  of  the  class  methods
We  have  also  used  the  variant  criterion  an  hybrid
criterion from the class methods which consists in linking
Catalan words to synsets The link is established when the
synset contains a set of English words and two or more of
these  English  words  have  as  a  translation  the  same
Catalan word
Figure 5 Variant criterion
From  each  of  those  obtained  9  sets  a  representative
random sample has been extracted and validated by hand
in  order 
to  calculate  every  confidence  score  The
reliability  obtained  from  the  sample  is  assigned  to  the
whole set We have validated  1515 out of  49069 Catalan
word - English word - synset links in this thorough way
                                                          
7 In this paper we can see the practical application of the class
methods explained in the paper Combining Multiple Methods for
the Automatic Construction of Multilingual WordNets Atserias
et al 1997 as well as an implementation with Unix tools
The  subsets  with  a  confidence  score  over  85  
have been added to the noun concepts in order to increase
the Catalan WordNet
Criteria
variant
synsets
Table 1 Results of class methods
At the present the  represented  noun  synsets  are
7509 which means 6961 noun forms and 10705 links
22 Verbal Concepts
The  methodology  employed  in  representing  the
verbal concepts has been slightly different from the one in
the  noun  concepts  Bearing 
the  accented
polysemy  we  can  find  in  the  verbs  and  considering  the
lower  number  of  verbs  too  a  complete  manual  building
was chosen
in  mind 
On one side and thanks to the Pirpides8 project
where some of the members of our team took part a list
of English verbs was available being these ones classified
semantically  as  in  the  proposal  of  Beth  Levin9  Levin
1993  with  their  translations  into  Spanish  and  Catalan
On  the  other  side  the  professor  Bonnie  Dorr  at  the
Maryland  University  kindly  provided  us  with 
correspondence English verb - Levin class -  synset Dorr
et al 1997 From these two lists the link Catalan verb -
synset  was  generated  automatically  before  we  validated
every link carefully
The  total  amount  of  verbal  concepts  is  3244
which  means  a  whole  of  3359  verbal  forms  and  9121
3 Software
The  Catalan  WordNet  is  being  modifying  and
updating constantly What is more all these changes have
to  be  done  by  any  of  the  members  of  our  group  at  the
same time This is why we need a database which assures
the  integrity  of  the  information  contained  and  this
simultaneous access in short its consistency To make the
user  work  easier  a  friendly  interface  has  been  created
Firstly this one allows the user to search and manipulate
the data easily and effectively The user also can consult
multilingual  data  and  have  an  intuitive  view  of  the
hierarchy  of  the  synsets  Secondly  some  lexical  data
                                                          
8  Pirpides  is  a  project  in  which  the  Universitat  de  Barcelona
Universitat  Autnoma de  Barcelona  Universitat  de  Lleida  and
Universidad de San Sebastin take part Its main aim is to create
lexical corpora for natural language processing and dictionaries
of use
9 The verbal classification proposed by Beth Levin is based on
the  hypothesis  which  states  that  the  syntactic  behaviour  is
determined  by  the  meaning  of  a  verb  therefore  it  is  useful  to
study the diathesis alternations to classify verbs semantically
mainly  monolingual  and  bilingual  dictionaries  are
available
31Database
To minimize the developing expenses and to let
the free access to the data a freeware database the  Mini
SQL  de  Hughes  Technologies10  Mini  SQL  was  used
This  one  can  be  installed  in  any  Unix  system  including
Linux and offers Application Program Interfaces  APIs
for the main computing languages
The  main  objectives  in  the  relational  database
design  are  the  storage  of  the  general  information  of  the
different WordNets as well as to keep all this information
in a well defined structure Bentez et al c 1998 At the
moment  our  design  includes  the  complete  loading  of
WordNet 15 which means the following
a The synsets and their related information the gloss
the  semantic  field  and  the  total  amount  of  direct
and indirect hyponyms
b  the  different  meanings  of  every  word  and  its
connection to the synset and
c  the  semantic  relations  stored  as  connections  for
synsets 
  hyperonymy  hyponymy  antonymy
meronymy  holonymy  attribute  cause  and
entailment
But for the rest of WordNets we kept
a the meanings of every word with its connection  to
the  synset  in  WordNet  15  besides  the  reliability
obtained through the methods explained in section
b the gloss related to the synset
Right now the semantic relations in WordNet 15
form the skeleton of the hierarchy of all the WordNets in
the system The multilingual connection of the meanings
of the words is also done through the synsets The present
loaded  WordNets  are  fragments  of  the  Spanish  Basque
and Catalan ones
Integrating new WordNets in new languages can
be easily done and the structure of the database allows to
develop  exporting  software  easily  too  Actually  a
prototype  for  exporting  monolingual  Wordnets  capable
for the tools11 in EuroWordNet Novell 1996-1998  has
already been implemented
32 The Interface
In  order  to  build  the  Catalan  WordNet  or  any
other monolingual WordNet it is necessary the creation of
an accessing interface to the database and to the different
available lexical resources  Due to the  physical  distance
between  the different members of the project who handle
the  data  and  to  allow  any  user  to  consult  it  openly  the
interface  has  been  developed  to  work  through  the  Web
Bentez et al cd 1998
The  operations  the  interface  offers  are  the
following
  Consult  Multilingual  WordNet  Its  main  goal  is  to
aid  the  checking  of  errors  and  gaps  in  the  hierarchic
arrangement of the different WordNets To make this
possible  the  interface  shows  the  path  through  the
semantic  hierarchy  of  one  of  the  WordNets  for  any

semantic relation having as a starting point a synset a
sense or a word of one of the available languages
  Edit  Multilingual  WordNet  Obviously  its  basic
target is the edition of the words and glosses of all of
the WordNets except for those of  WordNet 15 For
every verb it is also possible to edit its corresponding
Levin semantic classes see section 22
  Consult  Lexical  Resources  It  allows  to  consult  the
different bilingual and  monolingual  dictionaries  This
information  is  not  storaged  in  the  database  but  into
text  files  At  the  moment  these  lexical  resources
availables for Catalan are the Diccionari general de la
llengua  catalana  Fabra  1984  and  the  Diccionari
bsic  catal-angls  angls-catal  de  lEnciclopdia
Catalana DEC 1996
  Edit  Statistics  This  option  shows  an  historic  list  of
the changes and updates done through the interface
automatic  and  complementary  techniques  for  linking
Catalan words collected from bilingual MRDs for nouns
and lexicons for verbs to English WordNet synsets  As
the Catalan WordNet produced in this way is neither error
free  nor  complete  we  implemented  a  Web  interface
allowing  manual  interaction  that  is  consulting  and
editing with the multilingual WordNet Currently due to
the  smaller  coverage    we  achieved  by  mapping  the
CatalanEnglish bilingual  MRD  compared  to  the  size  of
WordNet15 we are planning to join Catalan taxonomies
acquired automatically from a monolingual MRD Rigau
et  al  1997  The  results  show  that  the  construction  of
multilingual  LKBs  can  be  performed  quickly  using  a
mixed methodology That is building a multilingual LKB
derived  from  bilingual  MRDs  by  using  automatic
procedures  and  then  performing  in  a  second  stage  a
manual refinement of the acquired data

Abstract
In this paper we introduce the methodology used and
the basic phases we followed to develop the Catalan WordNet
and which lexical resources have been employed in its building
This  methodology  as  well  as  the  tools  we  made  use  of  have
been thought in a general way so that they could be applied to
any other language
1 Introduction
In  recent  years  the  research  in  the  Natural
Language Processing NLP field has proved the need for
extensive  and  complete  Lexical  Knowledge  Bases
LKBs  Acquiring  such  lexicalsemantic  structures  is  a
hard  problem  and  has  been  usually  approached  by
reusing  merging  and  tuning  existing  lexical  material
While in English the lexical  bottleneck  problem  seems
to  be  softened  eg  WordNet  Miller  1990  Alvey
Lexicon Grover et al 1993 COMLEX Grishman et al
1994  and  so  on  there  are  no  available  wide  range
lexicons 
languages  Manual
construction of lexicons is the most reliable technique for
obtaining  structured  lexicons  but  it  is  costly  and  highly
time-consuming This is the reason for  many  researchers
to  have  focussed  on  the  massive  acquisition  of  lexical
knowledge  and  semantic  information  from  pre-existing
structured  lexical  resources  as  automatically  as  possible
The  work  presented  here  shows  a  fast  production
methodology to build large scale multilingual LKBs from
conventional dictionaries
for  other 
for  NLP 
In  this  way  the  English  WordNet  developed  at
Princeton  University  is  consolidating  as  a  standard  de
facto for the lexical-semantic representation of the natural
language  for  English  Considering  this  English  WordNet
as a reference new WordNets in some other languages are
being built such as the ones for Galician Basque Spanish
and  Catalan  for  instance  Besides  multilingual  links  are
established  automatically  through  the  connections  with
the English WordNet
The research we are now presenting is embedded
in the Catalan WordNet project which is being carried out
by  the  Grup  de  Tractament  de  Llenguatge  Natural
GTLN-UPC-UB  of 
the  Centre  de  Referncia  en
Enginyeria Lingstica CREL2
                                                          
1  The  members  of  the  GTLN-UPC-UB  group  Grup  de
Tractament  de  Llenguatge  Natural  are  from  the  Universitat
Politcnica  de  Catalunya  and  from 
the  Universitat  de
Barcelona
2 The research reported in this paper was carried out within the
context  of  the  projects  ITEM  TIC96-1243-C03-03  EWN
The  aim  of  this  paper  is  then  to  show  the
methodology  followed  for  the  building  of  the  Catalan
WordNet  as  well  as  which  available  resources  we  took
advantage of and which ones we had to develop
The  Catalan  WordNet  is  a  monolingual  lexical
knowledge  base  which  initially  follows  WordNet  model
developed  at  Princeton3  but  it  is  going  to  be  adapted  to
the  EuroWordNet4  model  In  WordNet  the  concepts  are
defined  as  synonymy  sets  called  synsets  linked  one  each
other through semantic relations hypernymy hyponymy
meronymy  antonymy  and  so  on  The  grammatical
categories  represented  in  WordNet  are  nouns  verbs
adjectives and adverbs At present we are working on the
nouns and verbs representation
the  noun  concepts  and 
This paper is organized in three parts Firstly it
describes  the  methods  which  managed  the  automatic
extraction  of 
their  further
validation  section  21  as  well  as  the  methodology  for
the  verbal  concepts  Secondly  it  explains  the  developed
computing  tools  In  fact  it  describes  the  design  of  the
database section 31 and the interface which allows the
user to consult and modify the Catalan WordNet section

comment the main results besides further research on the
topic section 4
2 Development Of The Catalan Wordnet
As  we  previously  mentioned 
the  Catalan
Wordnet  is  a  monolingual  lexical  knowledge  base
Although  its  final  aim  is  the  representation  of  nouns
verbs  adjectives  and  adverbs  this  first  stage  has  been
focused in the treatment of noun and verbal concepts as
the Catalan WordNet has followed the same methodology
which was  applied  to Spanish WordNet5 Lets see how
these concepts are defined in WordNet
The  nouns  or  nominal  concepts  are  organized
hierarchycally  which  hangs  from  several  nodes  from
which    the  rest  of  nodes  are  connected  directly  or
indirectly through the semantic relation of hyponymy The
verbs  are  arranged  hierarchically  through  the  relation  of
                                                                                              
LE2-4003  and  CREL  it  is  one  of  the  centers  of  the
Generalitat de Catalunya that states references for research and
development
3 Concretely the WordNet version is 15
4 EuroWordNet LE2-4003 this project aims to develop a generic
multilingual  database  with  WordNets  for  several  European
languages
5 ITEM TIC96-1243-C03-03 the main aim of this project is to
explore and evaluate to which extend the use of NLP techniques
the  processes  of 
information  recovery  and
extraction 
textual  or  multimedia  systems  enabling  a
multilingual access to them
improve 
troponymy and are classified into different semantic fields
verbs  of  communication  movement  state  change  and
so on
Taking  into  account  the  methodology  of  the
EuroWordNet  project  a  set  of  base  concepts  has  been
generated  These  are  considered  the  most  important
concepts  which  are  also  common  to  all  the  languages
involved in this project6 This set of base concepts are put
to  use  as  the  starting  point  for  the  construction  of  the
Catalan  WordNet  To  be  exact  they  are  a  total  of  793
base  noun  concepts  and  228  base  verbal  concepts
translated by hand The aim is to try to assure that any of
the  nodes  in  the  hierarchy  is  connected  directly  or
indirectly to one of these base concepts
Next we will explain the methodology employed
in  extracting  generating  and  validating  the  noun  and
verbal concepts which are not base concepts
21 Noun Concepts
from  machine 
The generation of noun concepts  has  been  done
automatically 
readeable  versions  of
bilingual  dictionaries  following  Atserias  et  al  1997  In
this  project  the  Diccionari  Angls-Catal  Catal-Angls
de la Enciclopdia Catalana DEC 1996 has been used
All the possible pairs of English word - Catalan word  are
taken out of this concrete dictionary so that they could be
connected  to  the  synsets  of  WordNet  Bentez  et  al  a
1998  Once  we  obtained  these  pairs  some  methods  are
applied  to  generate  this  set  of  three  elements  Catalan
word - English word - synset and to disambiguate them in
relation to Wordnet Such methods are the class methods
Atserias et al 1997 Their application consists in doing a
complete and discrete partition of the set of pairs Catalan
word - English word into 4 disjoint subsets
a  In  the  first  of  these  subsets  there  are  the
Catalan Words CW which have only one translation into
a  unique  English  Word  EW  and  besides  this  EW  can
only be translated into that CW
Figure 1 Criterion 1
b  In  the  second  one  there  are  the  CWs  which
have more than one translation into English and each one
of these EWs can only be translated into that unique CW
Figure 2 Criterion 2
                                                          
6  The  languages  involved  in  the  EuroWordNet  project  are
English Spanish Italian and Dutch The base concepts has been
extracted  by  means  of  the  evaluation  of    the  frequencies  from
textual 
from  Machine  Readeable
Dictionaries
and  genus 
corpora 
c In the third subset we find the EWs which
have only one translation into a unique CW and besides
this CW can only be translated into that EW
Figure 3 Criterion 3
d  Finally  in  the  fourth  one  there  are  the  CWs
which have more than one translation into EWs and every
one of these EWs is translated into more than one CW
Figure 4 Criterion 4
Subsequently  the  set  of  English  word  -  synset
pairs  is  divided  into  two  subsets  the  one  of  monosemic
pairs and that of polysemic ones Then these two subsets
of  English  word  -  synset  are  joined  with  those  four
Catalan  word  -  English  word  subsets  As  a  result  we
obtain  8  new  groups  of  sets  of  three  elements  Catalan
word - English word - synset where the  English  word is
the  same  in  every  two  joined  subsets  Bentez  et  al  b
19987
Up to here we have explained the application of
monosemic  and  polysemic  criteria  of  the  class  methods
We  have  also  used  the  variant  criterion  an  hybrid
criterion from the class methods which consists in linking
Catalan words to synsets The link is established when the
synset contains a set of English words and two or more of
these  English  words  have  as  a  translation  the  same
Catalan word
Figure 5 Variant criterion
From  each  of  those  obtained  9  sets  a  representative
random sample has been extracted and validated by hand
in  order 
to  calculate  every  confidence  score  The
reliability  obtained  from  the  sample  is  assigned  to  the
whole set We have validated  1515 out of  49069 Catalan
word - English word - synset links in this thorough way
                                                          
7 In this paper we can see the practical application of the class
methods explained in the paper Combining Multiple Methods for
the Automatic Construction of Multilingual WordNets Atserias
et al 1997 as well as an implementation with Unix tools
The  subsets  with  a  confidence  score  over  85  
have been added to the noun concepts in order to increase
the Catalan WordNet
Criteria
variant
synsets
Table 1 Results of class methods
At the present the  represented  noun  synsets  are
7509 which means 6961 noun forms and 10705 links
22 Verbal Concepts
The  methodology  employed  in  representing  the
verbal concepts has been slightly different from the one in
the  noun  concepts  Bearing 
the  accented
polysemy  we  can  find  in  the  verbs  and  considering  the
lower  number  of  verbs  too  a  complete  manual  building
was chosen
in  mind 
On one side and thanks to the Pirpides8 project
where some of the members of our team took part a list
of English verbs was available being these ones classified
semantically  as  in  the  proposal  of  Beth  Levin9  Levin
1993  with  their  translations  into  Spanish  and  Catalan
On  the  other  side  the  professor  Bonnie  Dorr  at  the
Maryland  University  kindly  provided  us  with 
correspondence English verb - Levin class -  synset Dorr
et al 1997 From these two lists the link Catalan verb -
synset  was  generated  automatically  before  we  validated
every link carefully
The  total  amount  of  verbal  concepts  is  3244
which  means  a  whole  of  3359  verbal  forms  and  9121
3 Software
The  Catalan  WordNet  is  being  modifying  and
updating constantly What is more all these changes have
to  be  done  by  any  of  the  members  of  our  group  at  the
same time This is why we need a database which assures
the  integrity  of  the  information  contained  and  this
simultaneous access in short its consistency To make the
user  work  easier  a  friendly  interface  has  been  created
Firstly this one allows the user to search and manipulate
the data easily and effectively The user also can consult
multilingual  data  and  have  an  intuitive  view  of  the
hierarchy  of  the  synsets  Secondly  some  lexical  data
                                                          
8  Pirpides  is  a  project  in  which  the  Universitat  de  Barcelona
Universitat  Autnoma de  Barcelona  Universitat  de  Lleida  and
Universidad de San Sebastin take part Its main aim is to create
lexical corpora for natural language processing and dictionaries
of use
9 The verbal classification proposed by Beth Levin is based on
the  hypothesis  which  states  that  the  syntactic  behaviour  is
determined  by  the  meaning  of  a  verb  therefore  it  is  useful  to
study the diathesis alternations to classify verbs semantically
mainly  monolingual  and  bilingual  dictionaries  are
available
31Database
To minimize the developing expenses and to let
the free access to the data a freeware database the  Mini
SQL  de  Hughes  Technologies10  Mini  SQL  was  used
This  one  can  be  installed  in  any  Unix  system  including
Linux and offers Application Program Interfaces  APIs
for the main computing languages
The  main  objectives  in  the  relational  database
design  are  the  storage  of  the  general  information  of  the
different WordNets as well as to keep all this information
in a well defined structure Bentez et al c 1998 At the
moment  our  design  includes  the  complete  loading  of
WordNet 15 which means the following
a The synsets and their related information the gloss
the  semantic  field  and  the  total  amount  of  direct
and indirect hyponyms
b  the  different  meanings  of  every  word  and  its
connection to the synset and
c  the  semantic  relations  stored  as  connections  for
synsets 
  hyperonymy  hyponymy  antonymy
meronymy  holonymy  attribute  cause  and
entailment
But for the rest of WordNets we kept
a the meanings of every word with its connection  to
the  synset  in  WordNet  15  besides  the  reliability
obtained through the methods explained in section
b the gloss related to the synset
Right now the semantic relations in WordNet 15
form the skeleton of the hierarchy of all the WordNets in
the system The multilingual connection of the meanings
of the words is also done through the synsets The present
loaded  WordNets  are  fragments  of  the  Spanish  Basque
and Catalan ones
Integrating new WordNets in new languages can
be easily done and the structure of the database allows to
develop  exporting  software  easily  too  Actually  a
prototype  for  exporting  monolingual  Wordnets  capable
for the tools11 in EuroWordNet Novell 1996-1998  has
already been implemented
32 The Interface
In  order  to  build  the  Catalan  WordNet  or  any
other monolingual WordNet it is necessary the creation of
an accessing interface to the database and to the different
available lexical resources  Due to the  physical  distance
between  the different members of the project who handle
the  data  and  to  allow  any  user  to  consult  it  openly  the
interface  has  been  developed  to  work  through  the  Web
Bentez et al cd 1998
The  operations  the  interface  offers  are  the
following
  Consult  Multilingual  WordNet  Its  main  goal  is  to
aid  the  checking  of  errors  and  gaps  in  the  hierarchic
arrangement of the different WordNets To make this
possible  the  interface  shows  the  path  through  the
semantic  hierarchy  of  one  of  the  WordNets  for  any

semantic relation having as a starting point a synset a
sense or a word of one of the available languages
  Edit  Multilingual  WordNet  Obviously  its  basic
target is the edition of the words and glosses of all of
the WordNets except for those of  WordNet 15 For
every verb it is also possible to edit its corresponding
Levin semantic classes see section 22
  Consult  Lexical  Resources  It  allows  to  consult  the
different bilingual and  monolingual  dictionaries  This
information  is  not  storaged  in  the  database  but  into
text  files  At  the  moment  these  lexical  resources
availables for Catalan are the Diccionari general de la
llengua  catalana  Fabra  1984  and  the  Diccionari
bsic  catal-angls  angls-catal  de  lEnciclopdia
Catalana DEC 1996
  Edit  Statistics  This  option  shows  an  historic  list  of
the changes and updates done through the interface
automatic  and  complementary  techniques  for  linking
Catalan words collected from bilingual MRDs for nouns
and lexicons for verbs to English WordNet synsets  As
the Catalan WordNet produced in this way is neither error
free  nor  complete  we  implemented  a  Web  interface
allowing  manual  interaction  that  is  consulting  and
editing with the multilingual WordNet Currently due to
the  smaller  coverage    we  achieved  by  mapping  the
CatalanEnglish bilingual  MRD  compared  to  the  size  of
WordNet15 we are planning to join Catalan taxonomies
acquired automatically from a monolingual MRD Rigau
et  al  1997  The  results  show  that  the  construction  of
multilingual  LKBs  can  be  performed  quickly  using  a
mixed methodology That is building a multilingual LKB
derived  from  bilingual  MRDs  by  using  automatic
procedures  and  then  performing  in  a  second  stage  a
manual refinement of the acquired data
