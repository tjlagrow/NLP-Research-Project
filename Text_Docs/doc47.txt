Abstract To understand galaxies and their evolution it is necessary to describe
how the dierent scales interact how the microscopic physics such as star formation
or the large scale physics such as galaxy interactions may modify the galaxy global
shapes The purpose of this review is to point out some general or recent topics
related to such scale interactions both observational and theoretical which are
relevant in the present understanding of galaxies
Keywords galaxies  N-body simulations  statistical mechanics  ISM 
galactic dynamics
1 Introduction
The purpose of this talk is to review the general mechanisms acting
between the scales in gravitating systems such as galaxies and that
lead to evolution The Universe is certainly hierarchically organized
and at dierent scales dierent phenomena interact with the adjacent
scales For the sake of simplicity it has been customary for a long time to
consider one scale at a time and to neglect scale interactions Scientists
have been inclined to discard scale interactions already because distinct
disciplines are specialized according to the astrophysical object sizes
As a consequence some attempts to introduce scale interactions such
as galaxy mergers met much resistance
But nowadays it becomes clearer that as stars are built upon nuclear
and atomic physics galaxies are also built upon the ISM physics and
star formation processes Conversely galaxy clusters and large scale
structures do matter for understanding galaxy evolution which in turn
cannot be ignored when trying to explain star formation while stel-
lar evolution do certainly plays a role in the chemical composition of
matter Despite a disparity of phenomena we see common phenomena
through the scales because some of the involved physics is scale-free
namely gravitational dynamics
Statistical physics provides an example how adjacent scales may be
sometimes absorbed by a proper theoretical frame The small scale
physics is absorbed by statistical concepts such as the molecular
chaos while the large scale physics is absorbed by proper boundary
conditions such as the extensivity of the system Thus one can obtain

a useful description of gases without including the detailed knowledge
of molecules which are actually quite complex objects Without any
particle computer simulations statistical physics can describe the fate
of a gas enclosed in a box the shape of which is unimportant
However if the box size increases too much we know well that a
suciently large volume of gas becomes self-gravitating and then the
usual tools of statistical mechanics do not work well with gravitat-
ing systems We briey review on the reasons in Sect 2 In Sect 3
we discuss the small scale interactions in galaxies ie the ISM and
star formation physics for which very interesting developments have
occurred in the recent years In Sect 4 some rarely discussed issues
about the large scale interactions of galaxies are presented Finally we
conclude in Sect 5
2 Statistical mechanics of gravitating systems
The fundamental problem of adapting statistical mechanics to gravitat-
ing systems and other non-extensive systems remains to be worked out
In fact statistical mechanics is deeply designed for extensive systems
because rst these systems are very common in terrestrial conditions
and second the extensivity that certain macroscopic quantities such
as energy and entropy scale linearly with the volume allows drastic
simplications of the system description It is therefore paradoxical
that concepts like temperature or pressure are constantly used in
astronomy but these concepts have been designed during the XIXth
century especially for extensive systems in which self-gravitation is
negligible
This issue is important because self-gravity is ubiquitous in astro-
physical systems With proper statistical mechanics tools we should
be able to understand on a deeper theoretical basis the stellar and
galactic systems and also the behaviour of N-body simulations After
all classical statistical mechanics allows to describe particle systems
such as gases without requiring N-body simulations The mere ne-
cessity of N-body simulations in astrophysics illustrates the practical
non-applicability of classical statistical mechanics to systems with long
range forces
A basic unsettled issue is the meaning and denition of entropy As
long as entropy remains a fuzzy concept a measure alternatively of
the available phase space of disorder or of information little change
to the situation has to be expected However the awareness is growing
that the extensivity requirement must be abandoned in order to handle
gravitating systems as well as small N systems Gross 2002 For both

types of systems the particle interactions play a global role therefore
the system is not extensive
The gravitational perfect gas sphere is perhaps the simplest system
where gravitation is combined with statistical concepts since it already
contains the particular diculties brought by the long range gravita-
tional force It has been worked out by a number of authors eg Ebert
1955 Lynden-Bell  Wood 1968 Chavanis 2002 The most notable
feature is that below a critical temperature the specic capacity or
specic heat of the gas sphere becomes negative Such states forbid-
den by classical statistical mechanics are thermally and dynamically
unstable and are closely related to Jeans unstable states In other non-
gravitational systems such negative specic capacity states are called
phase transitions Lynden-Bell 1999 and are known to develop spon-
taneously long range correlations giant uctuations fractal states
etc For such states the uctuations develop until the small scale and
large scale physics react At intermediate scales new scaling relations
may occur The system at least in a transient phase may develop
scaling relations dierent from the classically assumed extensivity
In other words in negative specic capacity states scale interactions
play a decisive role as well as the boundary conditions The small
scale physics is often the fastest so is the most important to include
faithfully For negative specic capacity states it is necessary to include
a description of the eective microscopic physics contrary to the pos-
itive heat capacity states where the small scale molecular physics is
irrelevant
Such eects have been recently studied by Huber  Pfenniger 2002
via N-body simulations In this study the gas sphere is simulated by
gravitating particles slowly dissipating energy As long as the system
specic capacity is positive the particle system follows well the ana-
lytical theory of Plummer softened particles developed by Follana 
Laliena 2000 but as soon as the specic capacity becomes negative
ie the system is gravitationally unstable strong dierences occur
Fig 1 In such latter states the growth of long range correlations in
phase space fractal states occurs in the particle system which are not
descriptible with the analytical theory but resemble the correlations
of Larson 1981 observed in the cold ISM The specic behaviour and
evolution followed by the N-body system is then strongly dependent on
the adopted small scale physics ie the particular softening properties
All these theoretical issues have important consequences for the way
we understand galaxies and other gravitating systems

down to the particle level one cannot trust the numerical model

model of Follana  Laliena 2000 and the thick dots to a similarly softened N-body
simulation Huber  Pfenniger 2002 while the crosses follow another model with
a small scale repulsive softening Negative specic capacity phases occur when the
slope of these curves is positive so are narrower when the particles have a repulsive

Right The Lagrangian radii of the repulsive softening core system
as simulating faithfully the real natural systems as long as the
microscopic physics included in the model does not match the
relevant microscopic physics in the natural system In particular
negative specic capacity at the particle level is up to now never
included in N-body simulations In the future this aspect should
be taken into considerations since in galaxies and cosmology such
gravitationally unstable states ie with negative specic capacity
occur frequently
As found in Huber  Pfenniger 2002 the bias in todays particle
simulations is that softening acts systematically as keeping the spe-
cic capacity at the particle level at positive values The same bias
occurs in gas simulations where the small scale physics is generally
represented by a perfect gas
2 The important consequence for real galaxies is that the fragment-
ing and clustering phases must depend strongly on the small scale
physics As for stars the general properties of galaxies should be
searched also and perhaps principally in their internal properties
and less in their initial conditions as has been for a long time
exclusively considered The problem is hard because it involves
extremely non-linear and chaotic phenomena such as the star for-
mation process which must be understood rst if we want to model
their impact at the galaxy level

31 The new stellar and galactic dynamics
The microscopic physics of galaxies ie the ISM physics the physics
of star formation the physics associated with stellar evolution is crucial
in order to understand galaxies It is obvious that a mass condensation
that is called galaxy must contain a minimum amount of stars so the
star formation process belongs by denition to the galaxy formation
process For a long time this early epoch of galaxy formation was
thought to be conned to a restricted time period so it was conve-
nient to simplify the description of galaxies as collisionless ensemble of
stars With this model N-body simulations could account for a large
number of galaxy properties and the tendency was to neglect the ISM
and stellar physics Later numerous simulation works did include some
representation of gas dynamics as well as recipes of star formation
But a fundamental aspect perhaps much more important for galac-
tic and stellar dynamics that 2-body relaxation or Liouvilles theorem
the overall mass loss from stars has been considered only very recently
eg Kroupa 2002 Bournaud  Combes 2002 Indeed besides energy
stellar populations do return a substantial fraction  20 of their
mass to the ISM over 5  10 Gyr especially after the red giant phase
As consequence momentum angular momentum and mechanical energy
mixing must also occur between stellar populations and the diuse en-
ergy dissipative hot gas component This is especially true for elliptical
galaxies which were considered for a long time as perfect gasless and
collisionless pure stellar dynamical systems Since the mixing of several
percents of mass due to stellar mass loss means a substantial dissipa-
tion for a mechanical system it turns out that over time-scales longer
than a couple of Gyr galaxies must be viewed as essentially dissipative
structures In comparison to the eect of stellar mass loss the much
longer 2-body relaxation time is completely irrelevant concerning the
eective global relaxation Over time-scales shorter than a few Gyr
still an order of magnitude larger than the galaxy dynamical time the
collisionless description remains however valid
As example of consequence that stellar mass loss may lead to Bour-
naud  Combes 2002 show that several phases of bar destruction and
reformation are possible in N-body simulations including mass loss and
external gas accretion
32 The new ISM physics
From observational constraints molecular clouds appear increasingly as
transient structures with a lifetime reduced by an order of magnitude
pfenniger2tex 2022008 159 p5
Daniel Pfenniger
with respect to earlier estimates stars form essentially over a free-fall
time according to Elmegreen 2000
The more diuse HI also is subject to an deep rediscussion about its
lifetime and origins For a long time HI in the outer galactic disks was
seen as almost primordial or at least a long lived phase but recent ob-
servational works suggest something very dierent The study of M101
by Smith et al 2000 suggests that the HI is a by-product of the FUV
radiation HI is observed in proportion of the exciting UV radiation
which means that a cold molecular susbtrat must exist even in the outer
HI disks Deep photometric observations by Cuillandre et al 2001
of the extreme outer disk of M31 reveal the unambiguous existence of
stars while extinction of stars and background galaxies reveal that dust
exists in the HI Blue clustered stars indicate that stars do form incon-
spicuously even in the extreme outer regions of M31s disk But as far as
we know stars require cold and dense molecular clouds for forming thus
there is little freedom left from the conclusion that molecular hydrogen
does exist even in extreme outer galactic disks Allen 2001 Similar
conclusions were reached from distinct motivations for explaining the
baryonic dark matter in spirals Pfenniger  Combes 1994
33 Internal energetics and global galaxy parameters
Traditionally the global galaxy parameters have been explained as relics
of particular initial conditions The general correlations among galaxies
such as the Hubble sequence and the Tully-Fisher relation have been
sought as relics of correlations existing in the initial conditions
However the virial theorem in the form Etot  Ekinetic shows
immediately that to condense matter with little specic energy from
innity into a bound system one must dissipate the present specic
kinetic energy The dissipative nature of galaxy formation is essential
So a galaxy rotating at Vrot  200 km s1 must have dissipated away
its specic kinetic energy V 2
rot at least about 208 eVnucleon a value
intermediate between typical chemical binding energy of order of eV
and nuclear binding energy of order of MeV In addition the galaxy
mass is made of a fraction of stars each nucleon in a Sun-like star
requires additionally to have dissipated away its present thermal energy
 400 eVnucleon In comparison a black-hole requires about 2  106
times more specic dissipation 05 c2  1 GeVnucleon which means
that the fractional mass of black-holes becomes dominant in the global
energetics when it exceeds  05  106 Already the modest Milky Way
black-hole with 2  3  106 M exceeds this threshold
Internal processes are powerful enough to control or modify the pro-
cess of galaxy formation or transformation provided that the emitted
pfenniger2tex 2022008 159 p6

energy can interact with the galaxy scale At any time what matters
is the exchanged power between the scales The maximum dynamical
power Ldyn that a gravitating system can exchange is given by the ratio
of its energy and dynamical time which takes a particularly simple form
in term of virial velocity V cf Pfenniger 1991
This order of magnitude scaling is resembling the IR Tully-Fisher scal-
ing LIR  V 49
rot  not only in the exponent but also in the zero point
For example if V  200 km s1 then Ldyn  12  1010 L The physical
interpretation of this is that independently of the origin of the Tully-
Fisher relation galaxies deliver in the form of light ie nuclear energy
a power comparable to the power required to mechanically transform
secularly its global structure
Thus the secular impact of radiation over the global galaxy mechani-
cal energy appears important especially because galaxies are nowadays
known to be only semi-transparent The similarity of values and veloc-
ity scaling between luminosities and dynamical power is unlikely a coin-
cidence Via global dynamical reaction bars and spirals in marginally
stable disks spiral galaxies can adjust their size to the internal energy
production related to stellar activity SN explosions WR winds out-
ows radiation HI holes etc The galaxy global parameters are then
not only determined by the initial conditions of formation but much
more by the internal micro-physics ISM and star formation
4 External scale interactions in galaxies
41 The energyangular momentum budget of
interactions
Galaxies frequently interact with the higher scale with gas infall ac-
cretion tidal interactions galaxy collisions or mergers But often the
infall accretion or merger processes are viewed as simple mass addition
processes Consequently the history of galaxy build-up is summarized
by a merger tree which leads to the approximate view that galaxy
formation is a hierarchical addition of masses as a function of time In
fact N-body simulations show that mergers may be fairly complex and
until a quasi steady state of the merger remnant is found much occur
not only regarding the morphological evolution of the primary galaxy
but also because each important event ejects a non negligible fraction of
mass sometimes over 10 escapes to suciently large distances to be

considered as innity ie the ejected mass return time-scale is much
longer than the merger remnant dynamical time
Mass escaping the system means that angular momentum and en-
ergy is also transported with values not necessarily equal to the merger
remnant ones When considering galaxies to rst order they are well
explained by the scale-free Newtonian gravitational physics so the total
mass is irrelevant one can thus normalize with the mass A succession
of merger events correspond then to a complicated walk in the specic
angular momentumenergy parameter space
It is easy to see with a simple dimensional model how angular mo-
mentum constraints the galaxy global parameters The system specic
energy e and the specic angular momentum l read
2 cid16V 2
rot  2cid17 
l  R Vrot 
where the kinetic energy part is decomposed into the ordered bulk
rotational part with the average rotational velocity Vrot and the dis-
ordered kinetic energy velocity dispersion  M is the total mass and
R the virial radius  and  are constants of order of 1 By the virial
theorem the system specic energy is also minus the kinetic energy

Now it is useful to express the previous equations for the latter fragile
but observable quantities R Vrot and  as functions of the robust but
hardly observable quantities M  l and e  0

This simple model captures the essential eects due to interactions
or other perturbations to the systems integral quantities The system
radius decreases if M decreases or e increases ie when energy is
lost but is insensitive to variations of l The rotational velocity Vrot
increases either if energy is lost or if l increases or if M decreases
Finally the velocity dispersion  has a richer behaviour summarized
by Fig 2 with a large forbidden region  decreases ie the system
cools when l is suciently increased Low l large e and large 
correspond to hot slowly rotating systems while large l small e and
small  correspond to disk systems
With this gained insight it is now easy to predict conditions favorable
for interactions or other factors leading not necessarily toward hotter
slower rotating systems as usually expected but toward the opposite

specific angular momentum
Figure 2 Velocity dispersion as function of specic angular momentum and energy
disky systems one factor is to raise the system specic angular momen-
tum and the other is to inject also energy to decrease e So prograde
mergers and internal energy injection by stellar activity both favors a
galaxy toward a disky state
42 HVC accretion and dark matter halo shape
The angular momentum constraint can be used in the scenario that
High Velocity Cloud HVC infall secularly increases the Galaxy mass
by a few M yr1 eg Blitz et al 1999 First the Magellanic Stream
as a source of HI has the wrong angular momentum vector since it is
on almost polar orbit Second since the HVCs appear to contain indi-
vidually an order of magnitude more dark matter as the HI outer disk
does one must conclude that the accreted dark matter is substantial
and contains a similar specic angular momentum as the baryons Con-
sequently the dark mass should be expected to adopt a shape of a fast
rotator outwards aring thick disk which are known to depart sub-
stantially from the spheroidal shape almost exclusively contemplated in
the literature for pressure supported systems Notice that a substantial
rotational support for the dark matter may resolve several current con-
icts about cuspy CDM cores since hollow dark mass distributions
surrounding maximum optical disks are then possible Pfenniger

5 Conclusions
Scale interactions are important in astrophysics because the negative
specic capacity states are ubiquitous These states are unstable and
develop phase-space correlations which trigger the interactions of scales
This poses several deep problems for the current way to perform N-body
simulations but this also indicates that galaxies should not be seen as
isolated system insensitive to their scale boundary conditions At small
scale stellar mass loss is secularly important over several Gyr galaxies
must be seen as dissipative structures Also the stellar energy input is
important enough to compete with dynamics and is sucient to deter-
mine the global spiral parameters At large scales galaxy interactions
lead to a a walk through the mass energy and angular momentum
space since at each interaction a substantial amount of matter may
be recycled through the IGM Also the angular momentum constraint
linked to dark matter rich gas infall indicates that aring disk-like
rotationally supported dark matter distributions should be considered
too not exclusively pressure supported spheroids
