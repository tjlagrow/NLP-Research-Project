Abstract
Apoptosis is a highly regulated cell death mechanism involved in many physiological processes A key
component of extrinsically activated apoptosis is the death receptor Fas which on binding to its cognate
ligand FasL oligomerize to form the death-inducing signaling complex Motivated by recent experimental
data we propose a mathematical model of death ligand-receptor dynamics where FasL acts as a clus-
tering agent for Fas which form locally stable signaling platforms through proximity-induced receptor
interactions Signicantly the model exhibits hysteresis providing an upstream mechanism for bistability
and robustness At low receptor concentrations the bistability is contingent on the trimerism of FasL
Moreover irreversible bistability representing a committed cell death decision emerges at high concen-
trations which may be achieved through receptor pre-association or localization onto membrane lipid
rafts Thus our model provides a novel theory for these observed biological phenomena within the unied
context of bistability Importantly as Fas interactions initiate the extrinsic apoptotic pathway our model
also suggests a mechanism by which cells may function as bistable lifedeath switches independently of
any such dynamics in their downstream components Our results highlight the role of death receptors in
deciding cell fate and add to the signal processing capabilities attributed to receptor clustering
Author Summary
Many prominent diseases most notably cancer arise from an imbalance between the rates of cell growth
and death in the body This is often due to mutations that disrupt a cell death program called apoptosis
Here we focus on the extrinsic pathway of apoptotic activation which is initiated upon detection of an
external death signal encoded by a death ligand by its corresponding death receptor Through the tools
of mathematical analysis we nd that a novel model of death ligand-receptor interactions based on recent
experimental data possesses the capacity for bistability Consequently the model supports threshold-
like switching between unambiguous life and death statesintuitively the dening characteristic of an
eective cell death mechanism We thus highlight the role of death receptors the rst component along
the apoptotic pathway in deciding cell fate Furthermore the model suggests an explanation for various
biologically observed phenomena including the trimeric character of the death ligand and the tendency
for death receptors to colocalize in terms of bistability Our work hence informs the molecular basis
of the apoptotic point-of-no-return and may inuence future drug therapies against cancer and other
diseases
Introduction
Apoptosis is a coordinated cell death program employed by multicellular organisms that plays a central
role in many physiological processes Normal function of apoptosis is critical for development tissue
homeostasis cell termination and immune response and its disruption is associated with pathological
conditions such as developmental defects neurodegenerative disorders autoimmune disorders and tu-
morigenesis 15 Due to its biological signicance much eort has been devoted to uncovering the

pathways governing apoptosis
Indeed recent progress has enabled the proliferation of mathematical
models both mechanistic and integrative eg 614 which together have oered profound insights into
the underlying molecular interactions The current work takes a similarly mathematical approach and
hence inherits from this legacy
There are two main pathways of apoptotic activation the extrinsic receptor-mediated pathway and
the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway both of which are highly regulated 15 16 In this study we focus
on the core machinery of the extrinsic pathway which is initiated upon detection of an extracellular death
signal eg FasL a homotrimeric ligand that binds to its cognate transmembrane death receptor Fas
CD95Apo-1 in a 13 ratio This clusters the intracellular receptor death domains and promotes the
ligation of FADD forming the death-inducing signaling complex DISC 1719 The DISC catalyzes
the activation of initiator caspases eg caspase-8 through death eector domain interactions Initiator
caspases then activate eector caspases eg caspase-3 which ultimately execute cell death by direct
cleavage of cellular targets 2023
Apoptosis is typically viewed as a bistable system with a sharp all-or-none switch between attract-
ing life and death states This bistability is important for conferring robustness 24 Consequently
researchers have used computational models to identify and study potential sources of bistability in
apoptosis including positive caspase feedback 8 inhibition of DISC by cFLIP 7 cooperativity in
apoptosome formation 10 double-negative caspase feedback through XIAP 11 and double-negative
feedback in Bcl-2 protein interactions 25
In this work we propose that bistability may be induced
upstream by the death receptors themselves
The current model of death ligand-receptor dynamics assumes that FasL activates Fas by direct
crosslinking producing a DISC concentration that varies smoothly with the ligand input 26 However
recent structural data 27 suggests a dierent view In particular Fas was found in both closed and
open forms only the latter of which allowed FADD binding and hence transduction of the apoptotic
signal Moreover open Fas were observed to pair-stabilize through stem helix interactions This aords a
mechanism for bistability similar to the Ising model in ferromagnetism 28 where open Fas presumably
disfavored relative to their native closed forms 29 are able to sustain their conformations even after
removal of the initial stimulus promoting receptor opening past a certain critical density of open Fas
This induces hysteresis in the concentration of active signaling receptors and therefore in apoptosis
We studied this proposed mechanism by formulating and analyzing a mathematical model The
essential interpretation is that FasL acts as a clustering platform for Fas which establish contacts with
other Fas through pairwise and higher-order interactions to form units capable of hysteresis Figure 1
At low receptor concentrations the model exhibits bistability provided that the number of receptors that
each ligand can coordinate is at least three This hence gives a theory for the trimeric character of FasL
Furthermore at high concentrations for example through receptor pre-association 3032 or localization
onto lipid rafts 33 irreversible bistability is achieved implementing a permanent cell death decision
Thus our model suggests a primary role for death receptors in deciding cell fate Moreover our results
oer novel functional interpretations of ligand trimerism and receptor pre-association and localization
within the unied context of bistability
Results
Model formulation
Constructing a mathematical model of Fas dynamics is not entirely straightforward as receptors can
form highly oligomeric clusters 27 33 A standard dynamical systems description would therefore
require an exponentially large number of state variables to account for all combinatorial congurations
To circumvent this we considered the problem at the level of individual clusters Each cluster can be
represented by a tuple denoting the numbers of its molecular constituents the cluster association being
Bistability in Apoptosis by Receptor Clustering
implicit so only these molecule numbers need be tracked
In our model a cluster is indexed by a tuple L X Y Z where L represents FasL and X Y  and Z
are three posited forms of Fas denoting closed open and unstable and open and stable ie active and
signaling receptors respectively Within a cluster we assumed a complete interaction graph and dened
the reactions

The rst reaction describes spontaneous receptor opening and closing the second constitutive destabi-
lization of open Fas the third ligand-independent receptor cluster-stabilization and the fourth ligand-
dependent receptor cluster-stabilization Figure 2 The orders of the cluster-stabilization events are
limited by the parameters m and n which capture the eects of receptor density and Fas coordination
by FasL respectively Although only pair-stabilization m  n  2 has been observed experimentally
27 higher-order analogues for example as facilitated by globular interactions are not unreasonable
s and ki
Formally these reactions are to be interpreted as state transitions on the space of cluster tuples
However the reaction notation is suggestive highlighting the contribution of each elementary event which
we modeled using constant reaction rates for simplicity we set uniform rate constants ki
for all
ligand-independent and -dependent cluster-stabilization reactions of molecularity i respectively Then
on making a continuum approximation we reinterpreted the molecule numbers as local concentrations
and applied the law of mass action to produce a dynamical system for each cluster in the concentrations
l x y z of L X Y Z Validity of the model requires that the molecular concentrations are not too low
and that the timescale of receptor conformational change is short compared to that of cluster dissociation
To study the long-term behavior of the model we solved the system at steady state denoted by the
subscript  Introducing the nondimensionalizations

and solving dd  0 with    cid55    a polynomial in  of degree maxm n Clearly
the model is bistable only if maxm n  3 two stable nodes must be separated by an unstable node as
the model is eectively one-dimensional in 
In principle all open receptors
contribute to apoptotic signaling but  is small at least at steady state since o cid28 1 due to the
assumed prevalence of the closed form 29 and so can be neglected
We used  as a measure of the apoptotic activation of a cluster
Bistability and receptor clustering
While n measures the coordination capacity of FasL and hence may be equated with its oligomeric
order eg n  3 in the biological context an appropriate value for m relating to the total receptor
concentration is somewhat more elusive Therefore we began our analysis by performing a simple
receptor density estimate Approximating the cell as a cube of linear dimension  10 m the associated
volume of  1 pL implies the correspondence 1 nM  600 molecules  106 moleculesnm2 on restricting
to the membrane ie by averaging over the surface area of  600 m2 Thus for a conservative receptor
concentration estimate of 100 nM 7 9 12 13 the number of Fas molecules in the neighborhood of each
receptor is only  1 assuming a charateristic size of 100 nm We hence found that receptors may be very
sparsely distributed In this low density mode high-order Fas interactions in the absence of ligand can
be neglected m  2 Therefore in this context bistability is possible only if n  3 and the trimerism
of FasL thus demonstrates the lowest-order complexity required for bistability
From the form of dd  this bistability is reversible as a function of the FasL concentration  since
the governing polynomial for  is of degree only m  2 at   0 This suggests that at the cluster
level the cell death decision can be reversed which may have adverse eects on cellular and genomic
integrity However irreversible bistability at higher receptor densities may also be achieved Researchers
have observed tendencies for death receptors both to pre-associate as dimers or trimers 3032 and to
selectively localize onto membrane lipid rafts 33 The result of either of these processes may be to increase
the local receptor concentration In this high density mode we set m  3 as the preceeding approximation
Bistability in Apoptosis by Receptor Clustering
is no longer valid Irreversible bistability then becomes attainable representing a committed cell death
decision
For the remainder of the study we incorporated both the low and high receptor density regimes into a
single model by setting m  3 using  as a continuous transition parameter Furthermore we set n  3
to correspond to observed biology
Characterization of the steady-state surface
Calculation of the steady-state activation curves showed that the model indeed exhibits bistability Figure
3 for reasonable parameter choices Methods Thus we established the possiblity of a novel bistability
mechanism in extrinsic apoptosis The associated hysteresis enables threshold switching between well-
separated low and high activation states Biologically these dene local signals of life and death which
are integrated at the cell level to compute the overall apoptotic response
As per the previous analysis reversibility of the bistability is dependent on  with irreversibility
emerging for  suciently high This suggests a bivariate parameterization of  producing a multivalued
steady-state surface over  -space Figure 4 The result is a cusp catastrophe an elementary object
of catastrophe theory which studies how small perturbations in certain parameters can lead to large and
sudden changes in the behavior of a nonlinear system 34 A more instructive view of the dependence of
the models qualitative structure on  and  is shown in Figure 5
Sensitivity and robustness analyses
We then focused on the activation and deactivation thresholds  respectively dening the bistable
regime These are the points at which the steady state switches discontinuously from one branch to
the other and are given by the values of  at which the hysteresis curve turns ie at  
0 Figure 6 We performed a sensitivity analysis of  by measuring the eects of perturbing the
model parameters about baseline values Methods For each threshold-parameter pair we computed a
normalized sensitivity  by linear regression
Strong eects of  o and u were observed Figure 7 for the corresponding Fas thresholds 
at    respectively the parameters  o 2
l were emphasized Thus the bistability
thresholds do not appear particularly robust However the data reveal that essentially all parameter
sets sampled were bistable This suggests a weaker form of robustness namely robustness of bistability
which nevertheless supports life and death decisions over a wide operating range
 and 3
To probe this further we sampled parameters with increasing spread D about baseline values and
computed the fraction f of parameter sets that remained bistable Methods The results show that f
has an exponential form Figure 8 Extrapolating to D   the data suggest an asymptotic bistable
fraction of f  04 Hence robustness of bistability remains substantial even under signicant parameter
variation
Cell-level cluster integration
Thus far we have considered only the apoptotic activation of an individual cluster To obtain the more
biologically relevant cell-level activation we must integrate over all clusters In principle this integration
should account for intercluster transport as well as any intrinsic dierences between clusters eg as due
to spatial inhomogeneities Here however we provide as demonstration only a very simple integration
scheme Specically we assumed that clusters are identical apart from their parameter values which
are drawn randomly and independent and that FasL is homogeneous over the cell membrane Then we

can express the normalized cell activation as

i i 
where the subscript i denotes reference to cluster i
A characteristic cell-level hysteresis curve is shown in Figure 9 As is immediately evident such
integration is a smoothing operator averaging over the sharp thresholds of each cluster Thus the
cell-level signal may be graded even though its constituents are not Note however that the lack of a
sudden switch from low to high Fas signaling does not necessarily imply the same at the level of the
caspases which ultimately govern cell death as downstream components may possess switching behaviors

Model discrimination
Finally we sought to outline protocols to experimentally discriminate our model against the prevail-
ing crosslinking model 26 which we considered in a slightly simplied form 35 To be precise the
crosslinking model that we used has the reactions

hereafter called the cluster model we used
In analogy with our proposed model

as a measure of the apoptotic signal
Hyperactive mutants
Clearly the crosslinking model has only one steady state while the cluster model is capable of bistability
This hence provides a ready discrimination criterion Although tracing out the associated hysteresis
curve may be problematic we can nevertheless probe for bistability by using hyperactive mutants eg
the mutation of Ile 313 to Asp in Fas which stabilizes the open conformation and enhances apoptotic
activity 27
Specically we considered an experimental setup in which the concentrations of FasL and Fas both
wildtype and mutant can be controlled and in which the apoptotic signal can be measured eg through
the degree of FADD binding or of caspase activation Hence we can map out the response curves at
various levels of mutant penetrance Denoting mutant Fas by Z we assumed that mutant Fas cannot
close so there is no distinction between the stable and unstable open forms we characterized the mutant
penetrance by the mutant population fraction    where   zs is the nondimensional mutant
Fas concentration and      is the total receptor concentration composed of contributions from
both wildtype  and mutant  forms We assumed no other functional dierences between wildtype
and mutant Fas
Proceeding rst for the crosslinking model at xed  the amount of Fas bound by FasL is determined
only by  Hence we assumed that a fraction    of all receptors is bound Since wildtype and
mutant Fas are functionally identical by assumption the fraction bound for each of the wildtype and
mutant populations is also  by independence of the recruitment process Therefore under the
crosslinking model varying  at xed  yields an invariant response curve for the active wildtype Fas
fraction   
In contrast for the cluster model we expected mutant receptor cluster-interactions to aect the
wildtype response Accordingly the reactions 1c and 1d were amended for interaction with Z by
replacing with

As seen in Figure 10 receptor interactions indeed cause the apoptotic signal to increase with  even
after accounting for the eect of mutants This is because mutants can activate wildtype receptors by
pushing the cluster past its switching threshold Furthermore the convergence to the active cluster state
at high  provides evidence for bistability Thus the variance of the -response curve at various  can
be used for model discrimination
Steady-state invariants
Alternatively if working with mutants should prove dicult we provide also a discrimination test based
on steady-state invariants ie functions that vanish at steady state Clearly for each model   dd
provides a steady-state invariant since   0 necessarily at steady state However the diculty lies
in expressing  solely in terms of variables that are experimentally accessible For example current
technology may not allow the concentrations i to be measured accurately if at all Therefore all such
variables must be eliminated Rate constants were considered parameters and so were not subject to this
We assumed the same experimental setup as above and hence expressed each model invariant in terms
of   and  giving functions of the form    a where a encompasses all model parameters
Methods The task then is to use   with    provided by experiment to assess the t of a
model However the parameters a remain unknown so this assessment cannot proceed directly Instead
we considered the best possible t mina   over all parameters A high value of mina   indicates a poor
best-case t and hence that a model is unlikely to be correct Clearly prior knowledge of a can be used
to guide the invariant to biologically plausible ts
To demonstrate that model discrimination using steady-state invariants is practical we generated
synthetic data from each model calculating the accessible concentrations    for each parameter
set This gives two sets of model-generated data For each data set we computed the best-t invariant
error   mina rms  for each model where rms is the root mean square operator The results suggest
that this test can correctly identify the model from the data Figure 11
The systems that we have presently considered are simple enough that experimentally inaccessible
variables can be eliminated by hand For more complicated systems the tools of computational algebraic
geometry notably Grobner bases may prove useful for such an application see 36
Discussion
In this work we showed through analysis of a mathematical model that receptor clustering can support
bistability and hysteresis in apoptosis through a higher-order analogue of biologically observed Fas pair-
stabilization 27 Hence we add to the signal processing activities in which receptor clustering has been
suggested to participate 3739 This bistability plays an important functional role by enabling robust
threshold switching between life and death states Signicantly our results indicate potential key roles
for ligand trimerism 17 and receptor pre-association 3032 and localization onto membrane lipid rafts
33 Thus we provide novel interpretations for these phenomena within the unied context of bistability
Our model suggests an additional cell death decision supplementing those that have been studied
previously 7 8 10 11 25 Critically the proposed decision is implemented upstream at the very death
receptors that initially detect the death signal encoded by FasL This decision is therefore apical in that it
Bistability in Apoptosis by Receptor Clustering
precedes all others in the system Consequently it operates independently of all intracellular components
and so oers a general mechanism for bistability even in cell lines with for example only feedforward
caspase-activation networks 7 9 13 14 Thus receptor cluster-activation may explain how an eective
apoptotic decision is implemented in such cells Moreover this suggests a novel target for induced cell
termination in the treatment of disease 1
We believe that our model provides an attractive theory for the observed biology Although unlikely
to be correct in mechanistic detail the model may nevertheless reect reality at a qualitative level
The signicance of our work hence lies in its capacity to guide future research We therefore readily
invite experiment which can reveal the true nature of the molecular mechanisms involved Given their
structural and functional homology similar investigations on other members of the tumor necrosis factor
receptor family may also prove fruitful Such work serves to further our understanding of the formation
and mode of action of complex signaling platforms such as the DISC which in this view may be considered
the macromolecular aggregates of active Fas
Methods
Parameter selection
The rationale for the choices m  n  3 is presented in the text here we further defend these by noting
that no new behaviors are introduced with m or n  3 The remaining parameter values were guided by
the following considerations Specically we required o and u cid28 1 due to the assumed stabilities of
the receptor species all other parameters were assumed to be close to O1 Within these constraints
parameters were selected to ensure that  is of the correct order of magnitude 7 9 12 13 The
baseline parameter values used were   1 o  2  103 u  103 2
and 3
s  05 2
s  01 3
Parameter sampling
To analyze the eects of variability in the model parameters parameter values were sampled from a
log-normal distribution characterized by a variation coecient D dened as the ratio of the standard
deviation to the median of the distribution For the sensitivity analysis 500 parameter sets were drawn
at D  025 for the robustness analysis 250 parameter sets were drawn over 0  D  5 and for the
cell-level integration 100 parameter sets were drawn at D  025 All parameters were drawn about
baseline median values
Sensitivity analysis
For each threshold-parameter pair linear regression was performed on the threshold data against the
parameter data each normalized by reference values For parameters the reference is the baseline
median value for thresholds the reference is the threshold computed at baseline parameters The
normalized sensitivity  was dened as the slope of the linear regression
Steady-state invariants
The cluster invariant was derived by considering  at steady state ie with   cid55   and
identifying  cid55  Similarly the crosslinking invariant was derived by considering  at steady state and
identifying  cid55    For the full forms of the invariants see Protocol S1
For the model discrimination computation 100 parameter sets   were drawn from log-normal
distributions with median 02 1 at D  02 05 The active Fas concentration  was calculated for
Bistability in Apoptosis by Receptor Clustering
each parameter set for each model at baseline parameters   01 for the crosslinking model for the
cluster model if bistability was observed one of the stable values of  was chosen at random The
invariant error  was minimized using SLSQP with a lower bound of 103 for all parameters

Bistability in Apoptosis by Receptor Clustering
Figure 1 Cartoon of model interactions The transmembrane death receptor Fas natively adopts
a closed conformation but can open to allow the binding of FADD an adaptor molecule that facilitates
apoptotic signal transduction Open Fas can self-stabilize via stem helix and globular interactions
which is enhanced by receptor clustering through association with the ligand FasL
Figure 2 Schematic of cluster-stabilization reactions Examples of ligand-independent
cluster-stabilization reactions involving unstable Y  and stable Z open receptors of molecularities
two A three B and four C Higher-order reactions follow the same pattern Ligand-dependent
reactions are identical except that FasL L must be added to each reacting state
Figure 3 Steady-state activation curves The steady-state active Fas concentration  shows
bistability and hysteresis as a function of the FasL concentration  stable solid lines unstable dashed
lines At low receptor concentrations  the bistability is reversible but irreversibility emerges for 
suciently high representing a committed cell death decision All parameters set at baseline values
unless otherwise noted

Figure 4 Steady-state activation surface The steady-state surface for the active Fas
concentration  as a function of the FasL and total Fas concentrations  and  respectively is folded
indicating the existence of singularities across which the systems steady-state behavior switches
between monostability and bistability stable blue unstable red All parameters set at baseline values
unless otherwise noted
Figure 5 Steady state diagram Steady state diagram identifying the regions of parameter space
supporting monostability colored or bistability gray as a function of the FasL and total Fas
concentrations  and  respectively The monostable region is colored as a heat map corresponding to
the steady-state active Fas concentration  Irreversible bistability is indicated by the extension of the
bistable region to the axis   0

Figure 6 Bistability thresholds The activation red and deactivation blue thresholds 
characterizing the bistable regime green are dened as the concentrations  of FasL at which the
steady-state active Fas concentration  black switches discontinuously from one branch to the other
stable solid line unstable dashed line
Figure 7 Sensitivity analysis of bistability thresholds The robustness of the bistability
thresholds is investigated by measuring the eects of perturbating the model parameters about baseline
values For each threshold-parameter pair a normalized sensitivity  is computed by linear regression
Top sensitivities for the FasL thresholds  bottom sensitivities for the corresponding Fas thresholds
 at FasL concentrations    respectively

Figure 8 Robustness of bistability The fraction f of parameter sets that exhibit bistability as a
function of the sampling variability D follows the exponential form f  f  1  feDD0 where
f is the asymptotic bistable fraction The tted value of f  04 suggests that this robustness
remains substantial even as D  
Figure 9 Cell-level cluster integration The apoptotic signals of all Fas clusters are integrated to
produce a normalized cell activation 0   cell  1 The resulting hysteresis curve on  cell as a function
of the FasL concentration  is graded due to the heterogeneity of the bistability thresholds  across
the clusters top Despite this variability a strong linear dependence persists between  bottom the
valid region    is shown in green

solid lines unstable dashed lines of the cluster model varies with the mutant population fraction 
reecting receptor interactions absent in the crosslinking model The total receptor concentration is
xed at   1 All parameters set at baseline values unless otherwise noted
Figure 11 Model discrimination using steady-state invariants Steady-state invariants are t
to synthetic data generated from each model For each model-data pair the invariant error  is
minimized over the model parameter space The results suggest that invariant minimization can
correctly identify the model from the data
