ABSTRACT 
The problem of Natural Language Query Formalization NLQF is

1  INTRODUCTION 
Natural  Language  Query  Formalization  NLQF  is  a  formal  and 
systematic  procedure  of  translating  a  user  query  in  natural 
language  into  an  expression  in  a  formal  language  without  losing 
the semantics of the user query The choice of a formal language 
can  range  from  SQL  used  in  conventional  DBMS  to  more 
advanced  SPARQL  for  RDF  graph  based  databases  designed  to 
support  the  Semantic  Web  However  any  translation  process 
involves 
linguistic  analysis  of  NL  queries  and 
constructing a formal semantic interpretation that is equivalent to 
the original query semantics NLQF has a twofold effect First it 
helps  in  proper  identification  of  the  query  intent  also  called 
desire  Secondly  it  formally  defines  the  query  intent  in  relation 
to  other  linguistic  constituents  of  the  query  thereby  providing  a 
platform  for 
information 
retrieval  and  question  answering  1-2  The  biggest  challenge 
involved  in  NLQF  is  to  efficiently  and  accurately  identify  the 
innate  desire  and  to  understand  the  linguistic  nuances  during  a 
translation process A query  may bear the same semantic content 
but may be structurally different For an example the query Who 
is  the  greatest  crime  novel  writer  is  semantically  equivalent  to 
the  query  What  is  the  name  of  the  greatest  author  of  crime 
novel It may also have the same grammatical structure but bear 
different semantics  
logical  reasoning  based  semantic 
NLQF  has  been  a  topic  of  intensive  research  in  the  database 
community Most of the effort was concentrated in translating NL 
queries  into  formal  representations  suitable  for  database  retrieval 
such as SQL 3-4 More recent researches have shown a growing 
interest  in  mining  graph  databases  represented  in  RDF-like 
format As a result several works have been proposed to translate 
NL query into SPARQL-like formalism 5-7 18 However many 
of these works support at the most shallow lexico-syntactic query 
analysis extracting heuristic patterns which are then translated into 
SPARQL like queries Many other approaches are ontology based 
where  an  external  set  of  ontologies  are  required  for  mapping 
query  tokens  to  the  most  probable  formal  concept  mostly 
RDFRDFSOWL  represented  so  as  to  link  together  the  mapped 
tokens into a formal semantic graph structure such as SPARQL 
nRQL 5-6 18 The graph structure is then matched with similar 
graphical 
for  query 
answering However ontology assisted NLQF heavily depends on 
the  correctness  and  completeness  of  the  external  ontologies  and 
may  not  be  very  accurate  if  the  target  information  source  is 
independent  of  the  imported  ontology  set  Moreover  such  RDF 
databases  are  nothing  more  than  very    light-weight  knowledge 
bases with no high-end reasoning support required for knowledge 
discovery Hence if the target corpus is a formal knowledge base 
then SPARQL cannot serve as a suitable formal query language 
representations  of  document  content 
Other  distributional  hypothesis  8  based  purely  statistical 
approaches  has  also  been  proposed  mostly  for  NL  query 
processing which can hardly  fall under NLQF 9-11 One of the 
intrinsic  problems  of  statistical  approaches  is  that  query  goal  or 
desireintention detection is very difficult if linguistic analysis is 
ignored  Also  information  retrieval  largely  depends  on  similarity 
measure  models  that  are  mostly  token  co-occurrence  based  12-
13  Such  co-occurrence  analysis  cannot  guarantee  semantic 
similarity with the query goal 
syntactic 
structure 
In this paper we propose a deep linguistic analysis based semantic 
formalization  framework  for  NL  wh-queries  in  English  DL 
representation  of  queries  provides  the  support  to  perform  formal 
subsumption  based  reasoning  over  DL  based  knowledgebase  for 
knowledge  discovery  We  show  that  such  queries  can  be  neatly 
called  Query 
characterized 
Characterization  Template  QCT  covering  most  possible 
linguistically  valid  query  variations  The  primary  aim  of  QCT  is 
to identify the query desire and the relationship of the desire with 
the  query  input  This  leads  to  the  next  step  of  accurate  query 
formalization  However  such  characterization  is  non-trivial  and 
involves  capturing  positional  nuances  of  query  tokens  correctly 
We  also  show  that  a  Description  Logic  DL  25  sub-language 
exists that has  semantic  equivalency  with that of  wh-queries We 
have  presented  the  salient  rules  for  NL  query  to  DL  query 
translation  The  proposed  methodology  is  independent  of  any 
external ontology assistance The scope of this paper is limited to 
wh- queries of six kinds i what ii which iii who iv when 
v  where  and  vi  non-procedural  how  Our  contribution  in  this

2  RELATED WORKS 
Various  approaches  for  NL  Query  Formalization  can  be  broadly 
classified  into  two  main  categories  i  statistical  learning  based 
analysis and iii lexico-syntactic analysis Table 1 is an overview 
of  various  approaches  for  developing  NLQP  systems  We  have 
categorized  them  on  the  basis  of  various  parameters  which 
differentiate them One of those parameters is query nature which 
can  be  of  two  types  i  restricted  R  NL  and  ii  unrestricted 
UR  NL  Restricted  NL  based  systems  cannot  accept  queries  of 
all  linguistics  forms  and  hence  provide  query  formulation  only 
for NL queries that can be given through some sort of controlled 
vocabulary Ontology aided systems import external ontologies as 
input  for  aiding  NL  queries 
their  respective  formal 
representations  Lexicon  aided  systems  use  lexicons  or  thesauri 
for  enriching  NL  query  vocabulary  which  in  turn  aids  in 
normalized  query  formalization  By  target  corpus  we  mean  the 
resource from which the answer is expected We see that systems 
in  this  respect  can  be  either  NL  document  corpus  based  or 
ontology based  
In 10 author has tried to detect goal ie desire from the users 
NL  query  using  Tree-Augmented  Naive  Bayes  networks  TANs 
for  goal  detection  but  this  work  is  domain  specific  and  semantic 
values  are  compromised  here  In  14  a  conversion  tool  which 
takes  queries  expressed  in  NL  and  an  ontology  as  input  and 
returns  the  appropriate  formal  queries  It  uses  WordNet  to 
disambiguate the words and triple based model for formalization  
The  generated  queries  are  then  sent  to  the  reasoner  for  querying 
the  knowledge  bases  In  this  work  ontology  to  be  queried  is 
required  to  be  chosen  by  user  and  it  doesnt  support  complex 
query  formulation  In  15  an  approach  to  Semantic  Information 
Retrieval  of  semantically  annotated  documents  based  on  NL 
understanding  of  query  has  been  proposed  This  work 
incorporates  an  OWL  query  ontology  for  SPARQL  based 
inference  In  16  a  nested  CG  Conceptual  Graph  language  for 
formal  representations  of  natural  language  queries  has  been 
proposed  In  17  a  formal  semantic  analysis  of  object  queries  
required  for  the  modern  object-oriented  databases  has  been 
proposed  Unlike  other  object  query  languages  a  number  of 
realistic  features  including  object  identity  object  creation  and 
invocation of  methods  that  need  not  terminate  has  been  covered 
A  translation  procedure  from  NL  query  into  a  formal  language 
query such as SPARQL has been described in 18 In this paper a 
user  query  is  translated  into  SPARQL  by  choosing  the  most 
appropriate  query  from  the  prepared  queries  Queries  for  the 
knowledge base and a set of corresponding normalized queries for 
the  problem  has  been  prepared  beforehand  and  users  query  is 
mapped to one of query  which is obtainable from the knowledge 
base  For  relatively  large  knowledge  base  such  WWW  this  may 
not be  scalable  approach  In 19  models  of  DP  services  as  RDF 
views  over  a  mediated  domain  ontology  has  been  proposed 
Each  RDF  view  contains  concepts  and  relations  from  the 
mediated  ontology  to  capture  the  semantic  relationships  between 
input  and  output  parameters  Query  rewriting  algorithms  for 
processing  queries  over  DP  services  and  query  mediator  which 
automatically  transforms  a  users  query  during  the  query 
rewriting stage into a composition of DP services 
START 20 was the first online question-answering system which 
uses  statistical  NLP  techniques  and  lexico-syntactic  pattern 
matching Another system called NLP-Reduce 21 was proposed 
which  is  also  based  on  lexico-syntactic  pattern  matching  In  this 
system query keywords are mapped with synonym enhanced triple 
stores in the target corpus A key feature was that user queries can 
be  phrases  or  complete  queries  and  also  need  not  be 
grammatically  correct  A  domain-independent  system  called 
Querix  was  proposed  in  6  where  full  English  questions  had  to 
be  given  which  were  then  parsed  for  extracting  triple  patterns 
These triples are extracted out of a prior query skeleton which is 
generated based on word categories These triple patterns are then 
mapped onto the target knowledge base for match A guided input 
NL search engine called Ginseng was proposed in 22  
3  PROBLEM OVERVIEW  
The problem of NLQF involves 3 core tasks 
Task  1  To  choose  a  formal  grammar    that  can  generate  the 
dependency structure ex parse tree of the linguistic components 
of a given NL query accurately 
language     that  has  an 
Task  2  To  select  a 
interpretation    such 
to  one 
correspondence  with  the  semantic  interpretation  of  the  formal 
grammar   
formal 
a  one 
exists 
Task  3  To  model  a  representational  equivalence  function 
    that takes in a query Q in     and maps it to an expression   
in    such that maximum semantic preservation is achieved Such 
semantic  preservation  can  be  achieved  through  model-theoretic 
semantic constructions      should be consistent and should not 
generate expressions that are mutually inconsistent 
Task 1 involves syntactic parsing of all valid NL queries This is a 
challenging task since NL queries can be of varied forms with a 
similar syntactic structures but different semantics ex Where is 
the  capital  of  Florida  -  Answer  285N  813W  vs  What  is 
the  capital  of  Florida  -  Answer  Orlando  and  b  similar 
semantics  but  different  syntactic  structures  ex  Where  is  the 
capital  of  Florida  vs  What  is  Orlandos  location  -  Answer 
for  both  285N  813W  In  the  former  case  the  queries  should 
be  characterized  such  that  they  have  their  corresponding  formal 
language  translation  unique  while  in  the  latter  case  both  the 
queries  should  have  the  same  normalized  formal  language 
translation  Moreover  queries  may  not  always  be  simple  ie  no 
clausal  constraint  ex  Who  are  Alexandars  favorite  Greek 
mythological  heroes  but  can  be  complex  ex  Who  are  the 
heroes of Greek mythology who were Alexanders favorite and 
compound  Who  are  the  heroes  of  Greek  mythology  and 
Alexander  Although  structurally  the  queries  are  simple 
complex and compound yet semantically they  are the  equivalent 
Hence  they  should  have  the  same  answer  Achilles  This 
requires  accurate  part-of-speech  tagging  POS  tagger  and  parse 
tree  generation  based  on  which  a  given  NL  query  is  fitted  into  a 
chosen characterization grammar  
Task  2  consists  of  translation  of  the  parsed  queries  into  a  formal 
language  representation  usually  the  model-theoretic  style  Just 
like task 1 formal translation is also not trivial since it involves i 
resolution of several ambiguities and linguistic nuances including 
re-formulation  and  normalization  of  semantically  equivalent  NL 
queries  having  different  structures  ii  computational  query 
resolution  ex  How  far  is  New  York  from  Orlando  iii 
comparativesuperlative query resolution ex What is the highest 
mountain in Asia The scope of this paper is limited to the wh-
queries  of  the  kinds  i  whatwhich  ii  whowhomwhose  iii 
where iv when and v how much  
     in  English  model  a  transformation

4  APPROACH 
41  Characterization Task 1 
Any user query has two primary linguistic components - i desire 
or intent of the query and ii input of the query While the query 
desire  is  essentially  what  an  answer  needs  to  satisfy  the  query 
input  provides  the  satisfiability  constraint  on  the  desire  For  an 
example  in  the  query  What  is  the  capital  of  USA  while  the 
desire is an instance of the entity Capital the input is USA acts as 
a  constraint  imposed  on  the  instance  relating  it  to  USA  and  not 
just any other countryprovince  For task 1 described in section 
31  choosing  a  formal  grammar  theory  serves  as  a  basis  for 
generating  the  parse  tree  of  a  query  Constructing  semantics  by 
applying a particular semantic theory over complicated although 
sophisticated  parse  trees  is  computationally  expensive  We 
observed  that  since  our  chosen  semantic  theory  is  Description 
Logics  DL  where  concepts  are  defined  in  terms  of  roles  and 
their  associations  with  other  concepts  thus  forming  subject-
predicate-object  triples  the  primary  objective  of  query  parsing 
should be to identify the desire which is the subject of the query 
predicate  and  input  which  is  the  object  of  the  query  Hence  a 
full-fledged parse tree is not necessary for the case We developed 
a  pseudo-grammar  structure  called  Query  Characterization 
Template 
intrinsic  desire-input 
dependency  structure  in  all  forms  of  English  factual  queries 
simple  complex  and  compound  This  dependency  generates  a 
unique  QCT  for  each  of  the  three  forms  QCT  is  a  pseudo-
grammar in several senses i the sequence of the lexicons of the 
original query can get changed after the characterization process 
ii  lexicons  can  get  normalized  into  a  standard  form  after 
characterization and iii it does not give a generic set of rules to 
combine  or  split  phrase  structures  but  rather  fits  in  queries  of 
equivalent  grammatical  structure  into  one  fixed  template  We 
hereby define the wh-query and its three forms of as follows 
that  captures 
QCT 
Definition 1 Wh-Query A Wh-Query is a query that contains at 
least one of the following query tokens or their equivalent lexical 
variations  what  which  who  whose  whom  when  where  how 
What  query  can  be  i  definitional  such  as  What  is  a  cat 
expected  answer  class  definition  ii  inclusion  such  as  What 
animals  are  mammals  expected  answer  sub  classes  of 
mammal  iii  instance  retrieval  such  as  What  is  the  capital  of 
USA expected answer a city instance iv class retrieval such 
as  What  is  Taj  Mahal  expected  answer  class  of  instance  Taj 
Mahal  and  v  instance  associated  concept  retrieval  such  as 
What  does  John  drink  in  the  morning  expected  answer  sub 
classes of drink that John has for morning  
Which  query  is  similar  to  What  queries  except  that  such  queries 
cannot be definitional  
Who  query  behaves  sometimes  as  a  Which  query  and  sometimes 
as  a  What  query  with  the  special  underpinning  that  the  expected 
answer is related to either a named animal or a person or person 
grouporganization  
Definition  6  Compound  Query  Wh-Query    A  Compound  Wh-
Query  is  a  wh-query  that  consists  of  conjunctivedisjunctive 
lexicons between one or more simple wh-queries or complex wh-
queries  
When  query  can  be  i  absolute  temporal  such  as  When  is 
Thanksgiving  expected  answer  a  particular  day  of  a  month 
and  ii  relative  temporal  such  as  When  will  John  arrive 
expected answer can be afterbefore some event  
Example  of  compound  wh-query  is  What  are  the  available  car 
models  of  Volkswagen  and  their  respective  prices  In  the 
following  sub-sections  the  QCT  of  each  of  the  three  forms  of 
sentences has been discussed at length  
Where  query  can  be  i  absolute  spatial  such  as  Where  is  the 
leaning tower of Pisa expected answer geographical location 
and  ii  relative  spatial  such  as  Where  is  the  ball  expected 
answer can be onunderbelowat some object  
How  query  can  be  i  procedural  such  as  How  is  a  flan 
madeexpected  answer  recipe  or  step-wise  set  of  actions  ii 
state  based  such  as  How  is  Joe  expected  answer  current 
health status of Joe iii quantitative such as How much does the 
bag cost expected answer price or iv computational such as 
How  far  is  Tampa  from  Miami  expected  answer  computed 
distance We do not consider procedural how in the scope of this 
paper 
Why query is causal in nature such as Why is the grass green 
We also leave out why queries from the scope of this paper  
Definition  2  Simple  Wh-Query  A  Simple  Wh-Query  is  a  wh-
query  that  consists  of  a  single  and  non-clausal  query  desire 
explicit  or  implicit  and  a  single  unconstrained  and  explicit 
query input 
Example simple wh-query is What is the capital of USA In this 
case  the  desire  Capital  is  explicit  single  and unconstrained  by 
any  clausal  phrase  The  input  USA  is  also  explicit  single  and 
unconstrained  by  any  clausal  phrase  It  should  be  noted  that  as 
remarked earlier the input is an implied constraint over the desire 
which is different than clausal constraint Also the desire may be 
implicit  sometimes  For  an  example  in  the  query  What  is  a 
tomb  the  implicit  desire  is  the  definition  of  Tomb  ie 
description of the class Tomb while the unconstrained and single 
input is Tomb  
Definition  3  Complex  Wh-Query  A  Complex  Wh-Query  is  a 
wh-query  that  consists  of  a  single  query  desire  explicit  or 
implicit and multiple explicit query input 
Definition  4  Complex  Non-Clausal  Wh-Query  A  Complex 
Non-Clausal  Wh-Query  is  a  complex  wh-query  that  is  clausal 
constraint  free  on  both  the  query  desire  and  the  multiple  query 
input 
Example  complex  non-clausal  query  is  In  which  country  is  the 
state  capital  of  Missouri  located  In  this  query  the  desire 
Country is unconstrained There are two input State Capital and 
Missouri each of which is also unconstrained  
Definition  5  Complex  Clausal  Wh-Query  A  Complex  Clausal 
Wh-Query  is  a  complex  wh-query  that  consists  of  at  least  one 
clausal constraint on either the query desire or query input or both 
Example complex clausal wh-query is Who was the British Prime 
Minister  who  was  elected  two  times  one  of  which  was  during 
World  War  II  In  this  query  the  single  explicit  desire  is  the 
instance  of  the  class  British  Prime  Minister  having  no  clausal 
constraint  There  are  two  query  input  two  times  and  World  War 
II Also the  first input two times has a  clausal constraint one of 
which was during   
411  QCT of Simple Wh-Query 
A  simple  wh-query  can  be  characterized  according  to  the 
following structure  
                                                         
 where 
   second square bracket indicates optional component 
     Query  desire  classinstance  -  value  restricted  to  NN  NNP 
JJ RB VBG3 
    Query input classinstance - value restricted to NN NNP JJ 
RB VBG 
     Auxiliary relation - includes variations of the set is is kind 
of much might be does 
      Relation that acts as i predicate of D as the subject and I 
as the object or ii action role of I as the actor - value restricted to 
VB PP VB-PP1 
        Quantifier  of  D  or  I  -  values  restricted  to  DT1  The   
indicates that Q can recur before D or I 
        Modifier  of  D  or  I  -  value  restricted  to  set  NN  JJ  RB 
VBG The  indicates that M can recur before D or I 
We can observe that this QCT can cover all the linguistically valid 
180  questions  excluding  quantifiers  and  modifiers  according  to 
the given definition of simple wh-query    is auxiliary role in the 
sense  that  it  cannot  act  as  a  predicate  of  either  the  D  or  the  I 
However      serves  as  a  good  indicator  for  resolving  several 
linguistic  ambiguities  For  an  example  in  a  how  query  if     is 
much or its lexical variations then it is a quantitative query while 
in  a  who  query  if     is  does  or  its  lexical  variations  then  the 
associated  verb  is  an  activity  ie  Gerund  ex  Who  does 
singing - Singing is an activity in this case 
   is a relation that can either be associated with D as the subject 
or I as the subject but not both If    is positioned after D in the 
original  query  then     s  subject  is  D  For  an  example  in  the 
simple query What is the capital of USA the subject of    of 
is D Capital and the object is I USA If    is positioned after I 
in  the  original  query  then  its  subject  is  I  For  an  example  in  the 
query Which country is California located in the subject of    
located  in  is  I  California  and  object  is  D  Country  Table  2 
lists some of the important simple wh-query characterization  
4111  Implicit Desire Identification 
Implicit query desire implies that  D is empty This can happen if 
and only if the following query structures are found

If     does  not  exist  then  D  is  empty  If     does  not  exist  while 
   exists then D is empty For an example in the query What is 
converted into diamond    is identified to be  is by default and 
   is  detected  to  be  is  converted  into  However  there  is  no 
lexicon in between    and    structure 3 Therefore D is empty 
Another  case  in  which  D  always  remains  empty  is  when  the  wh-
query  is  a  where  or  a  when  query  This  also  holds  true  for 
complex  and  compound  queries  For  an  example  in  the  query 
When is the next solar eclipse the query characterization is as 
                                                                 
4112  Explicit Desire Identification 
As  an  extension  to  the  observation  the  previous  section  we  can 
conclude  that  any  lexicon  between     and     is  D  For  an 
example in the simple query What is the capital of USA    is 
identified  to  be  is  and     is  detected  to  be  of  Therefore  D  is 
Capital After D is identified the remaining lexicon is I

       that  may  add  to  the  number  of  input 
structure            
within  each  of  such  structures  A  clausal  lexicon  in  a  complex 
clausal  wh-query  is  always  associated  with  such  a  structure  The 
number  of  clausal  lexicons  is  the  same  as  the  number  of  such 
structures in a given query It should be noted that there must be at 
least two such structures for a query to qualify as complex Also 
clausal  lexicons  in  the  general  case  is  optional  and  hence  the 
QCT also holds true for complex non-clausal wh-query We name 
the following structure as clausal structure CS

42  DL as Formal Query Language Task 2 
In  our  approach  we  choose  the  formal  language     to  be 
Description Logics DL As mentioned earlier we argue that most 
factual  IS-A  sentences  have  expressive  equivalency  in  the  DL 
language                      where 
     Attributive  Language    supports  atomic  concept  definition 
concept intersection full value restriction limited role restriction 
and atomic concept negation 
     Union  supports concept union 
     Existential  supports full role restriction 
     Complement  supports concept negation 
     Role Hierarchy  supports inclusion axioms of roles 
    Nominal  supports concept creation of unrecognized Named 
Entity 
    Role Inversion - supports inverse roles  
  Data Type  supports range concepts to be data type 
The  choice  of  DL  over  other  semantic  theories  has  several 
reasons i DL is equivalent to the guarded    fragment of FOPL 
and hence is decidable 25 ii DL representation is compact and 
variable-free  as  compared  to  representations  such  as  DRS  26 
and LFT 27 making it comparatively easy to parse iii the DL 
sub-language                        is  tractable  since  we 
observed  that  most  IS-A  sentence  interpretation  is  covered  by 
                iv  highly  optimized  semantic  tableau  based 
DL  reasoners  28  are  available  as  compared  to  slower  hyper-
resolution  based  theorem  provers  used  in  DRS  or  LFT  based 
reasoning 
the  W3C 
recommended OWL format for web ontology5 Expressions in DL 
can  represent  two  types  of  queries  i  general  queries  such  as 
What is a synagogue answer is a T-Box definition or inclusion 
axiom  in  the  knowledgebase  and  ii  specific  queries  such  as 
What  is  the  name  of  the  highest  mountain  in  Australia  the 
answer is an A-Box assertion in the knowledgebase  
v  DL  has  direct  mapping  with 
43  DL Formalization Task 3 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section  NL  queries  can  be  of  two 
types  in  the  context  of  DL  i  T-Box  queries  and  ii  A-Box 
queries  T-Box  queries  can  be  i  definitional  ex  What  is  a 
cat ii inclusion ex What animals are mammals and iii 
super  class  retrieval  ex  What  kind  of  animal  is  lion  A-Box 
queries  on  the  other  hand  can  be  i  instance  retrieval  Who 
resides  in  221B  Baker  Street  ii  class  retrieval  ex  Who  is 
Agatha  Christie  and  iii  instance  associated  concept  retrieval 
What  does  John  drink  in  the  morning  Some  queries  are 
ambiguous  and  the  linguistic  reading  may  imply  either  T-Box 
definitional or A-Box instance retrieval ex Who is a student - 
Answer 1 John and Joe are students Answer 2 A student is a 
person who studies in an educational institution We argue that 
correct  and  complete  DL  formalization  of  query  implies  that 
query  processing  and  hence  question-answering  can  be 
formulated as either a T-Box subsumption reasoning or an A-Box 
retrieval reasoning over a knowledgebase We do not include     
ie  concept  negation  in  this  work  since  we  exclude  from  the 
scope of this paper formalization of queries with negative clauses 
such as What is an animal called that cannot lay egg 
431  Base Translation Rules 
As  discussed  in  section  41  we  model  any  wh-query  to  have  two 
components - desire and input We also mentioned that QCT helps 
to  establish  desire-input  dependency  From  a  DL  formalization 
point of view such dependency identification naturally culminates 
to  the  DL  definition  of  the  desire  in  terms  of  the  input  By 
definition we mean the model theoretic semantic interpretation of 
the description of a desire as constrained by the input Given any 
simple wh-query Q having D I R2 the following translation rules 
always holds true 
       
          
Base Rule 11 If    is empty and I is not NNP or quantified then 
Base Rule 12 If    is empty and I is NNP then  
otherwise 
                           
                         
          
            
Base  Rule  21  If  subject  of      is     and      is  not  empty  then 
                   
                                                                 
5  OWL  DL  is  equivalent  to            while  OWL  2  is 
equivalent          
Base  Rule  22  If  subject  of      is     and      is  not  empty  then 
            
Base Rule 31 If subject of    is   and I is NNP then  
        
                                   otherwise 
                     
Base Rule 32 If subject of    is   and I is NNP then

WordNetgetMSP  A  method  developed  to  get  the  most  specific 
parent class from WordNet v 21  
Base rule 11 is meant for T-Box queries in general except when 
the  input  is  quantified  ex  Who  is  the  student  Strongly 
   is  an  inclusiondefinitional  T-Box  query 
formalized  desire    
and requires more specific answers ie sub-classes of I Weakly 
  is an generic T-Box query and can allow 
formalized desire   
less specific answers ie super-classes of I is allowed  
Base rules 21 and 22 are meant for A-Box queries At an A-Box 
level the query formalism for rules 21 and 22 is          where 
x  is  the  variable  that belongs  to  the  class     Rules  31  and 32 
are  meant  for  class  retrieval  queries  and  instance  associated 
concept retrieval Also rule 12 is class retrieval as well  
All  the  above  base  rules  can  be  extended  automatically  for 
complex and compound queries as well The core extension rules 
are discussed in the next section 
432  Extension Translation Rules 
In  this  paper  we  discuss  extension  rules  i  effect  of  modifiers 
ii  effect  of  clausal  phrases  and  iii  effect  of  conjunctive  and 
disjunctive phrases 
4321  Effect of Modifier 
Normally  if  a  modifier  in  wh-query  is  a  JJ  or  an  NN  then  it 
modifies  either an NN or an NNP For an example in the query 
Who are the tall students the JJ Tall modifies the input concept 
Student which is an NN In such general cases it is evident that the 
concept  TallStudent  is  a  sub  concept  of  the  concept  Student  An 
interesting  phenomenon  that  can  be  observed  for  desireinput 
modification is what we term as recursive nested modification In 
sentences  where  the  subject  modification  is  by  a  sequence  of 
modifiers  such  as                     then  a  nested  structure  is 
assumed as                         Here   denotes scope of 
the  modifier  Therefore  the  scope  of  the  inner  most  nested 
modifier M3 is the concept D The scope of the modifier M2 is the 
sub-concept  M3D  formed  as  a  result  of  the  M3  modifying  D  At 
the  same  time  M2  also  recursively  modifies  D  to  form  the  sub-
concept M2D Similarly M1 has the sub-concept M2M3D as scope 
of  modification  while  in  recursion  modifies  M3D  and  D  The  T-
Box rule for such recursive nested modification is as follows 
Extension Rule Recursive Nested Modification 3-level nesting 
                                  
4322  Effect of Clausal Phrases 
Complex wh-queries can be formalized by extending the base rule 
and extended rules of simple wh-queries While formalization it is 
important  to  identify  that  whether  the  clausal  constraints  is 
applied to desire or inputs If it is an input constraint then which 
of the multiple inputs it is applied This leads to a very important 
issue  called  query  dependency  problem  Query  dependencies  can 
be broadly classified as 
Desire Dependency In some clausal complex wh-query constraint 
is applied on the desire For example in the query Which atomic 
bomb  was  dropped  in  Japan  which  had  caused  million  people to 
die the desire is name or type of atomic bomb with constraint 
the bomb caused million people to die and was dropped in Japan 
If  clausal  phrase  contains  an  attribute  of  the  desire  then  we 
assume  it  is  constraint  on  desire  The  given  example  query  is 
characterized as 
                                                   
                                               
                                                   
Here  type  of  atomic  bomb  is  desire  and  clausal  constraint  ie 
atomic  bomb  causing  millions  people 
to  die  Therefore 
constraint  is  considered  to  be  applied  on  desire  not  on  input 
Attributes are associated with relations of lexical variations of the 
structure  DESIRE  which  has 
includes 
DESIRE which is a 
DESIRE  which 
Input  Dependency  If  clausal  phrase  contains  an  attribute  of  the 
input then we assume it is constraint on input For example in the 
query What is the price of SLR camera which has 32 megapixel 
resolution is characterized as 
                                                           
                                             
                             
Here  32  megapixel  resolution  is  a  constraint  input  which  is 
attribute  of  input  SLR  camera  Attributes  are  associated  with 
relations of lexical variations of the structure INPUT which has 
INPUT  which  includes  INPUT  which  is  a  In  this  section 
generic  DL  transformation  rule  for  all  complex  wh-queries  are 
given  All  constraints  can  be  formulated  as  intersection  of 
conceptsinstance given in the query  
Extension Rule 1 Complex Query Inclusion T-Box 
        
An example query that requires this rule for translation is What 
the  kinds  of  animals  which  are  vegetarians  The 
corresponding equivalent DL is                               
Extension Rule 2 Complex Query Input Dependency 
                                               
Extension Rule 31 Complex Query Desire Dependency 
                                   
An  interesting  observation  that  we  make  is  that  if     is  empty 
while D is non empty and constrained then   s subject is D For 
an  example  in  the  query  What  country  which  is  in  Europe  has 
the  largest  population      has  has  subject  D  country  since 
   is empty In this case the extension rule is as follows 
Extension Rule 32 Complex Query Empty    
                           
                                           
4323  Effect of ConjunctiveDisjunctive Phrases 
To formalize the compound wh-queries after the characterization 
process it is important to identify whether conjunctivedisjunctive 
phrase  is  applied  on  desire  input  or  relation  Compound  queries 
can  sometimes  be  split  into  simple  queries  andor  complex 
queries  They  can  then  be  formalized  using  simple  query  and 
complex  query  translation  rules  We  have  defined  the  rules  for 
cases when a given compound query            can be split into 
conjunction  of  simple  wh-queriesWe  have  also  done  exhastive 
analysis of  all possible structure of compound query  structure by 
applying conjunctivedisjunctive lexicons between inputs desires  
relation We concluded on 14 different forms of compound query  
The  main  motivation  to  break  the  compound  query  into  simple 
query  is  to  increase  the  precision  and  recall  of  the  knowledge 
discovery  system  If  we  can  break  the    compound  query  into 
separated simple queries then later on all separated queries can be 
fired  in  parallel  and  answer  of  all  separated  queires  can  be 
returned by applying union operation between them We have also 
defined  the  cases  where  splitting  is  not  possible  and  separate 
formalization  rules  have  been  defined  for  them  More  details  on 
this topic is beyond the scope of this paper due to lack of space 
433  Non-Trivial Translation Rules 
There  are  some  queries  whose  semantic  interpretation  cannot  be 
completely and correctly constructed in a straightforward way by 
applying  a  formal  semantic  theory  This  is  because  of  certain 
innate  linguistic  nuances  that  these  queries  carry  that  demand 
additional modification in the formal semantic representations In 
the following sub sections we look into a few of such cases 
4331  Problem of Empty Input 
In  some  queries  the  input  can  be  empty  For  an  example  in  the 
query  Who  barks      is  a  non-transitive  verb  with  no  explicit 
input  as  object  In  such  situation  we  need  to  do  a  reification  of 
   into  its  corresponding  gerund  sense  and  normalize  the  given 
NL query to the form             
              where fr is 
the reification function In the given example we can reformulate 
the query as Who does barking and the corresponding DL rule 
Extension Rule Empty Input                    
4332  Problem of Desire Inclusion 
Some  inclusion  queries  may  have  desire  that  have  may  have  an 
intersection  with  input For  an  example  in  the query  What  kind 
of a water vehicle is also an air vehicle In such cases the base 
rule 11 is modified as 
Extension Rule Desire Inclusion               
4333  Problem of Quantitative how-Query 
In  how  queries  that  are  quantitative  in  nature  ie  R1    much 
many etc we need to introduce a primitive concept Count and a 
primitive  role  hasCount  where  for  any  arbitrary  satisfiable 
concept      the  following  axiom  holds                        
The hasCount is mapped to a function called fcount that calculates 
the  size  of  the  instances  of      at  any  given  point  of  time  For  an 
example in the query How many people live in New York the 
count  operator  works  on  the  desire  people  living  in  New  York 
The corresponding rule is 
Extension Rule Quantitative how 
4334  Problem of Temporal Adverbial Modifier 
Some queries have temporal adverbial tokens such as in the query 
What can be sometimes observed in the morning sky where R2 
observed  in  is  associated  with  a  temporal  adverbial  modifier 
sometimes  The  problem  with  formalizing  such  queries  is  that 
the  ontological  validity  of  the  desire  is  essentially  temporal  in 
nature In other words for the given example if a particular planet 
is  observed  in  the  morning  sky  it  is  not  so  that  it  will  always  be 
observed  like  the  sun  which  we  can  observe  every  day  Hence 
sun  cannot  be  a  candidate  answer  in  this  case  The  rule  for  such 
queries is as follows 
Extension Rule Temporal Adverbial sometimes 
                        
                                    
                                                  
4335  Problem of Superlative Modifier 
In some queries superlative tokens are included such as in What 
is  the  tallest  mountain  in  Europe  In  such  queries  the  desire  is 
for a specific instance that has the optimal maximal or minimal 
degree of measurable modifier of the desire class In the example 
tall  is  a  measurable  modifier  whose  superlative  form  is  maximal 
height  of  all  instances  of  the  desire  class  Mountain  The  height 
attribute  of  mountain  is  implicit  in  the  given  query  Keywords 
such as most and least are good indicators of deciding whether the 
computation  has  to  be  maximal  or  minimal  However  for  suffix 
based superlative tokens ie est it is not so evident The problem 
is how to know that tallest has to maximized while lowest has 
to be minimized We take a bootstrapping based approach with a 
seed  bag  of  measurable  modifiers  such  as  tall  long  big  low 
high  large  wide  etc  and  then  mapped  the  bootstrapped

Our  evaluation  aim  was  to  observe  the  accuracy  of  the  proposed 
QCT  We  leave  the  accuracy  evaluation  of  the  DL  formalization 
as a future work since that requires indirect comparative testing in 
terms  of  mean  average  precision  and  recall  on  some  of  the 
cutting-edge  knowledge  discovery  systems  However  it  is  to  be 
understood 
intrinsically dependent on the accuracy of QCT

the  accuracy  of 
To  evaluate  QCT  we  decided  on  a  simple  Characterization 
Coverage  CC  measure  The  measure  is  modeled  to  understand 
how  many  different  linguistic  forms  of  simple  complex  and 
compound  wh-queries  in  English  can  be  identified  correctly  by 
QCT We measure CC in three perspectives i CC-Precision ii 
CC-Recall and iii CC-F1 score We define them as follows 
CC-Precision Given a test set of NL queries the CC-Precision is 
calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly identified queries 
NCI and the total number of identified queries in the test set NI  
CC-Recall  Given  a  test  set  of  NL  queries  the  CC-Recall  is 
calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly identified queries 
NCI and the total number of queries in the test set N  
CC-F1  The  Simple  Harmonic  Mean  of  CC-Precision  and  CC-
Recall is the CC-F1  
52 Experimental Results 
To  evaluate  CC  of  proposed  work  we  have  used  the  Microsoft 
Encarta  98  query  test  set  29  and  OWL-S  TC  dataset  The 
Microsoft  Question  Answering  Corpus  MSQA  which  is  aimed 
at querying documents belonging to the Encarta-98 encyclopedia 
The  test  set  contains  1365  usable  English  wh-queries  We 
excluded the queries of procedural how and why from this dataset 
We  have  categorized  simple  complex  and  compound  queries 
from  the  dataset  There  are  total  473  queries  of  procedural  how 
and why which are excluded The reduced dataset consist of total 
982 queries which is distributed among 676 simple 147 complex 
and  69  compound  wh-queries  The  accuracy  statistics  is  given  in 
table 5 We observe that the CC-Precision is 100 for all types of 
wh-queries  while  the  overall  CC-Recall  is  9450  The  perfect 
precision shows that the QCT is theoretically sound 
To  validate  our  results  with  Encarta  98  dataset  we  also  tested 
QCT  on  custom  query  dataset  built  on  top  of  OWL-S  TC  v40 
dataset6  The  OWL-S  TC  dataset  consists  of  service  descriptions 
of  1083  web  services  from  9  different  domains  A  service 
description  is  a  formal  specification  of  the  behavior  of  a  web 
service  in  terms  of  its  required  input  parameters  given  output 
parameters  and  other  binding  parametric  details  for  runtime 
execution  The  description  also  contains  a  short  NL  narrative  of 
the  overall  behavior  A  query  dataset  for  this  corpus  was 
developed by three research assistants The task for each of these 
three  assistants  was  to  formulate  a  wh-query  for  every  service 
such that the query desire matches the given output of the service 
and  query  input  matches  the  required  input  of  the  service  Since 
this  task  was  done  independently  we  observed  that  almost  in  all 
cases the syntactic structuring of the query for a given service by 
each  assistant  was  different  The  queries  were  simple  complex 
and compound with an average of 90 query of the form complex 
and compound Ideally the extracted query desire by QCT should 
be  semantically  equivalent 
corresponding web service specification Based on this notion we 
have  calculated  CC-precision  CC-recall  and  CC-F1  measure  for 
each  of  the  three  query  datasets  From  table  6  we  observed  that 
the  average  recall  was  9877  average  precision  100  and 
average  F1  was  9892  The  results  clearly  validate  the  earlier 
results with Microsoft Encarta 98

1  INTRODUCTION 
Natural  Language  Query  Formalization  NLQF  is  a  formal  and 
systematic  procedure  of  translating  a  user  query  in  natural 
language  into  an  expression  in  a  formal  language  without  losing 
the semantics of the user query The choice of a formal language 
can  range  from  SQL  used  in  conventional  DBMS  to  more 
advanced  SPARQL  for  RDF  graph  based  databases  designed  to 
support  the  Semantic  Web  However  any  translation  process 
involves 
linguistic  analysis  of  NL  queries  and 
constructing a formal semantic interpretation that is equivalent to 
the original query semantics NLQF has a twofold effect First it 
helps  in  proper  identification  of  the  query  intent  also  called 
desire  Secondly  it  formally  defines  the  query  intent  in  relation 
to  other  linguistic  constituents  of  the  query  thereby  providing  a 
platform  for 
information 
retrieval  and  question  answering  1-2  The  biggest  challenge 
involved  in  NLQF  is  to  efficiently  and  accurately  identify  the 
innate  desire  and  to  understand  the  linguistic  nuances  during  a 
translation process A query  may bear the same semantic content 
but may be structurally different For an example the query Who 
is  the  greatest  crime  novel  writer  is  semantically  equivalent  to 
the  query  What  is  the  name  of  the  greatest  author  of  crime 
novel It may also have the same grammatical structure but bear 
different semantics  
logical  reasoning  based  semantic 
NLQF  has  been  a  topic  of  intensive  research  in  the  database 
community Most of the effort was concentrated in translating NL 
queries  into  formal  representations  suitable  for  database  retrieval 
such as SQL 3-4 More recent researches have shown a growing 
interest  in  mining  graph  databases  represented  in  RDF-like 
format As a result several works have been proposed to translate 
NL query into SPARQL-like formalism 5-7 18 However many 
of these works support at the most shallow lexico-syntactic query 
analysis extracting heuristic patterns which are then translated into 
SPARQL like queries Many other approaches are ontology based 
where  an  external  set  of  ontologies  are  required  for  mapping 
query  tokens  to  the  most  probable  formal  concept  mostly 
RDFRDFSOWL  represented  so  as  to  link  together  the  mapped 
tokens into a formal semantic graph structure such as SPARQL 
nRQL 5-6 18 The graph structure is then matched with similar 
graphical 
for  query 
answering However ontology assisted NLQF heavily depends on 
the  correctness  and  completeness  of  the  external  ontologies  and 
may  not  be  very  accurate  if  the  target  information  source  is 
independent  of  the  imported  ontology  set  Moreover  such  RDF 
databases  are  nothing  more  than  very    light-weight  knowledge 
bases with no high-end reasoning support required for knowledge 
discovery Hence if the target corpus is a formal knowledge base 
then SPARQL cannot serve as a suitable formal query language 
representations  of  document  content 
Other  distributional  hypothesis  8  based  purely  statistical 
approaches  has  also  been  proposed  mostly  for  NL  query 
processing which can hardly  fall under NLQF 9-11 One of the 
intrinsic  problems  of  statistical  approaches  is  that  query  goal  or 
desireintention detection is very difficult if linguistic analysis is 
ignored  Also  information  retrieval  largely  depends  on  similarity 
measure  models  that  are  mostly  token  co-occurrence  based  12-
13  Such  co-occurrence  analysis  cannot  guarantee  semantic 
similarity with the query goal 
syntactic 
structure 
In this paper we propose a deep linguistic analysis based semantic 
formalization  framework  for  NL  wh-queries  in  English  DL 
representation  of  queries  provides  the  support  to  perform  formal 
subsumption  based  reasoning  over  DL  based  knowledgebase  for 
knowledge  discovery  We  show  that  such  queries  can  be  neatly 
called  Query 
characterized 
Characterization  Template  QCT  covering  most  possible 
linguistically  valid  query  variations  The  primary  aim  of  QCT  is 
to identify the query desire and the relationship of the desire with 
the  query  input  This  leads  to  the  next  step  of  accurate  query 
formalization  However  such  characterization  is  non-trivial  and 
involves  capturing  positional  nuances  of  query  tokens  correctly 
We  also  show  that  a  Description  Logic  DL  25  sub-language 
exists that has  semantic  equivalency  with that of  wh-queries We 
have  presented  the  salient  rules  for  NL  query  to  DL  query 
translation  The  proposed  methodology  is  independent  of  any 
external ontology assistance The scope of this paper is limited to 
wh- queries of six kinds i what ii which iii who iv when 
v  where  and  vi  non-procedural  how  Our  contribution  in  this

2  RELATED WORKS 
Various  approaches  for  NL  Query  Formalization  can  be  broadly 
classified  into  two  main  categories  i  statistical  learning  based 
analysis and iii lexico-syntactic analysis Table 1 is an overview 
of  various  approaches  for  developing  NLQP  systems  We  have 
categorized  them  on  the  basis  of  various  parameters  which 
differentiate them One of those parameters is query nature which 
can  be  of  two  types  i  restricted  R  NL  and  ii  unrestricted 
UR  NL  Restricted  NL  based  systems  cannot  accept  queries  of 
all  linguistics  forms  and  hence  provide  query  formulation  only 
for NL queries that can be given through some sort of controlled 
vocabulary Ontology aided systems import external ontologies as 
input  for  aiding  NL  queries 
their  respective  formal 
representations  Lexicon  aided  systems  use  lexicons  or  thesauri 
for  enriching  NL  query  vocabulary  which  in  turn  aids  in 
normalized  query  formalization  By  target  corpus  we  mean  the 
resource from which the answer is expected We see that systems 
in  this  respect  can  be  either  NL  document  corpus  based  or 
ontology based  
In 10 author has tried to detect goal ie desire from the users 
NL  query  using  Tree-Augmented  Naive  Bayes  networks  TANs 
for  goal  detection  but  this  work  is  domain  specific  and  semantic 
values  are  compromised  here  In  14  a  conversion  tool  which 
takes  queries  expressed  in  NL  and  an  ontology  as  input  and 
returns  the  appropriate  formal  queries  It  uses  WordNet  to 
disambiguate the words and triple based model for formalization  
The  generated  queries  are  then  sent  to  the  reasoner  for  querying 
the  knowledge  bases  In  this  work  ontology  to  be  queried  is 
required  to  be  chosen  by  user  and  it  doesnt  support  complex 
query  formulation  In  15  an  approach  to  Semantic  Information 
Retrieval  of  semantically  annotated  documents  based  on  NL 
understanding  of  query  has  been  proposed  This  work 
incorporates  an  OWL  query  ontology  for  SPARQL  based 
inference  In  16  a  nested  CG  Conceptual  Graph  language  for 
formal  representations  of  natural  language  queries  has  been 
proposed  In  17  a  formal  semantic  analysis  of  object  queries  
required  for  the  modern  object-oriented  databases  has  been 
proposed  Unlike  other  object  query  languages  a  number  of 
realistic  features  including  object  identity  object  creation  and 
invocation of  methods  that  need  not  terminate  has  been  covered 
A  translation  procedure  from  NL  query  into  a  formal  language 
query such as SPARQL has been described in 18 In this paper a 
user  query  is  translated  into  SPARQL  by  choosing  the  most 
appropriate  query  from  the  prepared  queries  Queries  for  the 
knowledge base and a set of corresponding normalized queries for 
the  problem  has  been  prepared  beforehand  and  users  query  is 
mapped to one of query  which is obtainable from the knowledge 
base  For  relatively  large  knowledge  base  such  WWW  this  may 
not be  scalable  approach  In 19  models  of  DP  services  as  RDF 
views  over  a  mediated  domain  ontology  has  been  proposed 
Each  RDF  view  contains  concepts  and  relations  from  the 
mediated  ontology  to  capture  the  semantic  relationships  between 
input  and  output  parameters  Query  rewriting  algorithms  for 
processing  queries  over  DP  services  and  query  mediator  which 
automatically  transforms  a  users  query  during  the  query 
rewriting stage into a composition of DP services 
START 20 was the first online question-answering system which 
uses  statistical  NLP  techniques  and  lexico-syntactic  pattern 
matching Another system called NLP-Reduce 21 was proposed 
which  is  also  based  on  lexico-syntactic  pattern  matching  In  this 
system query keywords are mapped with synonym enhanced triple 
stores in the target corpus A key feature was that user queries can 
be  phrases  or  complete  queries  and  also  need  not  be 
grammatically  correct  A  domain-independent  system  called 
Querix  was  proposed  in  6  where  full  English  questions  had  to 
be  given  which  were  then  parsed  for  extracting  triple  patterns 
These triples are extracted out of a prior query skeleton which is 
generated based on word categories These triple patterns are then 
mapped onto the target knowledge base for match A guided input 
NL search engine called Ginseng was proposed in 22  
3  PROBLEM OVERVIEW  
The problem of NLQF involves 3 core tasks 
Task  1  To  choose  a  formal  grammar    that  can  generate  the 
dependency structure ex parse tree of the linguistic components 
of a given NL query accurately 
language     that  has  an 
Task  2  To  select  a 
interpretation    such 
to  one 
correspondence  with  the  semantic  interpretation  of  the  formal 
grammar   
formal 
a  one 
exists 
Task  3  To  model  a  representational  equivalence  function 
    that takes in a query Q in     and maps it to an expression   
in    such that maximum semantic preservation is achieved Such 
semantic  preservation  can  be  achieved  through  model-theoretic 
semantic constructions      should be consistent and should not 
generate expressions that are mutually inconsistent 
Task 1 involves syntactic parsing of all valid NL queries This is a 
challenging task since NL queries can be of varied forms with a 
similar syntactic structures but different semantics ex Where is 
the  capital  of  Florida  -  Answer  285N  813W  vs  What  is 
the  capital  of  Florida  -  Answer  Orlando  and  b  similar 
semantics  but  different  syntactic  structures  ex  Where  is  the 
capital  of  Florida  vs  What  is  Orlandos  location  -  Answer 
for  both  285N  813W  In  the  former  case  the  queries  should 
be  characterized  such  that  they  have  their  corresponding  formal 
language  translation  unique  while  in  the  latter  case  both  the 
queries  should  have  the  same  normalized  formal  language 
translation  Moreover  queries  may  not  always  be  simple  ie  no 
clausal  constraint  ex  Who  are  Alexandars  favorite  Greek 
mythological  heroes  but  can  be  complex  ex  Who  are  the 
heroes of Greek mythology who were Alexanders favorite and 
compound  Who  are  the  heroes  of  Greek  mythology  and 
Alexander  Although  structurally  the  queries  are  simple 
complex and compound yet semantically they  are the  equivalent 
Hence  they  should  have  the  same  answer  Achilles  This 
requires  accurate  part-of-speech  tagging  POS  tagger  and  parse 
tree  generation  based  on  which  a  given  NL  query  is  fitted  into  a 
chosen characterization grammar  
Task  2  consists  of  translation  of  the  parsed  queries  into  a  formal 
language  representation  usually  the  model-theoretic  style  Just

4  APPROACH 
41  Characterization Task 1 
Any user query has two primary linguistic components - i desire 
or intent of the query and ii input of the query While the query 
desire  is  essentially  what  an  answer  needs  to  satisfy  the  query 
input  provides  the  satisfiability  constraint  on  the  desire  For  an 
example  in  the  query  What  is  the  capital  of  USA  while  the 
desire is an instance of the entity Capital the input is USA acts as 
a  constraint  imposed  on  the  instance  relating  it  to  USA  and  not 
just any other countryprovince  For task 1 described in section 
31  choosing  a  formal  grammar  theory  serves  as  a  basis  for 
generating  the  parse  tree  of  a  query  Constructing  semantics  by 
applying a particular semantic theory over complicated although 
sophisticated  parse  trees  is  computationally  expensive  We 
observed  that  since  our  chosen  semantic  theory  is  Description 
Logics  DL  where  concepts  are  defined  in  terms  of  roles  and 
their  associations  with  other  concepts  thus  forming  subject-
predicate-object  triples  the  primary  objective  of  query  parsing 
should be to identify the desire which is the subject of the query 
predicate  and  input  which  is  the  object  of  the  query  Hence  a 
full-fledged parse tree is not necessary for the case We developed 
a  pseudo-grammar  structure  called  Query  Characterization 
Template 
intrinsic  desire-input 
dependency  structure  in  all  forms  of  English  factual  queries 
simple  complex  and  compound  This  dependency  generates  a 
unique  QCT  for  each  of  the  three  forms  QCT  is  a  pseudo-
grammar in several senses i the sequence of the lexicons of the 
original query can get changed after the characterization process 
ii  lexicons  can  get  normalized  into  a  standard  form  after 
characterization and iii it does not give a generic set of rules to 
combine  or  split  phrase  structures  but  rather  fits  in  queries  of 
equivalent  grammatical  structure  into  one  fixed  template  We 
hereby define the wh-query and its three forms of as follows 
that  captures 
QCT 
Definition 1 Wh-Query A Wh-Query is a query that contains at 
least one of the following query tokens or their equivalent lexical 
variations  what  which  who  whose  whom  when  where  how 
What  query  can  be  i  definitional  such  as  What  is  a  cat 
expected  answer  class  definition  ii  inclusion  such  as  What 
animals  are  mammals  expected  answer  sub  classes  of 
mammal  iii  instance  retrieval  such  as  What  is  the  capital  of 
USA expected answer a city instance iv class retrieval such 
as  What  is  Taj  Mahal  expected  answer  class  of  instance  Taj 
Mahal  and  v  instance  associated  concept  retrieval  such  as 
What  does  John  drink  in  the  morning  expected  answer  sub 
classes of drink that John has for morning  
Which  query  is  similar  to  What  queries  except  that  such  queries 
cannot be definitional  
Who  query  behaves  sometimes  as  a  Which  query  and  sometimes 
as  a  What  query  with  the  special  underpinning  that  the  expected 
answer is related to either a named animal or a person or person 
grouporganization  
Definition  6  Compound  Query  Wh-Query    A  Compound  Wh-
Query  is  a  wh-query  that  consists  of  conjunctivedisjunctive 
lexicons between one or more simple wh-queries or complex wh-
queries  
When  query  can  be  i  absolute  temporal  such  as  When  is 
Thanksgiving  expected  answer  a  particular  day  of  a  month 
and  ii  relative  temporal  such  as  When  will  John  arrive 
expected answer can be afterbefore some event  
Example  of  compound  wh-query  is  What  are  the  available  car 
models  of  Volkswagen  and  their  respective  prices  In  the 
following  sub-sections  the  QCT  of  each  of  the  three  forms  of 
sentences has been discussed at length  
Where  query  can  be  i  absolute  spatial  such  as  Where  is  the 
leaning tower of Pisa expected answer geographical location 
and  ii  relative  spatial  such  as  Where  is  the  ball  expected 
answer can be onunderbelowat some object  
How  query  can  be  i  procedural  such  as  How  is  a  flan 
madeexpected  answer  recipe  or  step-wise  set  of  actions  ii 
state  based  such  as  How  is  Joe  expected  answer  current 
health status of Joe iii quantitative such as How much does the 
bag cost expected answer price or iv computational such as 
How  far  is  Tampa  from  Miami  expected  answer  computed 
distance We do not consider procedural how in the scope of this 
paper 
Why query is causal in nature such as Why is the grass green 
We also leave out why queries from the scope of this paper  
Definition  2  Simple  Wh-Query  A  Simple  Wh-Query  is  a  wh-
query  that  consists  of  a  single  and  non-clausal  query  desire 
explicit  or  implicit  and  a  single  unconstrained  and  explicit 
query input 
Example simple wh-query is What is the capital of USA In this 
case  the  desire  Capital  is  explicit  single  and unconstrained  by 
any  clausal  phrase  The  input  USA  is  also  explicit  single  and 
unconstrained  by  any  clausal  phrase  It  should  be  noted  that  as 
remarked earlier the input is an implied constraint over the desire 
which is different than clausal constraint Also the desire may be 
implicit  sometimes  For  an  example  in  the  query  What  is  a 
tomb  the  implicit  desire  is  the  definition  of  Tomb  ie 
description of the class Tomb while the unconstrained and single 
input is Tomb  
Definition  3  Complex  Wh-Query  A  Complex  Wh-Query  is  a 
wh-query  that  consists  of  a  single  query  desire  explicit  or 
implicit and multiple explicit query input 
Definition  4  Complex  Non-Clausal  Wh-Query  A  Complex 
Non-Clausal  Wh-Query  is  a  complex  wh-query  that  is  clausal 
constraint  free  on  both  the  query  desire  and  the  multiple  query 
input 
Example  complex  non-clausal  query  is  In  which  country  is  the 
state  capital  of  Missouri  located  In  this  query  the  desire 
Country is unconstrained There are two input State Capital and 
Missouri each of which is also unconstrained  
Definition  5  Complex  Clausal  Wh-Query  A  Complex  Clausal 
Wh-Query  is  a  complex  wh-query  that  consists  of  at  least  one 
clausal constraint on either the query desire or query input or both 
Example complex clausal wh-query is Who was the British Prime 
Minister  who  was  elected  two  times  one  of  which  was  during 
World  War  II  In  this  query  the  single  explicit  desire  is  the 
instance  of  the  class  British  Prime  Minister  having  no  clausal 
constraint  There  are  two  query  input  two  times  and  World  War 
II Also the  first input two times has a  clausal constraint one of 
which was during   
411  QCT of Simple Wh-Query 
A  simple  wh-query  can  be  characterized  according  to  the 
following structure  
                                                         
 where 
   second square bracket indicates optional component 
     Query  desire  classinstance  -  value  restricted  to  NN  NNP 
JJ RB VBG3 
    Query input classinstance - value restricted to NN NNP JJ 
RB VBG 
     Auxiliary relation - includes variations of the set is is kind 
of much might be does 
      Relation that acts as i predicate of D as the subject and I 
as the object or ii action role of I as the actor - value restricted to 
VB PP VB-PP1 
        Quantifier  of  D  or  I  -  values  restricted  to  DT1  The   
indicates that Q can recur before D or I 
        Modifier  of  D  or  I  -  value  restricted  to  set  NN  JJ  RB 
VBG The  indicates that M can recur before D or I 
We can observe that this QCT can cover all the linguistically valid 
180  questions  excluding  quantifiers  and  modifiers  according  to 
the given definition of simple wh-query    is auxiliary role in the 
sense  that  it  cannot  act  as  a  predicate  of  either  the  D  or  the  I 
However      serves  as  a  good  indicator  for  resolving  several 
linguistic  ambiguities  For  an  example  in  a  how  query  if     is 
much or its lexical variations then it is a quantitative query while 
in  a  who  query  if     is  does  or  its  lexical  variations  then  the 
associated  verb  is  an  activity  ie  Gerund  ex  Who  does 
singing - Singing is an activity in this case 
   is a relation that can either be associated with D as the subject 
or I as the subject but not both If    is positioned after D in the 
original  query  then     s  subject  is  D  For  an  example  in  the 
simple query What is the capital of USA the subject of    of 
is D Capital and the object is I USA If    is positioned after I 
in  the  original  query  then  its  subject  is  I  For  an  example  in  the 
query Which country is California located in the subject of    
located  in  is  I  California  and  object  is  D  Country  Table  2 
lists some of the important simple wh-query characterization  
4111  Implicit Desire Identification 
Implicit query desire implies that  D is empty This can happen if 
and only if the following query structures are found

If     does  not  exist  then  D  is  empty  If     does  not  exist  while 
   exists then D is empty For an example in the query What is 
converted into diamond    is identified to be  is by default and 
   is  detected  to  be  is  converted  into  However  there  is  no 
lexicon in between    and    structure 3 Therefore D is empty 
Another  case  in  which  D  always  remains  empty  is  when  the  wh-
query  is  a  where  or  a  when  query  This  also  holds  true  for 
complex  and  compound  queries  For  an  example  in  the  query 
When is the next solar eclipse the query characterization is as 
                                                                 
4112  Explicit Desire Identification 
As  an  extension  to  the  observation  the  previous  section  we  can 
conclude  that  any  lexicon  between     and     is  D  For  an 
example in the simple query What is the capital of USA    is 
identified  to  be  is  and     is  detected  to  be  of  Therefore  D  is 
Capital After D is identified the remaining lexicon is I

4 Modifiers and quantifiers are not associated with  D and I They 
are  associated  in  exactly  the  same  way  as  QCT  of  simple

In  this  QCT  we  see    the  possible  repetition  of  the  structure 
      Within this structure there is an optional sub-
       that  may  add  to  the  number  of  input 
structure            
within  each  of  such  structures  A  clausal  lexicon  in  a  complex 
clausal  wh-query  is  always  associated  with  such  a  structure  The 
number  of  clausal  lexicons  is  the  same  as  the  number  of  such 
structures in a given query It should be noted that there must be at 
least two such structures for a query to qualify as complex Also 
clausal  lexicons  in  the  general  case  is  optional  and  hence  the 
QCT also holds true for complex non-clausal wh-query We name 
the following structure as clausal structure CS

given  QCT  can  cover  1800  linguistically  valid  complex  queries 
excluding quantifiers and modifiers 
413  QCT of Compound Wh-Query 
A compound Wh-query can be characterized according to

42  DL as Formal Query Language Task 2 
In  our  approach  we  choose  the  formal  language     to  be 
Description Logics DL As mentioned earlier we argue that most 
factual  IS-A  sentences  have  expressive  equivalency  in  the  DL 
language                      where 
     Attributive  Language    supports  atomic  concept  definition 
concept intersection full value restriction limited role restriction 
and atomic concept negation 
     Union  supports concept union 
     Existential  supports full role restriction 
     Complement  supports concept negation 
     Role Hierarchy  supports inclusion axioms of roles 
    Nominal  supports concept creation of unrecognized Named 
Entity 
    Role Inversion - supports inverse roles  
  Data Type  supports range concepts to be data type 
The  choice  of  DL  over  other  semantic  theories  has  several 
reasons i DL is equivalent to the guarded    fragment of FOPL 
and hence is decidable 25 ii DL representation is compact and 
variable-free  as  compared  to  representations  such  as  DRS  26 
and LFT 27 making it comparatively easy to parse iii the DL 
sub-language                        is  tractable  since  we 
observed  that  most  IS-A  sentence  interpretation  is  covered  by 
                iv  highly  optimized  semantic  tableau  based 
DL  reasoners  28  are  available  as  compared  to  slower  hyper-
resolution  based  theorem  provers  used  in  DRS  or  LFT  based 
reasoning 
the  W3C 
recommended OWL format for web ontology5 Expressions in DL 
can  represent  two  types  of  queries  i  general  queries  such  as 
What is a synagogue answer is a T-Box definition or inclusion 
axiom  in  the  knowledgebase  and  ii  specific  queries  such  as 
What  is  the  name  of  the  highest  mountain  in  Australia  the 
answer is an A-Box assertion in the knowledgebase  
v  DL  has  direct  mapping  with 
43  DL Formalization Task 3 
As  mentioned  in  the  previous  section  NL  queries  can  be  of  two 
types  in  the  context  of  DL  i  T-Box  queries  and  ii  A-Box 
queries  T-Box  queries  can  be  i  definitional  ex  What  is  a 
cat ii inclusion ex What animals are mammals and iii 
super  class  retrieval  ex  What  kind  of  animal  is  lion  A-Box 
queries  on  the  other  hand  can  be  i  instance  retrieval  Who 
resides  in  221B  Baker  Street  ii  class  retrieval  ex  Who  is 
Agatha  Christie  and  iii  instance  associated  concept  retrieval 
What  does  John  drink  in  the  morning  Some  queries  are 
ambiguous  and  the  linguistic  reading  may  imply  either  T-Box 
definitional or A-Box instance retrieval ex Who is a student - 
Answer 1 John and Joe are students Answer 2 A student is a 
person who studies in an educational institution We argue that 
correct  and  complete  DL  formalization  of  query  implies  that 
query  processing  and  hence  question-answering  can  be 
formulated as either a T-Box subsumption reasoning or an A-Box 
retrieval reasoning over a knowledgebase We do not include     
ie  concept  negation  in  this  work  since  we  exclude  from  the 
scope of this paper formalization of queries with negative clauses 
such as What is an animal called that cannot lay egg 
431  Base Translation Rules 
As  discussed  in  section  41  we  model  any  wh-query  to  have  two 
components - desire and input We also mentioned that QCT helps 
to  establish  desire-input  dependency  From  a  DL  formalization 
point of view such dependency identification naturally culminates 
to  the  DL  definition  of  the  desire  in  terms  of  the  input  By 
definition we mean the model theoretic semantic interpretation of 
the description of a desire as constrained by the input Given any 
simple wh-query Q having D I R2 the following translation rules 
always holds true 
       
          
Base Rule 11 If    is empty and I is not NNP or quantified then 
Base Rule 12 If    is empty and I is NNP then  
otherwise 
                           
                         
          
            
Base  Rule  21  If  subject  of      is     and      is  not  empty  then 
                   
                                                                 
5  OWL  DL  is  equivalent  to            while  OWL  2  is 
equivalent          
Base  Rule  22  If  subject  of      is     and      is  not  empty  then 
            
Base Rule 31 If subject of    is   and I is NNP then  
        
                                   otherwise 
                     
Base Rule 32 If subject of    is   and I is NNP then

  is an generic T-Box query and can allow 
formalized desire   
less specific answers ie super-classes of I is allowed  
Base rules 21 and 22 are meant for A-Box queries At an A-Box 
level the query formalism for rules 21 and 22 is          where 
x  is  the  variable  that belongs  to  the  class     Rules  31  and 32 
are  meant  for  class  retrieval  queries  and  instance  associated 
concept retrieval Also rule 12 is class retrieval as well  
All  the  above  base  rules  can  be  extended  automatically  for 
complex and compound queries as well The core extension rules 
are discussed in the next section 
432  Extension Translation Rules 
In  this  paper  we  discuss  extension  rules  i  effect  of  modifiers 
ii  effect  of  clausal  phrases  and  iii  effect  of  conjunctive  and 
disjunctive phrases 
4321  Effect of Modifier 
Normally  if  a  modifier  in  wh-query  is  a  JJ  or  an  NN  then  it 
modifies  either an NN or an NNP For an example in the query 
Who are the tall students the JJ Tall modifies the input concept 
Student which is an NN In such general cases it is evident that the 
concept  TallStudent  is  a  sub  concept  of  the  concept  Student  An 
interesting  phenomenon  that  can  be  observed  for  desireinput 
modification is what we term as recursive nested modification In 
sentences  where  the  subject  modification  is  by  a  sequence  of 
modifiers  such  as                     then  a  nested  structure  is 
assumed as                         Here   denotes scope of 
the  modifier  Therefore  the  scope  of  the  inner  most  nested 
modifier M3 is the concept D The scope of the modifier M2 is the 
sub-concept  M3D  formed  as  a  result  of  the  M3  modifying  D  At 
the  same  time  M2  also  recursively  modifies  D  to  form  the  sub-
concept M2D Similarly M1 has the sub-concept M2M3D as scope 
of  modification  while  in  recursion  modifies  M3D  and  D  The  T-
Box rule for such recursive nested modification is as follows 
Extension Rule Recursive Nested Modification 3-level nesting 
                                  
4322  Effect of Clausal Phrases 
Complex wh-queries can be formalized by extending the base rule 
and extended rules of simple wh-queries While formalization it is 
important  to  identify  that  whether  the  clausal  constraints  is 
applied to desire or inputs If it is an input constraint then which 
of the multiple inputs it is applied This leads to a very important 
issue  called  query  dependency  problem  Query  dependencies  can 
be broadly classified as 
Desire Dependency In some clausal complex wh-query constraint 
is applied on the desire For example in the query Which atomic 
bomb  was  dropped  in  Japan  which  had  caused  million  people to 
die the desire is name or type of atomic bomb with constraint 
the bomb caused million people to die and was dropped in Japan 
If  clausal  phrase  contains  an  attribute  of  the  desire  then  we 
assume  it  is  constraint  on  desire  The  given  example  query  is 
characterized as 
                                                   
                                               
                                                   
Here  type  of  atomic  bomb  is  desire  and  clausal  constraint  ie 
atomic  bomb  causing  millions  people 
to  die  Therefore 
constraint  is  considered  to  be  applied  on  desire  not  on  input 
Attributes are associated with relations of lexical variations of the 
structure  DESIRE  which  has 
includes 
DESIRE which is a 
DESIRE  which 
Input  Dependency  If  clausal  phrase  contains  an  attribute  of  the 
input then we assume it is constraint on input For example in the 
query What is the price of SLR camera which has 32 megapixel 
resolution is characterized as 
                                                           
                                             
                             
Here  32  megapixel  resolution  is  a  constraint  input  which  is 
attribute  of  input  SLR  camera  Attributes  are  associated  with 
relations of lexical variations of the structure INPUT which has 
INPUT  which  includes  INPUT  which  is  a  In  this  section 
generic  DL  transformation  rule  for  all  complex  wh-queries  are 
given  All  constraints  can  be  formulated  as  intersection  of 
conceptsinstance given in the query  
Extension Rule 1 Complex Query Inclusion T-Box 
        
An example query that requires this rule for translation is What 
the  kinds  of  animals  which  are  vegetarians  The 
corresponding equivalent DL is                               
Extension Rule 2 Complex Query Input Dependency 
                                               
Extension Rule 31 Complex Query Desire Dependency 
                                   
An  interesting  observation  that  we  make  is  that  if     is  empty 
while D is non empty and constrained then   s subject is D For 
an  example  in  the  query  What  country  which  is  in  Europe  has 
the  largest  population      has  has  subject  D  country  since 
   is empty In this case the extension rule is as follows 
Extension Rule 32 Complex Query Empty    
                           
                                           
4323  Effect of ConjunctiveDisjunctive Phrases 
To formalize the compound wh-queries after the characterization 
process it is important to identify whether conjunctivedisjunctive 
phrase  is  applied  on  desire  input  or  relation  Compound  queries 
can  sometimes  be  split  into  simple  queries  andor  complex 
queries  They  can  then  be  formalized  using  simple  query  and 
complex  query  translation  rules  We  have  defined  the  rules  for 
cases when a given compound query            can be split into 
conjunction  of  simple  wh-queriesWe  have  also  done  exhastive 
analysis of  all possible structure of compound query  structure by 
applying conjunctivedisjunctive lexicons between inputs desires  
relation We concluded on 14 different forms of compound query  
The  main  motivation  to  break  the  compound  query  into  simple 
query  is  to  increase  the  precision  and  recall  of  the  knowledge 
discovery  system  If  we  can  break  the    compound  query  into 
separated simple queries then later on all separated queries can be 
fired  in  parallel  and  answer  of  all  separated  queires  can  be 
returned by applying union operation between them We have also 
defined  the  cases  where  splitting  is  not  possible  and  separate 
formalization  rules  have  been  defined  for  them  More  details  on 
this topic is beyond the scope of this paper due to lack of space 
433  Non-Trivial Translation Rules 
There  are  some  queries  whose  semantic  interpretation  cannot  be 
completely and correctly constructed in a straightforward way by 
applying  a  formal  semantic  theory  This  is  because  of  certain 
innate  linguistic  nuances  that  these  queries  carry  that  demand 
additional modification in the formal semantic representations In 
the following sub sections we look into a few of such cases 
4331  Problem of Empty Input 
In  some  queries  the  input  can  be  empty  For  an  example  in  the 
query  Who  barks      is  a  non-transitive  verb  with  no  explicit 
input  as  object  In  such  situation  we  need  to  do  a  reification  of 
   into  its  corresponding  gerund  sense  and  normalize  the  given 
NL query to the form             
              where fr is 
the reification function In the given example we can reformulate 
the query as Who does barking and the corresponding DL rule 
Extension Rule Empty Input                    
4332  Problem of Desire Inclusion 
Some  inclusion  queries  may  have  desire  that  have  may  have  an 
intersection  with  input For  an  example  in  the query  What  kind 
of a water vehicle is also an air vehicle In such cases the base 
rule 11 is modified as 
Extension Rule Desire Inclusion               
4333  Problem of Quantitative how-Query 
In  how  queries  that  are  quantitative  in  nature  ie  R1    much 
many etc we need to introduce a primitive concept Count and a 
primitive  role  hasCount  where  for  any  arbitrary  satisfiable 
concept      the  following  axiom  holds                        
The hasCount is mapped to a function called fcount that calculates 
the  size  of  the  instances  of      at  any  given  point  of  time  For  an 
example in the query How many people live in New York the 
count  operator  works  on  the  desire  people  living  in  New  York 
The corresponding rule is 
Extension Rule Quantitative how 
4334  Problem of Temporal Adverbial Modifier 
Some queries have temporal adverbial tokens such as in the query 
What can be sometimes observed in the morning sky where R2 
observed  in  is  associated  with  a  temporal  adverbial  modifier 
sometimes  The  problem  with  formalizing  such  queries  is  that 
the  ontological  validity  of  the  desire  is  essentially  temporal  in 
nature In other words for the given example if a particular planet 
is  observed  in  the  morning  sky  it  is  not  so  that  it  will  always  be 
observed  like  the  sun  which  we  can  observe  every  day  Hence 
sun  cannot  be  a  candidate  answer  in  this  case  The  rule  for  such 
queries is as follows 
Extension Rule Temporal Adverbial sometimes 
                        
                                    
                                                  
4335  Problem of Superlative Modifier 
In some queries superlative tokens are included such as in What 
is  the  tallest  mountain  in  Europe  In  such  queries  the  desire  is 
for a specific instance that has the optimal maximal or minimal 
degree of measurable modifier of the desire class In the example 
tall  is  a  measurable  modifier  whose  superlative  form  is  maximal 
height  of  all  instances  of  the  desire  class  Mountain  The  height 
attribute  of  mountain  is  implicit  in  the  given  query  Keywords 
such as most and least are good indicators of deciding whether the 
computation  has  to  be  maximal  or  minimal  However  for  suffix 
based superlative tokens ie est it is not so evident The problem 
is how to know that tallest has to maximized while lowest has 
to be minimized We take a bootstrapping based approach with a 
seed  bag  of  measurable  modifiers  such  as  tall  long  big  low 
high  large  wide  etc  and  then  mapped  the  bootstrapped 
keywords  with  corresponding  plausible  attributes  denoted  AM 
For  an  example  we  get  pairs  such  as                        
                                                   
                        Based on such pairing we then classify 
the  modifiers 
that  requires 
maximization  such  as  tall  wide  etc  and  negative  modifiers 
those that requires minimization such as low The corresponding 
extension rule is 
into  positive  modifiers  those

5  EVALUATION 
51 Evaluation Goal and Metric  
Our  evaluation  aim  was  to  observe  the  accuracy  of  the  proposed 
QCT  We  leave  the  accuracy  evaluation  of  the  DL  formalization 
as a future work since that requires indirect comparative testing in 
terms  of  mean  average  precision  and  recall  on  some  of  the 
cutting-edge  knowledge  discovery  systems  However  it  is  to  be 
understood 
intrinsically dependent on the accuracy of QCT  
the  DL  formalization 
the  accuracy  of 
To  evaluate  QCT  we  decided  on  a  simple  Characterization 
Coverage  CC  measure  The  measure  is  modeled  to  understand 
how  many  different  linguistic  forms  of  simple  complex  and 
compound  wh-queries  in  English  can  be  identified  correctly  by 
QCT We measure CC in three perspectives i CC-Precision ii 
CC-Recall and iii CC-F1 score We define them as follows 
CC-Precision Given a test set of NL queries the CC-Precision is 
calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly identified queries 
NCI and the total number of identified queries in the test set NI  
CC-Recall  Given  a  test  set  of  NL  queries  the  CC-Recall  is 
calculated as the ratio of the number of correctly identified queries 
NCI and the total number of queries in the test set N  
CC-F1  The  Simple  Harmonic  Mean  of  CC-Precision  and  CC-
Recall is the CC-F1  
52 Experimental Results 
To  evaluate  CC  of  proposed  work  we  have  used  the  Microsoft 
Encarta  98  query  test  set  29  and  OWL-S  TC  dataset  The 
Microsoft  Question  Answering  Corpus  MSQA  which  is  aimed 
at querying documents belonging to the Encarta-98 encyclopedia 
The  test  set  contains  1365  usable  English  wh-queries  We 
excluded the queries of procedural how and why from this dataset 
We  have  categorized  simple  complex  and  compound  queries 
from  the  dataset  There  are  total  473  queries  of  procedural  how 
and why which are excluded The reduced dataset consist of total 
982 queries which is distributed among 676 simple 147 complex 
and  69  compound  wh-queries  The  accuracy  statistics  is  given  in 
table 5 We observe that the CC-Precision is 100 for all types of 
wh-queries  while  the  overall  CC-Recall  is  9450  The  perfect 
precision shows that the QCT is theoretically sound 
To  validate  our  results  with  Encarta  98  dataset  we  also  tested 
QCT  on  custom  query  dataset  built  on  top  of  OWL-S  TC  v40 
dataset6  The  OWL-S  TC  dataset  consists  of  service  descriptions 
of  1083  web  services  from  9  different  domains  A  service 
description  is  a  formal  specification  of  the  behavior  of  a  web 
service  in  terms  of  its  required  input  parameters  given  output 
parameters  and  other  binding  parametric  details  for  runtime 
execution  The  description  also  contains  a  short  NL  narrative  of 
the  overall  behavior  A  query  dataset  for  this  corpus  was 
developed by three research assistants The task for each of these 
three  assistants  was  to  formulate  a  wh-query  for  every  service 
such that the query desire matches the given output of the service 
and  query  input  matches  the  required  input  of  the  service  Since 
this  task  was  done  independently  we  observed  that  almost  in  all 
cases the syntactic structuring of the query for a given service by 
each  assistant  was  different  The  queries  were  simple  complex 
and compound with an average of 90 query of the form complex 
and compound Ideally the extracted query desire by QCT should 
be  semantically  equivalent 
corresponding web service specification Based on this notion we 
have  calculated  CC-precision  CC-recall  and  CC-F1  measure  for 
each  of  the  three  query  datasets  From  table  6  we  observed  that 
the  average  recall  was  9877  average  precision  100  and 
average  F1  was  9892  The  results  clearly  validate  the  earlier 
results with Microsoft Encarta 98
