Abstract The smallest dwarf galaxies are the most straight forward objects in
which to study star formation processes on a galactic scale They are typically single
cell star forming entities and as small potentials in orbit around a much larger one
they are unlikely to accrete much if any extraneous matter during their lifetime
either intergalactic gas or galaxies because they will typically lose the competition
with the much larger galaxy We can utilise observations of stars of a range of ages
to measure star formation and enrichment histories back to the earliest epochs
The most ancient objects we have ever observed in the Universe are stars found in
and around our Galaxy Their proximity allows us to extract from their properties
detailed information about the time in the early Universe into which they were born
A currently fashionable conjecture is that the earliest star formation in the Universe
occurred in the smallest dwarf galaxy sized objects
Here I will review some recent observational highlights in the study of dwarf
galaxies in the Local Group and the implications for understanding galaxy formation
and evolution

1 Introduction
One of the fundamental pillars of current structure formation models
the CDM paradigm is that small galaxies are the building blocks
of larger ones eg Navarro Frenk  White 1995 Thus the dwarf
galaxies around our Galaxy are arguably the remnants of the formation
of the Milky Way and as such provide a unique laboratory for the
detailed study of generic galactic assembly processes Whilst CDM has
been quite successful at modelling clusters of galaxies and large-scale
structure it currently faces problems on the small dwarf galaxy scale It
appears to over-predict the number and the mass spectrum of satellites
seen around galaxies such as our own eg Moore et al 1999 and
there also appear to be inconsistencies with regard to the timescale of
the build up of larger galaxies eg Prantzos  Silk 1998 and the
dierences in the stellar populations of large and small galaxies eg
Tolstoy et al 2002 These problems might arise only because we have
not yet made detailed enough studies of our neighbours there are still
quite a number of uncertainties in our interpretation of current obser-
vations However results to date provide some fairly sizeable obstacles
to the current standard implementation of CDM on small scales

look dierent in several crucial respects
2 The Local Group Dwarf Population
The majority of galaxies in the Local Group by number are Dwarf
Galaxies 35 out of 42 at the last count 17 dSph 5 dEs and 13 dIs
eg van den Bergh 2000 The denition of a dwarf galaxy is not a xed
one cf Tammann 1993 Half the galaxies in the Local Group have a
total mass Mtot  3  107M  and these fall into two classes dwarf
Spheroidals dSph and dwarf Irregulars dI These are the galaxies
considered in this review
21 Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies
Dwarf spheroidal galaxies dSph are the smallest faintest galaxies we
know of Within the Local Group they are mostly satellites of larger
systems such as our Galaxy and M 31 Some of these dSph formed
all their stars more than 1012 Gyr ago and have apparently done
nothing at all since then some have formed the majority of their
tolstoytex 26052011 800 p2
Dwarf Galaxies
stars at intermediate times 68 Gyr ago and a few have experi-
enced star formation as recently as 12 Gyr ago see Mateo 1998
and references therein All of the dSph galaxies without exception
have an ancient stellar population Even the oldest and simplest have
had a complex star formation history SFH and these systems with
virtually identical SFHs still have dierent CMDs from each other see
Figure 1 Perhaps this is a result of dierent environmental inuences
eg Mayer et al 2001 The evolution of dSph must be inuenced
maybe strongly by the presence of our Galaxy The dynamical friction
of their orbits may have a strong and varying inuence on the rate
of star formation SFR No dSph around our Galaxy currently has an
obviously associated ISM
22 Dwarf Irregular Galaxies
Dwarf Irregular dI galaxies have many similarities to dSph but they
typically contain HI gas often a large fraction by mass and also recent
star formation They all contain an underlying old stellar population
It is possible that they are dSph witnessed in a more active state If
a small dI stops forming stars for a few 100 Myr it may look like a
dSph However in general dI appear to have had a more constant
less disrupted SFR over time and have also typically attained higher
metallicities than dSph Perhaps dI unlike dSph are suciently mas-
sive to attain the threshold for retaining their ISM during supernova
explosions eg Ferrara  Tolstoy 2000 or are not so disrupted by
their environment being typically more distant from larger systems
they can sustain a more or less constant SFR albeit at a low level
over their history
3 Observations of Nearby Dwarf Galaxies
There are many dierent approaches to studying the evolutionary his-
tory of a galaxy and the most reliable is to look directly at the detailed
properties of individual stars This is however restricted to galaxies
in the very nearby Universe Although there is much to be learnt from
studies of integrated properties of more distant dwarf galaxies 2 Mpc
away I will not address this subject at all
31 Imaging
The only way to measure the properties of a signicant fraction of the
resolved stellar population in a galaxy is through multi-colour imaging
The Hubble Space Telescope HST has produced signicant advances

Figure 2 Dierent SFHs for Carina dSph from the literature arbitrarily nor-
malised Dashed lines from Hurley-Keller et al 1998  HK98 from wide-eld
ground-based CTIO imaging The solid line Hernandez et al 2000  H00 and
dotted line Dolphin 2002  D02 use the same HSTWFPC2 dataset There are
clear dierences between the three HK98 in contrast to H00 and D02 see discrete
bursts of star formation This might be because HK98 are better able to resolve
such details because they cover a much larger area of the galaxy and hence all the
MSTOs are much better populated than in the tiny HST eld used by the other two
studies Also D02 and HK98 nd evidence of ancient star-formation as expected
from the RR Lyr population detected by Saha Seitzer  Monet 1986 whereas
H00 do not The most critical dierence is the assumed metallicity not only the
absolute value but the spread D02 nds FeH1204 where as HK98 assumes
FeH2101 and H00 FeH2002
in this eld over the last ten years eg see Tolstoy 2000 and references
therein It has allowed the detailed analysis of Colour-Magnitude Di-
agrams CMDs of resolved stellar populations to determine SFHs out
to distances around 5 Mpc However the most detailed studies come
from galaxies within the Local Group at less than 1 Mpc distance see
Tolstoy 2000 and references therein
The dSph around the Milky Way are among the few galaxies in the
Universe for which we have accurate main sequence turno MSTO
ages going back to the epoch of earliest star formation eg Carina
Hurley-Keller Mateo  Nemec 1998 Leo I Gallart et al 1999 Fornax
Buonanno et al 1999 MSTOs are the most accurate measurements
of the age distribution of a stellar population and even so there are
problems in converting turno luminosities and colours into accurate
absolute ages and thus CMDs into SFHs see Figure 2 This revolves
around the well known and much lamented age-metallicity degeneracy
It means that without independent metallicity information it is not
possible to uniquely determine the age of a star from its colour and
magnitude alone A major dierence between the SFH determinations

in Figure 2 is the dierent metallicity evolution determined or assumed
by each study
32 Spectroscopy
As telescopes are increasing in size and spectrographs are becoming
more sensitive and multiplexing capabilites are increasing it is possible
to take spectra of a signicant number of individual stars in nearby
galaxies and determine the abundances of many dierent elements and
thus help to overcome the degeneracy inherent in photometric measure-
ments FLAMES on the VLT with its 130 bres over a 25 diameter
eld of view is eagerly awaited in this respect
321 Medium Resolution The Ca II Triplet
The VLT instruments FORS1 and FORS2 in multi-object spectroscopy
mode are ideal for intermediate resolution spectroscopy of individual
stars in dwarf galaxies to determine metallicities eg Tolstoy et al
2001 and radial velocities eg Tolstoy  Irwin 2000 Irwin  Tolstoy
2002 from the Ca II triplet CaT lines for a signicant number of
RGB stars Although the CaT provides a basic estimate of FeH it
was found to be broadly consistent with subsequent high resolution
UVES observations Tolstoy et al 2002 This is thus a valuable method
of obtaining FeH estimates at distances beyond the limits of high
resolution spectroscopy  250 kpc This is the only way to determine
abundances of RGB stars of dierent ages in dI galaxies all of which
are more distant than 450 kpc
322 High Resolution Full Abundance Analysis
With High Resolution Spectrographs such as UVES on the VLT we can
observe individual stars in nearby dwarf galaxies and seek answers to
detailed questions about the enrichment history of a variety of dierent
elements within galaxies other than our own eg Tolstoy et al 2002
Shetrone et al 2002 Abundance patterns can constrain the eects of
the SFH on chemical evolution eg McWilliam 1997
A wealth of information is available in every high resolution spec-
trum The elemental abundances that can be measured fall into four
broad categories
The Light Elements eg O Na Mg Al allow us to trace deep-
mixing abundance patterns in RGB stars This is a very distinctive
pattern that is markedly dierent in globular cluster and eld stars
The -elements eg O Mg Si Ca Ti the production of which is
dominated by Type II Supernovae The -abundance limits the number
that can have polluted the gas from which the star was made They also

et al 2001 plotted versus FeH The triangle and circle symbols are the individual
stars observed in Carina Leo I Sculptor Fornax Draco Ursa Minor and Sextans
see Tolstoy et al for more details The crosses at FeH 1 are Galactic disk
star measurements from Edvardsson et al 1993 the open squares are halo data
from McWilliam et al 1995 and the stars are UVES data from a study of LMC star
clusters of dierent ages from Hill et al 2000 Crosses at FeH  1 are Galactic
globular cluster measurements gc A representative error bar is also plotted This
plot highlights the dierences between the -element abundances of stars observed
in dierent environments
aect the age estimates based on RGB isochrones as lower -tracks are
bluer than high -tracks
The Fe-Peak elements eg V Cr Mn Co Ni Cu Zn are mostly
believed to be the products of explosive nucleosynthesis They can
in principle limit the most massive progenitor to have exploded in
a galaxy eg Woosley  Weaver 1995
Heavy Metals eg Y Ba Ce Sm Eu enable a distinction to be
made between the fraction of s-process and r-process elements in a
star and thus put detailed constraints on the number and type of past
Supernovae explosions The BaEu ratio appears to be an indicator of
the contribution of AGB stars to the chemical evolution process which
provides yet another measure of the timescale for chemical enrichment
4 Understanding the Chemical Evolution of Galaxies
A sample of 15 RGB stars were observed in 4 southern dSph Sculptor
Fornax Carina and Leo I with VLTUVES Shetrone et al 2002
Tolstoy et al 2002 and 17 RGB stars were observed in 3 northern
dSph Draco Ursa Minor Sextans with KeckHIRES Shetrone Bolte
 Stetson 1998 Shetrone Cote  Sargent 2001 Combining these sur-
veys gives us detailed abundances for individual stars in dSph around
tolstoytex 26052011 800 p6
Dwarf Galaxies
our Galaxy covering a range of SFHs There have also been detailed
abundance studies in LMC star clusters eg Hill et al 2000 and also
in the disk of our Galaxy Edvardsson et al 1993 and in our halo
McWilliam et al 1995 which allow us to compare dSph with other
environments eg the -elements see Figure 3
The -abundances can be plotted both in the traditional manner
against FeH see Figure 3 and against age see Figure 4 Both
provide diering insights as to how galaxies are evolving with time
and also how observations of stars in dSph compare to those in our
Galaxy and in the Magellanic Clouds Plotting against age is more
useful from the point of view of understanding chemical evolution but
it is not easy to nd suitable measurements with which to compare
dSph results as it is challenging to determine accurate ages for stars
in our Galaxy It is somewhat more straight forward in the simpler
environment of dSph although care is still required
The dSph -abundances when plotted against age appear to follow
the same distribution as those for our disk and the LMC star clusters
see Tolstoy et al 2002 However if we look at the plot of  versus
FeH in Figure 3 the properties of dSph are signicantly dierent
from the disk in the sense that although the levels and the variation
with stellar age of the -elements are similar this is occurring at sig-
nicantly lower FeH in the dSph Figure 3 shows that the properties
of the dSph dier from those typical of halo stars although there is
overlap such that the Fe of the halo stars are typically higher It is
as if all stars know the mass of the potential in which they are forming
41 Interpretation of Abundances
The low Fe found in the disk stars of our Galaxy has been inter-
preted as evidence for star-formation in material with a large fraction of
Supernovae Ia ejecta eg Tinsley 1979 Gilmore  Wyse 1991 This
is perhaps not surprising for our disk with high metallicity and typical
predictions of fairly recent formation from pre-enriched material It
is not clear that the same assessment can be made of the similarly low
Fe for stars in dSph galaxies The same low Fe is also found in
the oldest stars which is at odds with the Supernovae Ia time scale
This might be a remnant of the initial enrichment of the dSph gas in
the early universe by a process quite dierent from the star formation
we see today
Everything we know about dwarf galaxies suggests that they have
never had very high SFRs The stars in dSph typically have much lower
FeH and OH than in our disk The low SFR means that Super-
novae II products may predominately come from low mass 812M

Age Gyr
Figure 4 An illustrative scenario which might allow us to tie in our determinations
of star formation history with Fe for each galaxy see Tolstoy et al 2002 for
more details and caveats The symbols are dened as in Figure 3 Representative
error bars are plotted It is obvious that the dashed lines cannot be constrained with
the few data we have
progenitors which result in lower Fe than their higher mass cousins
eg Woosley  Weaver 1995 This is unfortunately eectively a
truncated IMF but it is motivated by the likelihood that in the physical
conditions to be found in small galaxies the probability of forming high
mass molecular clouds and thus high mass stars is low
With the recent results of Tolstoy et al 2002 and Shetrone et al
2001 it is for the rst time possible to directly measure the Fe
evolution as well as other elements of the stellar populations of dSph
over Gyr time scales back from the earliest epoch of formation to the
most recent star formation The range of variation in Fe is quite
small which means accurate measurements are required to observe it
and it never reaches the parameter space where the disk and halo are
stars predominantly to be found So probably star formation when it
occurs always occurs at similarly low levels in these small galaxies
tolstoytex 26052011 800 p8
Dwarf Galaxies
In Figure 4 the Fe vs age for stars in four dSph galaxies is plotted
separately and over-plotted is an illustrative estimate of the variation
of Fe for each galaxy given the star formation rate variation There
really are not sucient data on these galaxies to be certain that we are
seeing direct evidence of evolution in Fe but the results are highly
suggestive The dashed lines are not derived from the SFH directly but
a knowledge of the SFH is used to nd the most likely pattern with
time in Fe Carina for example has the most impressive evidence
for evolution of abundances due to variations in star formation rates
The variations seen in the  abundances are supported by consistent
variations in Ba La Nd and Eu see Shetrone et al 2002 However
more data are needed to conrm these speculations
42 The Bottom Line for CDM
The most recent VLTUVES results Tolstoy et al 2002 combined
with KeckHIRES data Shetrone et al 2001 unequivocally show that
the stars observed in dSph galaxies today many of which are extremely
old cannot be used to make up a signicant fraction of the stellar
mass in our Galaxy neither in the disk nor in the inner-halo nor the
bulge because their nucleosynthetic signatures are not compatible
This places a limit on the time redshift at which the majority of
merging of small halos must have occurred to create the Milky Way
if this is indeed to be the formation mechanism This is of course
assuming that the initial small halos are similar to the dwarf galaxies
we see today These recent abundance measurements require that the
majority of these kinds of mergers must have occurred very early in
the rst few Gyr of structure formation because this is the only way
to ensure that the majority of star formation will occur in a deep
potential with the requisite conditions for massive star formation to
explain the abundance patterns seen in our Galaxy but not in dSph
ie mergers will add mostly gas to the larger system but few stars
More data is needed to put these initial results on a rm statistical
basis and of course dSph results do not place any limits on the eect of
signicantly larger accretions eg LMC like objects However there
are suggestions that the abundance patterns of stars in the Clouds and
other nearby Irregulars do not resemble our Galaxy anymore than the
dSph do eg Hill et al 2000 Venn et al 2002 in prep
The only component of our Galaxy which could plausibly contain
a signicant contribution from stars formed in accreted dwarf galaxies
is the halo eg Nissen  Schuster 1997 and it contains only about
1 of the stellar mass of our Galaxy eg Morrison 1993 and only a
tolstoytex 26052011 800 p9

fraction of this the outer-halo  10 could plausibly include stars
accreted from dwarf galaxies eg Unavane Wyse  Gilmore 1996
