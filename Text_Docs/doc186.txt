ABSTRACT
Aims Following the study already presented in our previous paper based on the Nordic Optical Telescope NOT sample which
consists of ve clusters of galaxies within the redshift range 018  z  025 imaged in the central 05-2 Mpc in very good seeing
conditions we have studied the quantitative morphology of their bright galaxy population
Methods We have analyzed the surface brightness proles of the galaxy population in those clusters Previously we have performed
simulations in order to check the reliability of the ts We have also derived a quantitative morphological classication
Results The structural parameters derived from these analysis have been analyzed We have obtained that the structural parameters
of ES0 galaxies are similar to those showed by galaxies in low redshift clusters However the disc scales are dierent In particular
the scales of the discs of galaxies at medium redshift clusters are statistically dierent than those located in similar galaxies in the
Coma cluster But the scales of the discs of galaxies in medium redshift clusters are similar to nearby eld galaxies
Conclusions The results suggest that the evolution of the disc component of galaxies in clusters is faster than in eld ones
Mechanisms like galaxy harassment showing timescales of  1Gyr could be the responsible of this disc scale evolution This in-
dicates that spiral galaxies in clusters have suered a strong evolution in the last 25 Gyr or that Coma is in some way anomalous

1 Introduction
The brightest galaxies in the central part of clusters of galax-
ies have been an object of study for years Kormendy

Jorgensen  Franx
1994 Kaumann Guiderdoni  White
1994 Bower Kodama  Terlevich 1998 Fasano et al 2000
Aguerri et al 2004 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 Ascaso et al
2008 Most of these studies have investigated their link with
the formation of their host halo leading to two main scenarios
the monolithic Merritt 1984 Bower Kodama  Terlevich
1998 and the hierarchical Kaumann Guiderdoni  White
1994 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 The former assumes the
cluster to be formed rst and consequently the galaxies are
not suering transformations after the cluster collapse The
latter on the other hand implies that the galaxies were formed
earlier than the cluster and therefore environmental eects or
interacting mechanisms such as harassment Moore et al 1996

are able to alter the galaxy population
The galaxy population has a bimodal nature based on their
stellar population and the shape of their surface brightness pro-
les As Driver et al 2006 showed the redder and more com-
pact objects are usually early-type systems while the late-type
galaxies are generally bluer and less concentrated proles
Recent results Ascaso 2008 Bell 2008 Skibba et al 2008
Cameron  Driver 2009 have pointed out that this bi-modal be-
haviour for eld and cluster galaxies can be translated in the
color-logn plane where n is the Sersic index Sersic 1968 up
to redshift 1 This result agrees with the hierarchical clustering
scenario as the late type galaxy population would be formed by
cooling the gas in the dark matter halos and as a consequence
the early type population would be formed by merging of late
type galaxy members or by dry-merging of the early type galax-
Many works related to the evolution of the galaxy popu-
lation in clusters of galaxies have also shown a decrease of
the S0E fraction with redshift This decrement is mainly due
to the variation with redshift of the S0 fraction while the
Elliptical fraction remains constant up to z  08 Fasano et al
2000 Dressler et al 1997 Postman et al 2005 Desai et al
2007 This fact indicates a dierent time scale for the pro-
cess of formation of elliptical and lenticular galaxies However
Jorgensen  Franx 1994 studied the nature of elliptical and
S0 galaxies in the Coma cluster suggesting that
they are
a continuum class of objects as a distribution of bulge-to-
disk ratios Subsequent studies have given support to this fact
Jrgensen Franx  Kjaergaard 1996 Krajnovic et al 2008
Ascaso et al Bright galaxy population of ve medium redshift clusters II
Likewise a number of papers reect a continuity in the pa-
rameter space for bright elliptical and dwarf galaxies in clusters
Sandage  Visvanathan 1978 Graham 2003 Gutierrez et al
2004 Aguerri et al 2004 Ascaso et al 2008 suggesting that
these objects could be a continous family However recent
studies have been devoted to the study of the physical dif-
ferences between elliptical and spheroidal or dwarf ellipti-
cal galaxies Aguerri et al 2005 Aguerri  Gonzalez-Garca
2009 Kormendy et al 2008 suggesting recent evolution in their
structural parameters For example Kormendy et al 2008 have
shown that the bright MVT  2166 elliptical galaxies in the
Virgo cluster have cuspy cores rotate slowly have anisotropic
velocity distributions boxy isophotes and Sersic values n larger
than 4 while the faint ellipticals 2154  MVT  1553 do
not have cores rotate much faster usually have more isotropic
velocity distributions disky isophotes and smaller Sersic param-
eters In addition they conrm that the biggest elliptical galaxies
have X-ray emitting gas whereas the smallest ones have a lack
of it Therefore the existence of larger samples of faint dwarf
galaxies at medium-higher redshift is necessary to study their
evolution
The inspection of the galaxy surface brightness and main
structural parameters has been studied in several works for dif-
ferent samples Those samples have been restricted to local clus-
ters Caon et al 1993 Jorgensen  Franx 1994 Aguerri et al
2004 Gutierrez et al 2004 or to galaxy samples preselected
by morphological type eg early types Caon et al 1993
Jorgensen  Franx 1994 Graham 2003 or late types De Jong
1996 Graham 2001 2003 Mollenho 2004 In addition
larger samples of eld galaxies have been analyzed For exam-
ple Trujillo  Aguerri 2004 presented quantitative structural
parameters in the V-band rest-frame for all galaxies with z  1
and I814AB  245 mag in the Hubble Deep Fields North
and South Nevertheless the present number of works devoted
to the study of global samples of galaxies in clusters at medium
redshift range is small Fasano et al 2000 Trujillo et al 2001
Balogh et al 2002 In this work we have studied the surface
brightness of the whole galaxy population in a sample of clus-
ters of galaxies at medium redshift
Our data consists of ve clusters observed with the Nordic
Optical Telescope NOT in very good seeing conditions with
two lters in a range of redshift from 018 to 025 where there
are very few cases of analysed clusters due to diculties in the
deepness and quality of the observations The analysis of the
properties of such clusters can provide a new perspective in the
evolutionary trends of clusters at that range of redshift as well
as the extension of the properties of other samples at low red-
shift to high redshift HST
In this paper we have continued the analysis of the prop-
erties of the brightest galaxies mr  20 in the central part of
this cluster sample at medium redshift We have analyzed their
surface brightness and performed an study of their structural pa-
rameters We have also extracted their quantitative morphology
and compared this to their visual morphology already derived in
Ascaso et al 2008
The structure of this paper is as follows In section 2 we de-
scribe our sample and its analysis and we explain how we have
tted the surface brightness analysis into a one- Sersic prole
Sersic 1968 or a two-component prole Sersic Exponential
prole Freeman 1970 In section 3 we explain and show the
results of the simulations for the establishment of the range of
the parameters where we can t the dierent models In section
4 we describe the galaxy classication and analyze the structural
parameters extracted from the surface brightness ts for bulge
and disc galaxies Finally we show the discussion of the re-
sults and conclusion in section 5 Throughout that paper we have
adopted a CDM cosmology H071 km s1 Mpc1 m027
and 073
2 Data analysis
We have extended our study to the data previously presented in
Ascaso et al 2008 of ve clusters of galaxies imaged with the
Stand Camera of the 25m Nordic Optical Telescope NOT lo-
cated at the Roque de Los Muchachos Observatory La Palma
The main characteristics of the sample are collected in Table 1
We refer the reader to Fasano et al 2000 for more extended
details about the observations and the data reduction process
The detection and extraction of the galaxy sample is widely ex-
plained in Ascaso et al 2008
21 Twodimensionalsurfacebrightnesst
The surface brightness of the galaxies in our medium redshift
clusters were modelled using one or two photometrical com-
ponents The ts were carried out using the automatic tting
routine GASP-2D developed and successfully validated by
Mendez-Abreu et al 2008 The surface brightness of those
galaxies modelled with only one component was described by a
Sersic law Sersic 1968 while the surface brightness of those
galaxies tted with two photometrical components were de-
scribed by a Sersic law plus an exponential one Freeman 1970
The ts of the galaxies were fully two-dimensional The pho-
tometrical galaxy components were characterized by elliptical
and concentric isophotes with constant but possibly dierent
ellipticity and position angle We have asumed a cartesian co-
ordinates system x y z with origin in the galaxy center the x-
axis parallel to the direction of the right ascension and pointing
westward the y-axis parallel to the direction of declination and
pointing northward and the z-axis along the line-of-sight and
pointing toward the observer The plane of the sky is conned to
the x y plane and the galaxy center is located at the position
xo yo
The Sersic law has been extensively used in the lit-
erature to model the surface brightness of elliptical galax-
ies Graham  Guzman 2003 Graham  Driver 2005 bulges
of early and late-type galaxies
Prieto et al 2001 Aguerri et al 2004 Mollenho 2004 the
low surface brightness host of blue compact galaxies Caon et al
2005 Amorin et al 2007 Amorn et al 2009 and dwarf ellipti-
cal galaxies Binggeli  Jerjen 1998 Graham  Guzman 2003
Aguerri et al 2005 The radial variation of the intensity of this
law is given by
Andredakis et al
Ir  Ie10bnrre1n 1
where re Ie and n are the eective radius the intensity at re
and a shape parameter respectively The value of bn  0868n 
0142 is coupled to n so that half of the total luminosity is within
re see Caon et al 1993 The isophotes of the Sersic models
are concentred ellipses centred at xo yo with constant position
angle PAb and constant ellipticity b  1  qb Thus the radius
rb is given by
rb  x  xosinPAb  y  yocosPAb2
x  xocosPAb  y  yosinPAb2q2
Ascaso et al Bright galaxy population of ve medium redshift clusters II
Hereafter we will call bulge the photometric galaxy com-
ponent tted by a Sersic law in those galaxies tted with two
components
On the other hand the exponential law has been used in the
literature to model the surface brightness prole of the discs
showed by spiral galaxies eg Aguerri et al 2005 and refer-
ences therein This law was proposed by Freeman 1970 and is
given by
Ir  I0erd h
where I0 and h are the central intensity and scale length re-
spectively Similar to the photometrical component modelled by
a Sersic law we have considered that the disc isophotes are el-
lipses centered on the galaxy center xo yo with constant posi-
tion angle PAd and constant ellipticity d  1  qd given by the
galaxy inclination i  arcosqd Thus the radius rd is given by
rd  x  xosinPAd  y  yocosPAd2
x  xocosPAd  y  yosinPAd2q2
The GASP-2D routine ts all free parameters iteratively us-
ing a non-linear least-squares minimization method It was based
on the robust Levenberg-Marquardt method Press et al 1992
During each iteration of the tted algorithm the seeing eect
was taken into account by convolving the model image with a
circular point spread function PSF extracted from the images
see Mendez-Abreu et al 2008 for more details about the t-
ting routine
As many authors have recently explored Gadotti 2008
Cameron  Driver 2009 the presence of bars in the galax-
ies may result in poor bulge ts if not correctly modelled
Nevertheless we have taken care of that by examining carefully
the residuals
3 Simulations
One of the advantages of the quantitative morphology is that the
accuracy of the obtained results can be tested by simulating ar-
ticial galaxies similar to the real ones We have created a large
number of articial galaxies with one and two galactic compo-
nents described by the previous equations These modeled galax-
ies are similar to the galaxies observed in our medium redshift
galaxy clusters
We generated 5000 images of galaxies with a Sersic compo-
nent The total magnitude eective radius shape Sersic parame-
ter and ellipticity of the simulated galaxies were similar to those
from real galaxies They were asigned randomly to the models
and their values were in the ranges

re n and b errors for the parameters of the Sersic prole The
horizontal dashed lines are the 20 of the error The green and
red lines are the quartile and percentile of the error respectively
in bins
The disc free parameters of the galaxies were
175kpc  h  7kpc

In order to mimic the same instrumental setup we added a
background level and photon noise to these articial images sim-
ilar to the observed images They were also convolved simulat-
ing the seeing that we have in our observations Finally these
simulated galaxies were tted with identical conditions as the
real ones The simulated galaxies will be used for determining
the errors of the tted structural parameters
31 Galaxieswithonephotometricalcomponent
Figure 1 shows the errors of the free parameters of those sim-
ulated galaxies with only one component as a function of their
magnitude absolute errors for e and relative errors for re n and
b Notice that bright galaxies show small relative errors in the
tted parameters than faint ones Consequently the goodnes of
the t depends on the galaxy magnitudes or due to the correla-
tion between area and magnitude on the galaxy area The areas
of the objects were computed as the number of pixels with higher
signal than 15 times the rms of the sky background of the im-
ages and belonging to the intersection of the observed image
and the tted model The last restriction was imposed in order to
avoid wrong area measurements due to nearby objects
We have considered that a galaxy was properly tted when
all free parameters were recovered with relative errors less than
20 Figure 2 shows the fraction of properly tted simulated
galaxies as a function of the area We dened the minimum
area of properly tted galaxies as the one at which the fraction
showed in Fig 2 is equal to 05 This correspond to 550 pix-
els for galaxies modeled with only one Sersic component This
means that more than 50 of the galaxies with areas larger than
550 pixels were properly tted

We have also generated 5000 galaxies with two photomet-
ric components Sersic and exponential These articial galax-
ies have a central photometric bulge component modeled by a
Sersic law and an external disc component modeled by an ex-
ponential law The total magnitude of these galaxies span a range
18  mr  21 The contribution to the total light of the galaxies
by the bulge and disc components is given by the bulge-to-total
light ratio This parameter spreads over the range 0  BT  1

33 Numberofcomponents
The simulations have showed that all galaxies with area larger
than 800 pixels can be properly tted This area corresponds to
galaxies brighter than mr  20 Thus all the galaxies down to
mr  20 were tted with one and two components As far as the
galaxies with areas comprised between 550 and 800 pixels are
concerned we didnt include them in our analysis
Usually the 2 value is used for deciding which is the best
tted model Nevertheless models with two components tend to
have smaller values of 2 than models with one component This
fact is due to the dierent number of free parameters between
both ts Additionally it is also possible that the model with
the lowest value of 2 could not be a physical solution What is
more luminous well resolved galaxies with spiral arms or inner
dust-lanes that can not be properly described by the model tend
to have larger values of 2 For these reasons we have adopted
an alternatively method in order to decide the best tted photo-
metric model The method is similar to the used by Allen et al
2006 It is based on the analysis of the surface brightness ra-
dial proles of the tted models Our aim is that those galaxies
nally tted with two components should be classical bulge
and disc systems ie their central regions should be dominated
by the bulge component while the disc dominates at large radial
distances from the galaxy center Galaxies with dierent light
distribution were tted with only one component
We have implemented a decision tree algorithm in order to
nd the best nal number of structural components for each
galaxy The algorithm starts by comparing the magnitude of the
galaxy obtained from the two component t and the magnitude
measured directly in the image using SExtractor If the dierence
between those magnitudes is larger than 05 mag then the galaxy
was tted with only one component this case only happened
for a 232 of the galaxies in our sample This large dierence
between the modelled and measured magnitudes could be due
to several reasons such as the presence of more than two struc-
tural components in the galaxies or the bad convergence of the
tted method In the second step of the algorithm we have anal-
ysed the bulge-to-total BT  ratio given by the two component
t Those galaxies clearly dominated by the Sersic components
BT 07 were also tted with only one component
The remaining galaxies were analyzed following a similar
procedure as in Allen et al 2006 We have identied ve dif-
ferent types of tted surface brightness proles see Fig 5
According with the number of intersections between the Sersic
and the exponential tted radial proles we can identify those
with one Type 1 Type 2 and Type 4 two Type 3 and zero
Type 5 intersections Type 1 proles were considered as clas-
sical bulge plus disc galaxies The remaining types have dier-
ent features that make them to departure from a classical two
component galaxy Galaxies belonging to Type 5 show bulges
dominating in the whole galaxy Type 4 galaxies have a disc
component dominating in the inner regions of the prole Type 3
galaxies show bulge eective radius larger than the disc eective
radius 1676h and Type 2 galaxies refer to those galaxies whose
Sersic parameter n has reached the maximum value allowed in
the t

component simulated galaxies

Figure 4 shows the relative errors of the tted free parameters of
the simulated galaxies with bulge and disc components except
for e and 0 where we show the absolute errors Notice that in
general the disc parameters are better tted than the bulge ones
It is also clear that those galaxies with large BT show larger
errors in the disc parameters than in the bulge ones In contrast
galaxies with smaller BT show larger errors in the bulge than in
the disc Indeed the bulge and disc parameters for faint galaxies
mr  20 with low surface brightness 0D  250 or 0B 
253 mag arcsec2 are not well tted
We have also considered that a galaxy was properly tted if
all free parameters were recovered with relative errors smaller
than 20 Figure 3 shows the fraction of properly tted bulge
and disc simulated galaxies In this case the area at which at
least 50 of the population is well tted depends on their BT
values We have adopted in this case 800 pixels as the minimum
area in order to obtain reliable ts

ies as a function of their area The full line represents galaxies

41 SersicParameters
In the present section we will compare the Sersic parameters of
the galaxies in the sample with similar galaxies located in local
galaxy clusters
Kormendy 1977 discovered a correlation between the
size and the surface brightness  e  -re of ellipti-
cal galaxies
the so called Kormendy Relation Later on
Binggeli Sandage  Tarenghi 1984 found that this relation-
ship was only given in elliptical galaxies brighter than MB 
20 For fainter galaxies the tendency inverts
In Figure 6 we have plotted the Kormendy relation for ES0
red points and the bulges of Early Spirals Green triangles
Notice that bulges of early-spirals and ES0 galaxies form a con-
tinuous family of objects The t of this relation for both types
is given by
Fig 5 Examples of proles 1 to 5 following the notation of
Allen et al 2006 The black solid lines represent the galaxies
surface brightness proles and the black dashed lines show the
errors limits The red dotted lines are the Sersic prole ts the
blue dashed lines are the disc prole ts and the green dashed
dotted lines are the sum of bulge and disc proles ts
Eventually only the galaxies with Type 1 proles were con-
sidered as two component ts The remaining were tted with
only one component We obtained nally that 47 of the galax-
ies were tted with one Sersic component
4 Structural parameters
The study of correlations between the structural parame-
ters of galaxies have been extensively investigated at
redshift
in the literature eg De Jong 1996 Graham
2001 Graham 2003 MacArthur Courteau  Holtzmann
2003Mollenho 2004Aguerri et al 2004Gutierrez et al
2004Aguerri et al 2005 Our galaxy cluster sample is lo-
cated at a mean redshift of  02 and gives us the chance to
compare the structural parameters of these galaxies with simi-
lar ones located in nearby clusters This comparison will enable
us to determine any evolution of the structural parameters of the
galaxies in clusters in the last  25 Gyr
We have classied the galaxies taking into account the num-
ber of tted photometrical components and their B-r colors
Three diferent galaxy types were considered early-types ES0
early-spirals Spe and late-spirals Spe The results of the t for
the galaxy sample together with their quantitative classication
are shown in the Table A1 in the Appendix
The early-type galaxies were those tted with one Sersic
component and located in the red sequence of the color-
magnitude relations CMR of the clusters within 02 magni-
tudes Early-type spirals were those tted with two structural
components and also located near the red secuence of the CMR
Finally late-type spirals were those objects tted with two com-
ponents and have at least 02 bluer B-r color than the red se-
cuence of the cluster This classication results than 36 29
and 16 of the galaxies were early-type early-spirals and late-
spirals respectively The remaining 19 of the objects corre-
spond to blue galaxies tted with only one component These
objects could be a mix of dierent kind of objects galaxies with
more than two galactic components blue spirals not well tted
with two components irregular galaxies blue ellipticals

Red points are ES0 galaxies while green triangles represent the
bulges of the Early Spiral galaxies The solid line is the t of the
relation

This t gives that early-type galaxies brighter than mr  20
in clusters at z02 follows the relation LV  r112008
relation is close to that observed for local early-type galaxies
given by LB  r13
 Binggeli Sandage  Tarenghi 1984
We have also plotted in Figure 7 the relation between
eective-radius and shape parameters for red galaxies tted with
one component red points and blue galaxies tted with one
component blue triangles Clearly a dichotomy exists By tak-
ing out the obvious outliers we have obtained the following ts
log n  026  013  021  017 logre
and for the blue ones
log n  004  016  003  019 logre
These ts are in agreement with recent measurements of the
Sersic indexes in wider samples of galaxies Driver et al 2006
Bell 2008 giving support to the hypothesis that the origin and
formation of these two kinds of galaxies is dierent The red and
blue population are located in split and parallel regions within
Ascaso et al Bright galaxy population of ve medium redshift clusters II
the errors in the slopes in the logn  logre plane This re-
sult allows to reliably separate the early and late type galaxies
by identifying the value of their Sersic parameter and inversely
we can assign a particular shape to a galaxy by determining its
color As a consequence we can conclude that the galaxies tted
with one component have a bimodal behavior The red early-type
galaxy population has an n value of 2  n  4 while the blue
late-type galaxy population has a shape parameter n  1
Fig 7 Relation between eective ratius and shape parameter for
one component galaxies Red points refer to red-one-component
galaxies and blue triangles represent blue-one-component galax-
ies Solid and dotted lines are the respective ts
We have found two blue galaxies with a Sersic index sim-
ilar to the red galaxies in the sample These galaxies are at
560 kpc distance from the core of A1878 a cluster which in
our previous work Ascaso et al 2008 was shown to have a
large blue fraction as well as an spiral dominated population
Those objects could be blue early-type galaxies results of merg-
ers Bildfell et al 2008 Pipino  Matteucci 2008 spiral galax-
ies with some features such as bars or dust or galaxies in pro-
cess of merging As far as the three red galaxies with smaller
Sersic proles are concerned one of them is visually classied
as Spiral so it might have been classied in one component but
are real spiral galaxies the two other ones have been classied
as Ellipticals but a closer inspection of them shows that they are
in clear interaction
Furthermore in the Figure 8 we have shown the eective
surface brightness the shape parameter and eective radius ver-
sus the absolute magnitude left column and color right col-
umn for the ES0 galaxies red points and the bulges of the
Early Spiral galaxies green triangles We can see that the B  r
colors of bulges of Early-type spirals and ES0 galaxies are sim-
ilar median B  r  204 and 206 respectively In general
bulges of early-type Spiral galaxies show fainter  e  me-
dian value is 2105 mag arc sec2 and smaller re median value
is 202 kpc and n median value is 221 Sersic parameters than
ES0 galaxies median values are 2179 mag arc sec2 646 kpc
and 242 respectively The plane logre  Mr shows a clear con-
tinuous relation between Early-type bulges and ES0 galaxies as
pointed before by the Kormendy relation
Finally we have compared the scales of our ES0 galax-
ies with those from similar objects in the Coma cluster
Aguerri et al 2004 Early-type Coma galaxies were selected
Fig 8 Absolute Gunn-r Magnitude left column and B-r colour
right column versus  e  n and BT for ES0 Red points
and Early Spirals Bulges Green Triangles
as those galaxies with BT  1 and were tted with one com-
ponent Due to the seeing eect we have not measured galaxies
with scales smaller than 22 kpc For this reason only galaxies
in Coma with re22 kpc were considered We obtained that the
sizes of our early-type galaxies turned out to be similar to the
Coma cluster galaxies see Table 2
As far as the shape parameter is concerned the range of val-
ues in the NOT sample expands all the range of values of Coma
However we nd a mean value somewhat smaller for the NOT
sample than for Coma but the values agree within the errors
Therefore it seems that the bulge sizes havent changed sub-
stantially with respect to those in the Coma Cluster
42 DiscParameters
The analysis of the structural parameters of the galaxies in clus-
ters gives information about the role played by the environment
in the evolution of galaxies in high density environments Fast
galaxy-galaxy encounters can transform galaxies from late- to
early-type in short time-scales  1Gyr These kind of encoun-
ters are usual in galaxy clusters Moore et al 1996 The stars
located in galactic discs have a lower binding energy than those
located in the central regions of the galaxies Thus interactions
can strip away easier stars located in the external regions of the
galaxies and truncate the discs There are hints about this trun-
cation in the literature Coma cluster galaxies have shorter discs
than eld nearby galaxies Gutierrez et al 2004 Aguerri et al
2004 Few facts are known about the evolution of discs at
medium redshift in galaxy clusters In the present section we
have compared the discs of the galaxies located in our medium
redshift clusters with similar ones in the local environment
We have plotted in Fig 9 the absolute magnitudes of the disks
versus their scale parameters The red diamonds concerns our

two component galaxies There are no discs in the medium red-
shift clusters with scales h  24 kpc This is due to our mini-
mum cut area 800 pixels and to the surface brightness limit
tted corresponding to r  253mag arcsec2 The horizontal
dotted line overplotted in Fig 9 shows this limit
Let us note that our disc scales are as large as those of
eld galaxies while those discs in Coma represent a minimum
percentage Figure 9 represents the well known Freeman law
Freeman 1970 The t of this law for our disk sample is given
log h  252  057  0152  0027Mr
Regarding to a quantitative description of the disc scales we
have found that in the central regions of our clusters at medium
redshift R  200 kpc there is a population of large disc galaxies
that is absent in the Coma Cluster as collected in Table 3 Those
results may agree with an evolution hypothesis from this range
of redshift clusters to the present in the disc scales of the late
type galaxy population in clusters
We have performed statistical tests to check if the disc scales
in the NOT medium redshift cluster sample are signicantly dif-
ferent to disc scales at nearby galaxies in clusters or in eld
With that purpose we have run the Kolmogorov-Smirnov KS
test to the cumulative functions of the disc scales for the clusters
in NOT sample the Coma sample and the sample of isolated
galaxies from Graham 2001 We have selected only galaxies
in the same range of magnitudes These cumulative functions are
shown in Figure 10
The results of the test gives that the disc scale distribution of
Coma galaxies is statistically dierent from the disc scale distri-
bution of both our medium redshift clusters 981 signicance
and the eld galaxy sample 999 signicance However the
disc scales of the eld galaxy sample and our medium redshift
galaxy sample are not statistically dierent 869 signicance
The distributions for Coma and NOT sample intersects at
disc scales of 4 kpc At the view of Figure 10 it seems to be a
larger dierence between the distributions for disc sizes smaller
than 4 kpc We have performed a new Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
for galaxies with discs larger than 4 kpc in all samples The re-
sults show that none of the samples can be ensured to be statis-
tically dierent with 5495 signicance for the Coma Cluster
and NOT sample 2895 for the Coma Cluster and eld galaxy
sample and 2837 for the NOT sample and eld galaxy sample
If we consider in our analysis the galaxies classied visu-
ally as Spirals in Ascaso et al 2008 we nd similar results
The whole disc scale distributions for Coma and NOT clusters
are statistically dierent with a 9898 signicance while for
NOT clusters and the eld galaxy sample are not statistically
dierent 1941 signicance In addition by considering only
the galaxies with disc scales larger than 4 kpc in this subsam-
ple the disc scales distributions for NOT and Coma galaxy clus-
ters and NOT and eld galaxies are not statistically dierent
with 6655 and 2895 respectively This result reinforces the
dierence in the smaller disc scales distributions in local and
medium redshift clusters from a morphological point of view
As a conclusion Coma shows an excess of galaxies with
discs scales smaller than 4 kpc with respect to the eld galaxy
and NOT sample Field galaxies with large disc could have en-
tered in the cluster and suered interactions with the environ-
ment that have made the discs get shorter Aguerri et al 2005
Aguerri  Gonzalez-Garca 2009 Kormendy et al 2008 in the
last 25 Gyr This conclusion supports an scenario in which the
environment plays a crucial role in the galaxy evolution
5 Discussion and Conclusions
In this paper we have analyzed the structural properties of a
sample of galaxies placed in a ve clusters between 018  z 
025 The structural parameters derived from these quantitative
classication have shown us that the galaxies tted into one com-
ponent have a nearly univocally correspondence with the shape
parameter Red galaxies tted with one component have a shape
parameter between 2 and 4 while for the blue galaxies tted
with one component the shape parameter we obtain is around 1
This bi-modality has been already observed in previous works
Driver et al 2006 Bell 2008 showing a clear dierence in the
formation and evolution of this two types of galaxy population
Ascaso et al Bright galaxy population of ve medium redshift clusters II
Likewise we have looked into the relation of the structural
parameters We have looked into the Kormendy Relation and we
have found that the ES0 and the bulges of early Spirals seem to
be a continuous set of parameters Similar results are obtained
with magnitude and color in Figure 8 The results show that re
and n follow a correlation with the magnitude taking out the ob-
vious outlier for the early types and for the bulges of early spi-
rals suggesting a similar nature of this objects
On the other hand we have compared the bulge scales of
the galaxies in the sample with scale of the bulges of galaxies
in the Coma cluster Aguerri et al 2004 obtaining the same
range of values As far as the disc scales of the galaxies in our
medium redshift sample are concerned we have compared them
with the disc scales in a sample of galaxies in Coma studied
by Aguerri et al 2004 and the disc scales of a sample of lo-
cal eld galaxies studied by Graham 2001 We have consid-
ered the whole galaxy sample classied in two components fol-
lowing the procedure explained in 33 and also to make sure
that we were comparing spiral visually classied galaxies we
have taken the whole galaxy sample classied as Spiral galaxy
in Ascaso et al 2008 We have found in both cases that the
disc scales of the galaxies in our sample are slightly larger than
those in Coma cluster and statistically dierent Moreover the
distribution of disc scales for the NOT sample is not statistically
dierent to the disc scales for the local eld galaxies This result
indicates an evolution in the disc scales of the galaxies in clusters
at medium redshift from local clusters
Interestingly we have seen that the main dierence of the
distribution is concentrated on the small disc galaxies  4 kpc
Thus this fact shows a dierent behavior between small and
large disc galaxies indicating a dierent nature of these kind
of objects There is a large population of galaxies with h  4 kpc
in the Coma cluster not observed in the eld or in the medium
redshift clusters
One of the main concerns to the present work could be that
the compared galaxy clusters at z0 the Coma cluster and at
z025 our NOT sample are not statistical complete samples
It can be argued that the Coma cluster is not a representative
comparison due to its high mass and degree of evolution Thus
the dierent disc scales founded between the Coma cluster and
those at medium redshift could be due to the fact that we are
comparing clusters with very dierent properties We have tested
this assumption by splitting our clusters sample into two groups
according with their galaxy richness poor clusters Richness
Class RC 2 and rich clusters RC  2 The Coma cluster
has a richness class similar to our rich clusters sample at z025
RC2 We have found that for both samples their disc scale
length distributions are dierent from Coma and similar to the
eld one This is the same tendency that is observed for the
overall distribution Therefore the result does not depend on the
richness of the clusters
More work needs to be performed in the future to span both
cluster samples and determine the variance in the disc scale dis-
tribution in nearby and medium redshift clusters Nevertheless
this result indicates that there was a strong evolution in the ex-
ternal parts of the galaxies in clusters during the last 25 Gyr or
that Coma is in some way anomalous Mechanisms like galaxy
harassment with small timescales  1 Gyr can explain this evo-
lution
