ABSTRACT
The rapid decline in the number of strong Ly emitting galaxies at z  6 provides
evidence for neutral hydrogen in the IGM but is dicult to explain with plausible
models for reionization We demonstrate that the observed reduction in Ly ux from
galaxies at z  6 can be explained by evolution in the escape fraction of ionizing pho-
tons fesc We nd that the median observed drop in the fraction of galaxies showing
strong Ly emission as well as the observed evolution of the Ly luminosity function
both follow from a small increase in fesc of fesc  01 from fesc  06 at z  6 This
high escape fraction may be at odds with current constraints on the ionising photon
escape fraction which favor smaller values of fesc 
20 However models that invoke
a redshift evolution of fesc that is consistent with these constraints can suppress the
z  7 Ly ux to the observed level if they also include a small evolution in global
neutral fraction of xHI  02 Thus an evolving escape fraction of ionising photons
can be a plausible part of the explanation for evolution in the Ly emission of high
redshift galaxies More generally our analysis also shows that the drop in the Ly
fraction is quantitatively consistent with the observed evolution in the Ly luminosity

INTRODUCTION
Observations of Ly emitting galaxies are often interpreted
to indicate that the intergalactic medium IGM is more
opaque to Ly photons at z  6 than at lower redshifts In
particular while the Ly luminosity function of Ly selected
galaxies LAE remains constant at z  3  6 eg Hu et al
1998 Ouchi et al 2008 it is observed to drop rapidly at z 
6 Kashikawa et al 2006 Ouchi et al 2010 Clement et al
2012 Since their rest-frame UV luminosity functions do not
exhibit the same evolution Kashikawa et al 2006 this re-
duction in the Ly luminosity function at z  6 is likely
caused by a reduction in the observed Ly ux from these
galaxies Moreover the so-called Ly fraction  which de-
notes the fraction of galaxies selected via the drop-out tech-

tween z  3 and z  6 Stark et al 2010 2011 but then
drops at z  6 Fontana et al 2010 Pentericci et al 2011
Schenker et al 2012 Ono et al 2012 Caruana et al 2012
Treu et al 2012 Caruana et al 2013 Treu et al 2013
The observed reduction in Ly ux from galaxies at
z  6 is most readily explained by having additional in-
tervening neutral atomic hydrogen which is opaque to the
Ly ux but not to the non-ionizing UV-continuum This
additional neutral atomic hydrogen is likely present natu-
rally at z  6 when reionization has not been completed
Indeed it has been predicted that the end of reionization
should coincide with a reduction in the observed Ly ux
from galaxies eg Haiman  Spaans 1999
Reionization was likely an inhomogeneous process in
which fully ionized bubbles were seperated by neutral inter-
galactic gas Furlanetto et al 2004 McQuinn et al 2007a
2 Dijkstra et al
In this scenario the progress of reionization is regulated
by the growth of percolating HII bubbles The nal stages
of reionization are characterized by the presence of large
bubbles whose individual sizes exceeded tens of cMpc eg
Zahn et al 2011 The majority of the galaxies we can
detect with existing instruments preferentially resided in-
side large HII bubbles Their Ly photons would have
been able to travel a signicant distance before enter-
ing the neutral IGM and redshift out of the Ly reso-
nance due to the Hubble expansion which would facil-
itate their subsequent transmission through the neutral
IGM Miralda-Escude 1998 Cen et al 2005 McQuinn et al
2007b Mesinger  Furlanetto 2008
Because of this eect it is dicult to interpret the ob-
served reduction of Ly ux from galaxies at z  6 in
the context of inhomogeneous reionization models since the
imprint of the neutral IGM on the detectability of Ly
emission from galaxies is found to be subtle For exam-
ple Dijkstra et al 2011 showed that the observed drop
in the Ly fraction at z  6 requires a change in the vol-
ume averaged neutral fraction of hydrogen of xHI  05
also see Jensen et al 2013 but see Taylor  Lidz 2013 who
caution that the required change can be reduced when ef-
fects of galaxy sample variance are accounted for which
is consistent with earlier constraints on this quantity by
McQuinn et al 2007b and Mesinger  Furlanetto 2008
from modeling the Ly luminosity functions As was pointed
out by Dijkstra et al 2011 this required rapid evolution
of xHI  05 over such a short time is extreme1
To alleviate this tension Bolton  Haehnelt 2013 re-
cently showed that the required xHI may be reduced signif-
icantly by Lyman limit systems LLSs self-shielding clouds
with NHI  1017 cm2 whose number density may evolve
rapidly at the end of reionization although this rise is slowed
down when recombinations in the IGM are taken into ac-
count see Sobacchi  Mesinger in prep Similarly the opac-
ity of residual HI in the ionised IGM can increase by as
much as  30 between z  57 and z  65 Dijkstra et al
2007b Laursen et al 2011 However these models also pre-
dict that the IGM transmits low fraction of Ly photons
TIGM  01  03 This is lower than current observational
constraints on this quantity which is likely related the im-
pact of galactic winds on the Ly line shape emerging from
galaxies Dijkstra  Jeeson-Daniel 2013 In any case these
possibilities will need to be explored and quantied further
in future work
Ly emission is powered by recombination following
photoionization inside HII regions The Ly luminosity of
a galaxy L is therefore proportional to the total number
of ionizing photons that do not escape from galaxies ie
1 If the star formation rate is tied to the formation of dark matter
structures it is dicult to imagine that it can be faster than this
then it is limited by the growth of the collapsed mass Even when
one ignores recombinations in Lyman limit systems which slow
down the late stages of reionization eg Furlanetto  Mesinger
2008 Alvarez  Abel 2012 Sobacchi  Mesinger in prep and
when one assumes that the rapidly-growing exponential tail of
the mass function is driving the late stages of reionization then
one still gets a 50 change in xHI over z  1 eg see Fig 1
in Lidz et al 2007 Relaxing both of these extreme assumptions
slows down the evolution further
L  1  fesc Nion where fesc denotes the escape frac-
tion of ionizing photons Thus having fesc increase between
z  6 and z  7 will reduce the Ly luminosity of galaxies
as observed We expect this eect to be especially strong
when fesc is large For example the intrinsic Ly luminos-
ity L doubles when fesc  08  09 while there is little
impact when fesc  01  02
Modeling fesc and its redshift dependence from rst
principles requires properly resolving the multi-phase struc-
ture of the interstellar medium see eg Fernandez  Shull
2011 and the small spatial scales that are relevant for
the transport of ionising radiation in high density gas eg
Rahmati et al 2013 Direct observational constraints on
the escape fraction and its redshift dependence are still
highly uncertain However there are several lines of indi-
rect evidence that fesc increases with redshift Measure-
ments of the redshift dependence of the photoionization rate
of the Ly forest in combination with the observed red-
shift evolution of the UV-LF of drop-out galaxies suggest
that fesc increases quite rapidly with redshift at z 4 eg
Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere 2012 Mitra et al 2013 also see
Inoue et al 2006 Moreover the covering factor of low-
ionization absorbers in drop-out galaxies has been observed
to increase from z  3 to z  4 which provides independent
evidence that fesc is increasing with redshift Jones et al
2012 2013 This inferred redshift evolution could reect
eg i an evolution of the UV-emissivity per unit gas mass
ii an evolution in the clumpiness in the interstellar medium
ISM of high-z galaxies which aects the covering factor of
high-column density gas Fernandez  Shull 2011 andor
iii an evolution in the fraction of stars formed in low-mass
halos which can eciently self-ionize eg Ferrara  Loeb
The goal of this paper is to explore the impact of an
increasing escape fraction on the visibility of the Ly emis-
sion line from galaxies at z  6 We stress the purpose of
our paper is a proof-of-concept and that a systematic study
will be performed in future work The outline is as follows
we describe our model in  2 present our results in  3 We
discuss our results in  4 and present our conclusions in  5
2 THE MODEL
21 The EW-PDF and Its Redshift Evolution
The strength of the Ly line emerging from galaxies is reg-
ulated by several physical processes i The amount of Ly
that is produced which depends on the initial mass func-
tion stellar metallicity eg Schaerer 2003 and fesc ii
the amount of Ly that escapes from the dusty interstel-
lar medium of galaxies which is correlated with the dust-
content of galaxies Atek et al 2009 Kornei et al 2010
Hayes et al 2011 and iii the amount of Ly that is scat-
tered in the intergalacticcircum galactic medium The Ly
line strength relative to the non-ionizing UV continuum is
quantied by the rest frame equivalent width EW ie
EW L
LcUV  where LcUV denotes the luminosity den-
sity of the continuum at UV  1300  1600 A The Ly
emitting properties of a collection of galaxies can be quan-
tied by the cumulative EW-distribution function PDF
denoted with P EW
ccid13 2012 RAS MNRAS 000 19
The Redshift Evolution of fesc and the Ly Fraction
All processes listed above leave their imprint on the
observed EW-PDF and its redshift evolution In particu-
lar the EW-PDF evolves towards larger EWs from z  3
to z  6 Stark et al 2010 which can most easily be at-
tributed to a decreasing dust content of galaxies in this red-
shift range Hayes et al 2011 Moreover since the opacity
of the intergalactic medium is expected to increase over the
same redshift interval and which would thus reduce the
EW-PDF towards higher z its impact appears subdomi-
nant to that of dust However the average2 dust content
of galaxies keeps decreasing at z  6 eg Finkelstein et al
2012b Bouwens et al 2012b and we would expect the EW-
PDF to keep increasing This is not what has been observed
and it becomes natural to search for alternative explanations
for this sudden reduction in the EW-PDF at z  6 Suppres-
sion of the Ly line by neutral intergalactic gas is a natural
explanation as there exist other observational indications
for the presence of neutral intergalactic gas at z  6 eg
in quasar absorption line spectra see Wyithe  Loeb 2004
Mesinger  Haiman 2007 Bolton et al 2011
Previous models eg Dijkstra et al 2011 Jensen et al
2013 Bolton  Haehnelt 2013 have explored this possibil-
ity quantitatively and assumed that the EW-PDF at z  7
only diers from the one measured at z  6 due to the
intervening neutral IGM Under this assumption we have
EW7EW6  TIGM7TIGM6 where TIGMx corresponds to
the IGM transmission fraction at redshift z  x We can
then derive the EW-PDF at z  7 from the one observed
at z  6 simply from3 P7EW  P6EW  TIGM6TIGM7
Because it is dicult to explain the observed zevolution
with reionization alone see  1 we perform a similar anal-
ysis which includes a redshift escape fraction in this paper
as is discussed in more detail next
22 The Redshift Evolution of the EW-PDF with
fescz
To incorporate the impact of fesc we rst introduce the dis-
tribution P0EW which denotes the EW-PDF if the escape
fraction of ionizing photons at z  6 were fesc  0 This
model maximizes the produced Ly luminosityEW for a
given IMF and stellar metallicity We assume that P0EW
is an exponential function at EW 0 with a scalelength
EW0 zero otherwise We next assume that galaxies have a
distribution of fesc which we denote with4 pfesc In this
case we have
PxEW  Z P0EW1  fescpxfescdfesc
where pxfesc denotes the dierential distribution of fesc
and where PxEW denotes the cumulative distribution of
2 Of course individual galaxies at z  6 can be dusty see eg
Finkelstein et al 2013 for an example at z  75 with weak Ly
emission
3 Dijkstra et al 2011 computed TIGM-PDFs P7TIGM as
part of their analysis and this could also be folded into
the calculation Dijkstra et al 2011 further assumed that
TIGM6  1 Under these assumptions we have P7EW 
R dTIGM P7TIGMP6EWTIGM
4 We denote dierential and cumulative probability distributions
with lower and upper case letters respectively That is we denote
px  dP
ccid13 2012 RAS MNRAS 000 19
or expectation value of fesc with hfesci  R 1
EW at redshift z  x We assume that pxfesc is Gaussian
when 0 6 fesc 6 1 and zero otherwise We denote the mean
0 dfescfescpfesc
For a given pxfesc we constrain the scalelength EW0 by
comparing to the observed PxEW We point out that the
expression for PxEW in Eq 3 is a weighted sum of ex-
ponential functions with dierent scale-lengths The nal
function is therefore generally not an exponential function
which diers from previous analyses as in Dijkstra et al
2011 Jensen et al 2013 Bolton  Haehnelt 2013 In our
analysis we make the following additional assumptions
 fesc at a xed z is the same for all galaxies ie fesc does
not depend on MUV As discussed in  41 this assumption
is likely unrealistic However the precise MUV-dependence
of fesc is still poorly constrained Instead of including this
possible dependence in our models we opt to study sim-
pler models which can provide a baseline for more complex
future models that include this eect Moreover the range
of UV-luminosities of the galaxies we are modeling is still
limited and the impact of fesc depending on MUV does not
aect our main results
 First we assume that the EW-PDF at z  7 diers
only from the one at z  6 due to the a change in the
escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc see  21 for a mo-
tivation of this assumption We present our results on this
analysis in  3 We discuss how our analysis is modied if
we assume that the EW-PDF evolves at z  6 as a result
of a joint evolution in fescz and reionization in  23 We
generally present our results in terms of the expectation val-
ues hfesc7i  hfesc6i  hfesci 6 1 We point out that the
large impact on the redshift evolution in P EW for large
hfesc6i at xed hfesci as mentioned in  1 arises because
fesc appears as 1  fesc1 in the argument of P0EW in
Eq 3 which increases rapidly when fesc  1
 Our analysis implicitly assumes that the zevolution
of fesc does not aect the zevolution of other quantities
eg increasing the escape fraction does not increase i the
fraction of Ly photons that are transmitted through the
IGM or ii the fraction of Ly photons that can escape
from the dusty ISM of galaxies As we argue in  43 i is
reasonable while ii presents a limitation of the model but
may help explain why the redshift evolution of the escape
fraction may only have noticeable eects on the visibility of
the Ly line at z  6
23 The Redshift Evolution of the EW-PDF with
fescz and xHIz
If we add the eect of an modest evolution in reionization
together with a modest evolution in fesc then we can achieve
a larger drop in the Ly fraction The additional impact of
reionization on the EW-PDF can be incorporated as5

tion is conservative in the sense that it maximizes the impact of

example of a model in which the observed redshift evolution
of the Ly EW-PDF can be mimicked completely with a
redshift-dependent fescz

length of P0EW As we mentioned in  2 we use Eq 1 to com-

32 Evolution in the Luminosity Functions from
Redshift Evolution in fescz
We also show the impact of a changing fesc on the Ly lumi-
nosity function of LAEs For this exercise we follow the pro-
cedure of Dijkstra  Wyithe 2012 who constructed Ly
luminosity functions by combining observed UV luminosity
functions of drop-out selected galaxies with observed Ly
equivalent width distributions Dijkstra  Wyithe 2012
found that this procedure reproduces observed luminosity
functions of LAEs well following inclusion of a rescaling by
a factor of F  05 for a detailed discussion we refer the
interested reader Dijkstra  Wyithe 2012 Importantly the
redshift evolution of the luminosity functions of LAEs was
reproduced well at all redshifts z 3 which is important for
the analysis presented here
The dierential Ly luminosity function denoted by
d log L measures the comoving number density of
d log L
galaxies with the logarithm of their Ly luminosities in
the range log L  d log L2 and is given by
d log L
 F Z Mmax

Here MUVdMUV denotes the comoving number den-
sity of drop-out selected galaxies with absolute magnitudes
in the range MUV  dMUV2 for which we adopted the

F  05 as mentioned above Equation 3 therefore allows
us to compute the redshift evolution in the Ly luminosity

show the predicted luminosity functions at z  65 The

same as at z  6 while the dotted red line assumes that
fesc evolved from hfesci  065 at z  6 to hfesci  070 at

LAEs are detected only marginally in the continuum see Fig 22
of Ouchi et al 2008 A proper calculation would take into ac-
count that there are UV bright LAEs MUV   210 for which
P EW is dierent However because there are fewer of these
galaxies the impact of the assumed P EW at bright MUV only
has little impact on the bright end of the Ly luminosity function
We have repeated our analysis with the MUV-dependent P EW
given by Dijkstra  Wyithe 2012 and obtained practically the
same results

Figure 2 This Figure compares predicted Ly luminosity func-
tions to observations at z  57 blue lled circles taken from
Ouchi et al 2008 at 65 red lled squares taken from Ouchi
et al 2010 and z  70 green diamonds taken from Ota et al
2010 The black solid line represents our model at z  57 which
uses the z6 EW-PDF shown as the black solid in the left panel of
Figure 1 The blue and red dotted lines represent predicted lumi-
nosity functions at z  65 and z  70 when we assume the same
redshift evolution in fesc as in Figure 1 The blue and red dashed
lines assume no evolution in the Ly EW-PDFs see text This
Figure shows that the model that reproduced the observed drop
in the Ly fraction shown in Fig 1 also naturally reproduces
the observed evolution in the Ly luminosity functions of LAEs
The data at z  65 red lled squares taken from Ouchi
et al 2010 does not favor any of the models signicantly
The blue lines show the predicted luminosity functions at
z  70 where the dotted line shows a model in which the
fesc evolved to hfesc7i  075 at z  70 This model lies
much closer to the observations of Ota et al 2010 green
diamonds than the model which keeps fesc constant Thus
evolution in the escape fraction of ionizing photons simul-
taneously explains the observed drop in the Ly fraction
between z  6 and z  7 and the observed evolution in the
Ly luminosity functions within the same redshift range
More generally our analysis shows that the drop in the Ly
fraction is quantitatively consistent with the observed evo-
lution in the Ly luminosity functions of LAEs
33 Evolution in the Ly Fraction from Joint
Redshift Evolution in fescz and xHI
The previous section illustrated that a small evolution in
fesc from a value of hfesc6i  065 is sucient to explain
the observed decrease in the LAE luminosity function and
the fraction of strong Ly emitting galaxies However this
high escape fraction may be at odds with constraints ob-
tained from measurements of Thomson optical depth to the
cosmic microwave background the photoionization rate of
the Ly forest and the observed redshift evolution of the
UV-LF of drop-out galaxies which jointly favour values of
fesc6  10  20 Inoue et al 2006 Wyithe et al 2010
Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere 2012 Robertson et al 2013
Becker  Bolton 2013 also see Finkelstein et al 2012
6 Dijkstra et al
While these estimates rely on uncertain extrapolations9 of
the luminosity density in low luminosity galaxies and to-
wards higher redshifts the rst direct constraints on fesc
in LAEs have recently been reported by Ono et al 2010
who found fesc6 06 1  
Thus the escape fraction evolution is unlikely to fully
explain the observed drop in the Ly fractions We there-
fore examine the specic case in which fesc evolves as
fescz  f01  z5 as in Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere
2012 also see Becker  Bolton 2013 and adopt   4
and f0  004 which is consistent with observations see
Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere 201210 For f0  004 we have
fesc  015 at z  6 and fesc  026 at z  7 While this
model predicts that hfesci  01 it does not suce to fully
explain the observed evolution of the EW-PDF This is due
to the smaller value of hfesc6i than what we assumed pre-
viously which gives rise to a weaker impact on the redshift
evolution of the EW-PDF see  1 and  2
In Figure 3 we show the cumulative Ly EW distribu-
tion for UV-faint drop-out selected galaxies only see Fig 1
for a description of the lines and data points the following
results are quantitatively the same for the UV-bright galax-
ies The black solid line now represents a model in which

and ii P0EW  expEWEW0 where EW0  55 A
note that it was11 EW0  110 A in the model studied
in  3 for the UV-faint sample The red dotted lines show
the predicted changes in the EW-PDF under the assump-
tion that the drop is entirely due to a changing ionization
state of the IGM as in Dijkstra et al 2011 and Jensen
et al 201312 The upperlower red dotted line corresponds
to xHI  02xHI  05 The blue dashed line repre-
sents a model in which hfesci  011 in addition to having

tably the constraint fescz  7  20 includes all galaxies with
MUV  130 and thus involves extrapolating the UV-LF by 4-5
magnitudes
10 The evidence for such a dramatic evolution in fesc can be
ameliorated however with eg i a luminosity ie halo mass
dependence of fesc as in eg Ferrara  Loeb 2013 ii an evolv-
ing contribution of very faint dwarf galaxies andor iii a loos-
ening of the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich reionization constraints
used in the analysis for Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere 2012 which
Mesinger et al 2012 show are insensitive to the end stages of
reionization We return to the issue of i in the next section but
ii in particular is not surprising as pointed out by Alvarez et al
2012 A population of dwarf galaxies near the atomic cooling
threshold with moderate values of fesc could reionize the Uni-
verse at z  10 Photo-ionization feedback from reionization itself
would subsequently suppress star formation in galaxies around
this mass scale eg Sobacchi  Mesinger 2013 so that they no
longer contribute to the ionizing emissivity at z  4
11 We have to pick a dierent EW0 because we changed p6fesc
For the new choice for p6fesc the predicted EW-PDF P6EW
diers from that shown in Fig 1
12 It is worth noting that if the IGM is not fully neutral even
at z  6 which is consistent with current observations eg
McGreer et al 2011 Schroeder et al 2013 then the xHI re-
quired to match observations is decreased McQuinn et al 2007b
Mesinger  Furlanetto 2008 Dijkstra et al 2011
Figure 3 This Figure shows the cumulative Ly EW distri-
bution for UV-faint drop-out selected galaxies see Fig 1 for a
description of the lines and data points and the text for de-
tails on the models Here the upperlower red dotted line rep-
resents a model in which we modify the EW-PDF by having the
IGM opacity increase due to an increase in the globally aver-
aged neutral fraction xHI  017xHI  05 The dashed
blue lines represents a model in which in addition fesc evolves as
fescz  0041z54 in addition to having xHI  017 This
Figure shows that mild evolution in both xHI and fesc can mim-
ick a more rapid evolution in xHI and thus explain the observed
drop in Ly fractions The grey solid lines show predictions if
we extrapolated the redshift evolution of fesc to z  8 while
also changing the globally averaged neutral fraction to xHI  03
This prediction is still at odds with recently inferred fraction at
z  8 by Treu et al 2013 represented by the upper limit at
EW 25 A The models can be made more consistent with this
upper limit if we shift the predicted EW-PDFs by EW-25 A
shown by the grey dotted line see text
the model with xHI  05 and no evolution in fesc Thus
extrapolation of the observed evolution in fesc is equivalent
to having an additional xHI  03 between z  6 and z  7
in eecting the properties of Ly ux and EW
The grey solid line represents the a model in which the
redshift evolution in fesc is extrapolated to z  8 In this
model we additionally assume that the globally averaged
neutral fraction xHI has evolved further to xHI  03
Figure 3 shows that an evolving fescz has a dramatic
impact on the predicted Ly fraction at z  8 However
even these models do not reproduce the recently inferred
Ly fraction at z  8 by Treu et al 2013 represented
by the upper limit at EW 25 A This failure can be
partially remedied by requiring that xHI  03 at z  8
which would again require a very rapid evolution in xHI
It may also be related to the fact that our models assume
that all drop-out galaxies have a Ly emission line with
EW 0 ie that P0EW  0  1 While this assumption
is consistent with observations of drop-out galaxies at
z  6 the observational uncertainties allow us to relax
this assumption and shift the intrinsic distribution by say
EW25 A which would imply that P0EW  0  1 as
observed in z  3 drop-out galaxies Shapley et al 2003
While the escape fraction of Ly photons increases with
redshift it is unclear whether P0EW  0  1 at z  6
ccid13 2012 RAS MNRAS 000 19
The Redshift Evolution of fesc and the Ly Fraction
If we apply a shift of EW25 A to the predictions at
z  8 then our model predictions lie much closer to the
upper limit at z  8 as shown by the grey dotted line
4 DISCUSSION
41 A MassLuminosity-dependent fescz
A caveat is that the observationally inferred redshift evolu-
tion of fesc adopted in  33 refers to an average over the
entire galaxy population It has been argued that the in-
ferred redshift evolution may be driven by a mass andor
luminosity dependence of the escape fraction Alvarez et al
2012 Ferrara  Loeb 2013 In this scenario fesc decreases
towards higher masses andor luminosities and the popula-
tion averaged escape fraction reects the redshift evolution
of the luminosity andor mass functions Support for the
mass andor luminosity dependence of the escape fraction
is provided by the observationally inferred escape fraction
of LAEs at z  3 of fesc  01  03 which is signicantly
higher than the inferred fraction for the more massive LBGs
where fesc  005 eg Iwata et al 2009 Nestor et al 2011
This suggests that assuming a uniform fescz is not re-
alistic However the higher inferred escape fraction of LAEs
at z  3 of fescz  3  01  03 may imply that we need a
less rapid evolution in fescz to have a signicant impact on
the redshift evolution of the Ly fraction we showed that
hfesci  01 can either help explain the observed drop in
the Ly fraction between z  6 and z  7 if hfesc6i  015
or explain the complete evolution when hfesc6i  015 If
fescz increases continuously between z  3 and z  6
then hfesc6i may be large enough that only a small addi-
tional change may have a signicant impact As mentioned
in  1 the decreasing covering factor of low ionization ab-
sorption lines with redshift does suggest that escape frac-
tion increases with redshift for a xed galaxy population
Jones et al 2012 2013
42 Ly Transport  Escape and a Bimodal
pfesc
The observed Ly ux of a galaxy not only depends on
fesc but also on the eective escape fraction of Ly pho-
tons from the galaxies to the observer f e
escLy Thus we
have L  f e
escLy1  fesc The eective escape fraction
escLy includes the fraction of Ly photons that escape from
the interstellar medium of galaxies but also the fraction
that is subsequently transmitted through the intergalactic
medium IGM eg Dijkstra  Jeeson-Daniel 2013 Both
of these processes may depend on the value of fesc ie
escLy  f e
escLyfesc see discussion in  43
The escape of Ly photons from a dusty interstellar
medium for example is a complex process which depends
on the dust content of the ISM as well as its kinematics
eg Atek et al 2008 Hayes et al 2011 Irrespective of
these complexities the escape of ionizing photons requires
low column density NHI  1017 cm2 sightlines out
of the galaxy If these low HI-column density paths are
surrounded by higher column density sightlines which are
opaque to ionizing photons as in the blow-out model
ccid13 2012 RAS MNRAS 000 19
proposed by Nestor et al 2011 then we may expect Ly
photons to scatter and preferentially escape along these
same paths see Behrens et al 2014 for a more detailed
investigation of this eect This can introduce a correlation
between the escape fractions of Ly and ionizing photons
In the most extreme case individual galaxies would have
a bimodal distribution for pfesc which contains peaks at
fesc  0 and fesc  1 Interestingly there is observational
support for such a bimodality in observations of star
forming galaxies which indicate that a small fraction has
a large fesc while a large fraction practically has fesc  0
Shapley et al 2006 Nestor et al 2011 Vanzella et al
2012 However even in this scenario it is the escape
fraction averaged13 over all sightlines f 
esc that is relevant
for powering nebular emission and also for reionizing the
Universe The models described in this paper therefore also
describe a scenario in which f 
esc is distributed as a Gaussian
It is nevertheless good to keep in mind that our scenario
does not describe the more extreme situation in which f 
has a bimodal distribution ie it does not describe a sce-
nario in which some galaxies have fesc  0 while others have
fesc  0 in all directions In this scenario  which appears to
be at odds with observed covering factors of low-ionization
absorption line systems in drop-out galaxies which are typ-
ically  1 see eg Heckman et al 2011 Jones et al 2013
an increase in fescz with z translates to an increase in the
fraction of galaxies with fesc  0 This would also reduce
the fraction of star forming galaxies that produce Ly pho-
tons However the overall reduction in the number density
of LAEs would be weaker than in our models
43 Dependence of f e
escLy on fesc
The discussion above shows that the eective escape
fraction of Ly photons can depend on fesc and therefore
possibly on MUV as in Forero-Romero et al 2012 If
ionizing photons escape anisotropically then so do Ly
photons However the rst calculations of this eect have
been reported only recently Behrens et al 2014 The
precise correlation this may introduce between fesc and
escLy is complex it depends eg on the geometry of
the low-column density holes outow properties and
has therefore not been quantied yet If we assume for
simplicity that f e
esc then we expect the observed
Ly luminosity to increase with fesc until fescpk  y
after which it decreases
escLy  f y
The correlation between f e
escLy and fesc likely originates
mostly at the ISM-level subsequent resonant scattering in
the IGM occurs o residual HI whose number density is
aected by the value of fesc eg Haardt  Madau 2012
and Fig 4 of Dijkstra et al 2007a for how this aects
the IGM opacity However resonant scattering in the
IGM depends sensitively on the assumed Ly spectral
line prole Scattering o HI in galactic outows typically
13 In the extreme scenario in which fesc  1 along certain sight-
lines and fesc  0 otherwise the angle-averaged escape fraction
esc is just the sky-covering factor of low column density holes
ie f 
esc  hole4
8 Dijkstra et al
redshifts the Ly photons out of resonance as they escape
from the galaxy which strongly reduces the importance of
resonant scattering in the IGM see Fig 1 and the discussion
in  31 of Dijkstra et al 2011 Ignoring the dependence of
the IGM transmission on fesc is therefore reasonable
In short ignoring a plausible correlation between f e
and fesc is a shortcoming of the model that will need to
be addressed in future work Interestingly it may help us
explain why a monotonously evolving fesc can give rise to
a non-monotonic redshift dependence of the Ly fraction
with a turn-over occuring near the redshifts of interest
For example If fescz  3  1 consistent with up-
per limits by Vanzella et a 2010 and fescz  6  15
as in Kuhlen  Faucher-Giguere 2012 then the inferred
escLy from Dijkstra  Jeeson-Daniel 2013 and Hayes et
al 2011 implies that y  03  05 which corresponds to
fescpk  02  03 We would have a peak in Ly luminosity
near the fesc and redshift of interest
5 CONCLUSION
We have investigated whether the observed reduction in Ly
ux from galaxies at z  6 can be explained by an evolving
escape fraction of ionizing photons fesc Our study was mo-
tivated by i a growing consensus in the literature that fesc
must have been higher at high redshift and ii the fact that
it appears dicult to explain the observed reduction in Ly
ux with reionization alone We found that we can repro-
duce the median observed drop in the Ly fraction as well
as the observed evolution of the LAE luminosity functions
with a small increase in fesc of fesc 01 as long as the
escape fraction is large fesc  065 at z  6 Models with
redshift evolution of fesc that are more consistent with in-
direct constraints derived from observations combined with
a small evolution in global neutral fraction of xHI  02
between z  7  6 also suppress the z  7 Ly ux at at the
observed level Our study demonstrates that an evolving es-
cape fraction of ionising photons from galaxies modies the
observed equivalent widths of Ly galaxies at a level com-
parable to that expected from reionization and provides a
plausible part of the explanation for evolution in the Ly
emission of high redshift galaxies
Finally we expect the Ly spectral line shape to evolve
with redshift in models that invoke the IGM to explain the
reduced Ly ux from z  6 galaxies see Fig 5 of Dijkstra
et al 2007 while this is not obviously the case for models
that invoke evolution of fesc Interestingly Hu et al 2010
have shown that the observed Ly line shape of a stack of
z  65 galaxies is practically identical to that at z  57
We will investigate the implications of this result in future
