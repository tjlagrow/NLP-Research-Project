GALAXY AND STAR FORMATION UP TO Z 1
F Hammer and H Flores 1
Abstract
Star formation history shows a gradual decline since the last 8-9 Gyr z1
The bulk of present-day stellar mass and metal content was formed at red-
shifts lower than 2-3 which is consistent with a hierarchical scenario of
galaxy formation Observations of galaxy evolution during the last 23 of
the Universe age could be done in great details and provide numerous in-
sights on the origin of the Hubble diagram To some extent the evolution
and formation of present-day elliptical and spiral galaxies could be related to
the most rapidly evolving galaxy populations at z 1 namely the luminous
IR galaxies and the luminous compact galaxies
Introduction
Analysis of the age-metallicity relation in the solar neigborhood by Twarog 1980
indicated higher star formation rates in the past by factor 2-3 when the disk was
from 13 to 12 of its present age Hubble Space Telescope studies of Local Group
dwarves have revealed a surprisingly large variety of evolutionary histories see eg
Grebel 2000 Rapid technological developments in the last decade have opened
a new era for galaxy evolution studies galaxies can be detected at the earliest
epochs of the Universe and their evolution can be directly compared in dierent
redshift slices Combination of nearby and distant Universe studies is likely the
best way to understand how and when stars and metal content were formed in
the Universe
The Canada France Redshift Survey CFRS Lilly et al 1995 have probed
the evolution of luminous L galaxies up to z 1 The fraction of star form-
ing galaxies rapidly increases with the redshift more than 50 at z05 have
W0OII 15A Hammer et al 1997 which should be compared to 13 locally
Zucca et al 1998 This observed trend is followed by a variation of the average
rest-frame U V AB color from 16 Sab color at z0 to 13 Sbc color at z05
and 07 Sdm-Irr color at z1

2 Star formation history up to z1
The increase in star formation with redshift has been quantitatively estimated by
Lilly et al 1996 from the rest frame 2800A luminosity whose comoving density
evolves as rapidly as 1  z39075 This value is provided after assuming a
constant slope of the galaxy luminosity function GLF in the 0 1 redshift range
This evolutionary change has been interpreted as due to a large decrease of the
star formation by a factor 10 from z1 to z0 Madau et al 1996 This factor
could be revised downward to  4 as found by Cowie et al 1999 a large part of
the discrepancy being related to uncertainties on the local SFR density value
However optical studies of rest-frame UV light from distant galaxies do not
tell us all the story A large fraction of the UV luminosity could be absorbed by
dust and then reemitted in the far IR The eect is particularly signicant for
the luminous IR galaxies which dominate the upper end of the bolometric GLF
Using CFRS data Hammer and Flores 1998 have shown that UV and OII3727
luminosities are not correlating with H luminosities while they correlate well
together This suggests that extinction is a major source of uncertainty for deter-
mining the star formation history
From a CFRS follow-up study with ISOCAM and VLA Flores et al 1999
have provided the rst estimate of the SFR density at z 1 which was missed by
optical measurements because of dust They conclude that 4 of the eld galaxies
at z 1 are strong and heavily extincted starbursts with SFR from 50 to 200
Myr1 This sparse population is responsible for almost a third of the global
star formation density at z  1 Assuming a non evolved IR GLF the resulting
global star formation density is 205 times higher than derivations from UV
measurements Figure 1 The SFR density increases by a factor ranging from 5
to 10 from the present epoch to z1 The uncertainties related to that study are
coming from 1 those related to local values 2 the ambiguity about the source
of IR emission in some luminous galaxies Seyfert2 3 a possible evolution of
the GLF lower end and 4 a possible evolution of the IMF The observed SFR
density decline since z1 is mostly due to two rapidly evolving populations Figure
2 namely the luminous IR galaxies LIRGs Flores et al 1999 and the luminous
compact galaxies LCGs Guzman et al 1997 LIRGs are large and relatively
massive starbursts often found in interacting systems LCGs are an emerging
galaxy population at z 05 representing  30 of the galaxy population while
they have very few counterparts in the local Universe
3 Testing scenarii of galaxy formation
A simple integration of the global star formation leads to the formation of half of
the present-day stars since z1-15 Flores et al 1999 Madau et al 2001 Frances-
chini et al 2001 At z 3 less than a third of the present-day metal content was
formed even accounting for large dust corrections scenario of a constant star for-
mation density beyond z1 This favors a scenario in which the bulk of the metal
content in the Universe is formed at relatively recent epochs z 2 supporting
Galaxy and star formation up to z 1
Fig 1 Observed metal production and star formation densities at dierent look-back
times from Hammer 2000 SFR estimates are assuming a Salpeter IMF from 01
M to 100 M Flores et al points lled circles labeled ISO-VLA-CFRS show a global
SFR density contribution of both UV and IR photons two times higher than the values
previously derived from UV open circles Highest z estimates at rest-frame UV are from
Connolly et al 1997 and from Madau et al 1996 HDF open squares and have not
been corrected for extinction Estimates from H  luminosities stars are from Gallego
et al 1995 UCM Gronwall 1998 KISS and also from few galaxies at z 125 Yan
et al 1999 NICMOS
a hierarchical scenario ie that massive galaxies are gradually built up through
the coalescence of smaller building blocks The above considerations could chal-
lenge the assumption that all massive galaxies were formed through a primordial
collapse at the earliest epochs z 3 because most of the metal are locked into
massive bulges Fukugita et al 1998
When massive ellipticals ES0 have been formed  Bernadi et al 1998 found
a tight color- relation for a sample of early-type galaxies in the eld as well as in
galaxy clusters Such a tightness demands a high degree of synchronicity in their
star formation histories that is naturally accounted for by pushing back to early
times z 2 most of their star formation Bower et al 1992 Renzini 1999 A
large fraction of massive ellipticals lie in clusters or in groups and having most of
their star formation at high redshifts could be accomodated in hierarchical models
because clusters form out of the highest peaks in the primordial density uctu-
ations Kaumann and Charlot 1996 However in low density environments
the model predicts much recent epochs for their star formation including through

which reveal the important absorption line system and strong emission lines In the Right

A F and G stars dot-dashed line Gruel et al in preparation
mergers of dissipative gas rich disk galaxies It has been suggested that ellipticals
could be shared in two classes one class comprising low to moderate mass and
luminosity lenticulars and ellipticals the other the most massive ellipticals often
found in groups or clusters Faber et al 1997 Both classes occupy dierent part
of the fundamental plane and might have dierent star formation history Genzel
et al 2001 have suggested that ultra-luminous IR galaxies ULIRG which are
found in merging systems are progenitors of the less massive ellipticals At least
20 of ellipticals could be formed during such events since z1 according to the
number density of colliding giant disks detected by ISO eg Hammer 2000
Another constraint to the epoch of eld ES0 formation is provided by their num-
ber density 8-9 Gyr ago z 1 it is comparable to that found locally Schade et
al 1999 but the result is limited by small number statistics Moreover about
30 of morphologically selected ellipticals show signs of star formation revealed
by their colors and emission lines and could not be considered as non-evolved
ellipticals as those seen today From a recent study of 145 ES0 at z 1 Im et al
2001 rule out that more than 50 of the ellipticals can be formed since z 1
Present-day observations then suggest that from 20 to 50 of ellipticals mostly
the less massive ones were forming the bulk of their stars at recent epochs z
1 What is the star formation history of disk galaxies  Modelling of the Milky
Way see Boissier and Prantzos 1999 as well as the Schmitt law for disks Buat
1992 Kennicutt 1998 argue in favor of a rather long duration 3-7 Gyr for the
formation of the bulk of their stars The density of large disks rdisk  32h1

is found to be the same at z075 than locally Lilly et al 1998 Having most
the disks already in place at z 1 is also supported by the apparent non-evolution
of the Tully Fischer relation as reported by Vogt et al 1998 Above studies are
however limited either by model assumptions  Boissier and Prantzos model as-
sumes no galaxy interaction or by small number statistics Lilly et al and Vogt
et al studies or by a somewhat unadapted observational set-up slits not aligned
to the galaxy major axis in the Vogt et al study
Clues for a high redshift formation of disks -and then a gradual disk formation
during the last 8 Gyr- have been derived on the sole basis of optical observations
Conversely to that IR observations reveal that a noticeable fraction of disks show
recent and rapid evolutions probably because of galaxy interactions Deep mid-IR
counts show a strong evolution Elbaz et al 1999 mostly related to z 12 disks
often found in interacting systems About 30 of the large disks at z05-1 are IR
luminous and experience strong episods of star formation at rates of several tens
Galaxy and star formation up to z 1
of solar mass per year exceeding by far estimates from rest-frame UV light It is
still unknown what is the fraction of z 1 disks which are disrupted during merging
events Galaxy interactions and extinction related eects could also severely aect
dynamical measurements such those from the Vogt et al 1997 study
How spiral galaxies were forming  What they look like during their early
stages of formation  Hammer et al 2001 have suggested that luminous com-
pact galaxies LCGs were indeed progenitors of disks comparable or smaller to
the Milky Way LCG spectra Figure 2 reveals strong metallic absorption lines
combined with intense emission lines their main stellar population are evolved
stars with metal abundances comparable to those of Milky Ways bulge although
they are sites of intense star formations In the Hammer et al s interpretation
star formation was rstly occuring in bulges through merging of smaller entities
often revealed by deep HST imagery while faint surrounding extends of LCGs
correspond to low surface brightness disks LCGs are very enigmatic objects and
understanding their nature needs more investigations their sizes are similar to
those of local dwarves although they are up to one hundred times more luminous
than dwarves Their kinematics from optical emission lines revealed low veloci-
ties suggesting low masses comparable to those of present day dwarves Koo et al
1995 Guzman et al 1997 although merging and large extinctions could severely
aect the interpretation
4 Conclusion
Strong events of star formation and important changes in the galaxy populations
were occuring during the last 8-9 Gyr Current or soon-coming instrumentation
can provide details studies of z1 galaxy properties aiming at rmly establish the
origin of the Hubble diagram Several progresses are required to understand how
galaxies were formed and to recover the universal star formation history including
this is not an exhaustive list
 an accurate estimate of the universal stellar mass density and its evolution
from either galaxy dynamics measurements andor a better calibration of
stellar mass from near-IR luminosity measurements
 dynamical studies of a large number of merging systems in the past Universe
to investigate the nature of their by-products
 multi-wavelength analyses of star formation at all redshifts which accurately
account for dust-enshrouded star formation events
 proper measurements of gas dynamics in violent events of star formation
from measurements at far-IR rest-frame wavelengths andor a careful ac-
count of the selection eects related to extinction in optical measurements
 a better understanding of how stars are forming in a primordial medium as
well as improvements in modelling low metallicity stellar populations
SF2A 2001
 accurate stellar mass functions in various environments including in low
abundance medium in powerful starbursts and in massive bulges
 a better knowledge of the Type II AGN energy output because they signif-
icantly contribute to the upper end of the bolometric GLF
Several of the above challenges require signicant progresses related to the stellar
physics VLT has a major role to play especially with its soon-coming instrumen-
tation Velocity elds of galaxies -including those in interaction- will be provided
by GIRAFFE with its 3D spectroscopic mode and at intermediate resolution R
5000 v  30 kms At the focus of an 8 meter telescope and from its large
multiplex GIRAFFE will be unique for investigations of the low abundance stel-
lar properties by observing a large number of stars up to the Magellanic Cloud
and further away Star formation histories of Local Group galaxies will be care-
fully analysed by measuring the metal abundance of their giant stars Deepest
spectroscopic surveys by VIMOS will provide invaluable insights of the GLF well
below L up to z1 After its launching SIRTF will be unique for determining the
IR luminosity function up to large redshifts z2-3 and then will rmly estab-
lish the fraction of star formation occuring in very dusty environments Further
important progresses are also expected during the next decade At sub-mm wave-
lengths ALMA will be able to detect the earliest events of dust-enshrouded star
formation because at high redshift the 100 m thermal peak progressively enters
the sub-mm window which almost compensates the cosmological dimming It will
also provide accurate measurements of the gas dynamics at sub-arcsecond scales
independently of extinction eects At near-IR the NGST will fully investigate
the optical emission properties of highly redshifted galaxies Further progresses
are however needed for improving the spatial resolution because 1kpc at z 07
represents 01 twice the resolution the NGST diraction limit of a 65m at
22m Development of adaptive optics from the ground including from multi-
conjugate analyses is a very promising way and could generate instruments for the
2nd generation at VLT For example FALCON could complement the NGST by
studying velocity elds in distant starbursts Such developments are a prerequisite
for the next generation of extremely large telescopes ELTs with diameters  20
meters From their large collecting areas and their image quality assumed to be
restored near their diraction limits ELTs such as NG-CFHT CELT or OWL
would allow a new giant step in our understanding of the distant Universe
