Abstract 
The Tribolium genome contains 21 nuclear receptors representing all of the six known 
subfamilies When compared to other species this first complete set for a Coleoptera reveals a 
strong conservation of the number and identity of nuclear receptors in holometabolous 
insects Two novelties are observed the atypical NR0 gene knirps is present only in 
brachyceran flies while the NR2E6 gene is found only in Tribolium and in Apis Using a 
quantitative analysis of the evolutionary rate we discovered that nuclear receptors could be 
divided into two groups In one group of 13 proteins the rates follow the trend of the 
Mecopterida genome-wide acceleration In a second group of five nuclear receptors all acting 
together at the top of the ecdysone cascade we observed an overacceleration of the 
evolutionary rate during the early divergence of Mecopterida We thus extended our analysis 
to the twelve classic ecdysone transcriptional regulators and found that six of them ECR 
USP HR3 E75 HR4 and Kr-h1 underwent an overacceleration at the base of the 
Mecopterida lineage By contrast E74 E93 BR HR39 FTZ-F1 and E78 do not show this 
divergence We suggest that coevolution occurred within a network of regulators that control 
the ecdysone cascade The advent of Tribolium as a powerful model should allow a better 
understanding of this evolution

1 Introduction 
The recent burst of hexapods genome projects has already provided two novel and 
major results concerning the evolution of holometabolous insects Savard et al 2006a 
Savard et al 2006b Zdobnov and Bork 2007 First contrary to the most widely accepted 
hypothesis Hymenoptera are basal to the other main holometabolous orders Coleoptera 
Diptera and Lepidoptera Previous phylogenies obtained with morphological and molecular 
markers rRNA mitochondrial DNA were favouring a sister-group relationship between 
Hymenoptera and Mecopterida DipteraLepidoptera with Coleoptera as the basal group 
Kristensen 1999 Whitting 2002 The new tree is fully resolved for these four large orders 
85 of hexapods species although it lacks genomic data for seven smaller 
holometabolous orders In that perspective sequencing efforts for the Neuropterida 
superorder and for the enigmatic Strepsiptera would be highly valuable The second important 
result is an acceleration of protein evolution in Mecopterida Such an episodic change of rate 
had already been characterized for some genes in Diptera Friedrich and Tautz 1997 but the 
recent results show that this acceleration affected the whole genome of both Diptera and 
Lepidoptera Savard et al 2006b Zdobnov and Bork 2007 Therefore we can assume that 
an important evolutionary transition established a clear separation within holometabolous 
insects between the monophyletic superorder Mecopterida and the non-Mecopterida species 
This is very intriguing because this molecular divergence is not obviously correlated with any 
major phenotypic change The only morphological synapomorphies for Mecopterida are for 
example presenceabsence of some specific muscles in adults or larvae Kristensen 1981 
Whiting 1998 A question is thus raised what were the consequences of this acceleration for 
the developmental gene regulatory networks Given the numerous interactions existing 
between proteins that control development it is currently unclear how important functions 
can be maintained when their determining genetic elements are changing Solving this issue 
180608 
requests to identify which part of a given network can change and how the different partners 
can coevolve In view of the renewed landscape of holometabolous insects phylogenomics 
the Mecopterida acceleration appears as a case study to tackle these questions of the 
robustness and the adaptability of developmental regulatory networks during lineage specific 
events 
The regulatory networks that control the development of insects are largely composed 
of transcription factors and signalling proteins Remarkably one family of transcription 
factors the nuclear receptors can bypass the relatively slow and complex intracellular 
signalisation pathways The transcriptional activity of these proteins usually depends on the 
binding of specific ligands to their ligand-binding domain In animals nuclear receptors are 
the only transcription factors with the aryl hydrocarbon receptors that are directly activated 
by small lipophilic ligands hormones fatty acids gas capable of going through the cell 
membrane Nuclear receptors provide the organism with essential tools to respond rapidly at 
the gene expression level to environmental cues The availability of the ligand coordinates in 
time and space the activity of these powerful gene regulators They are thus involved in many 
physiological and developmental processes and as a consequence they are major targets of 
endocrine disruptors that are released in the environment by human activities Henley and 
Korach 2006 In insects their role has been well characterised in various developmental 
processes such as embryo segmentation moulting metamorphosis and eye morphogenesis 
King-Jones and Thummel 2005 They are very promising targets for the control of insect 
pests Palli et al 2005 Interestingly most nuclear receptors act as protein dimers and many 
of them can interact with each other in heterodimeric partnership thus forming regulatory 
networks The ecdysone regulatory cascade that controls metamorphosis in Drosophila where 
9 out of 18 nuclear receptors are involved best illustrates these crosstalks 
180608 
Thanks to the sequencing of the Tribolium genome by the Baylor Human Genome 
Sequencing Center we were able to identify the first complete set of nuclear receptors for a 
Coleopteran insect This provides the opportunity for a phylogenetic analysis of these proteins 
encompassing the four major groups of holometabolous insects Since we have described 
earlier the acceleration of the ecdysone receptor ECR-USP in Mecopterida Bonneton et al 
2003 Bonneton et al 2006 we ask here whether the other nuclear receptors acting in the 
ecdysone cascade were affected similarly Our analysis suggests how the different partners of 
an essential developmental regulatory network can coevolve through a lineage specific 
acceleration 
2 Materials and methods 
21 Annotation and phylogenetic analysis of Nuclear Receptors 
We used the nuclear receptors sets of Drosophila melanogaster and Apis mellifera 
Velarde et al 2006 to query the Tribolium castaneum genome version 20 The same 
approach was used against Genbank in order to recover all the nuclear receptors protein 
sequences from the six other insects species whose genome was available Fig 1 When a 
nuclear receptor was missing or was too short for one species nucleic acid sequences were 
retrieved and analysed with two gene prediction programs Augustus Stanke et al 2006 and 
Genescan Burge and Karlin 1997 When different isoforms were recovered only the 
longest one including a DBD and a LBD was chosen for analysis Predicted protein-coding 
sequences were aligned using SEAVIEW Galtier et al 1996 and manual corrections were 
made when possible following the phylogenetic trees and by the structural data FCP web 
180608 
tool Garcia-Serna et al 2006 All the Tribolium castaneum nuclear receptors genes could 
easily be identified table 1 Note that this task was facilitated by the fact that TLL EG ECR 
and USP had been cloned prior to the sequencing of Tribolium genome Schrder et al 2000 
Bucher et al 2005 Iwema et al submitted By contrast only 17 nuclear receptors were 
identified for Bombyx among which only 12 are long enough to be included into the analysis 
The vertebrates sequences mainly retrieved from NuReBase were used as outgroup Ruau et 
al 2004 Phylogenetic reconstruction was made with the BIONJ algorithm Gascuel 1997 
an improvement of the Neighbor Joining method Saitou and Nei 1987 with Poisson 
correction for multiple substitutions or with the maximum parsimony method as 
implemented in PhyloWin Galtier et al 1996 All positions with gaps were excluded from 
analyses 
22 Quantitative analysis of nuclear receptors evolution 
We aligned all the available protein sequences of arthropods independently for each of 
the 18 nuclear receptors that possess a LBD and that are found in all insects This excludes 
NR2E6 found only in Apis and Tribolium and the proteins of the NR0 subfamily which do 
not possess a LBD The same procedure was applied for four other transcription factors E74 
BR Kr-h1 and E93 involved in the control of the ecdysone pathway Fig 5 Alignments 
were automatically performed using ClustalW Thompson et al 1994 with manual 
correction in Seaview Galtier et al 1996 After removing of partial uninformative 
sequences we considered only the sequences from holometabolous insects All positions with 
gaps and misaligned regions were removed resulting in alignments of protein regions mostly 
encompassed in the DBD and LBD domains Only four species allowed to recover a good set 
of alignments allowing the comparison between all the 18 nuclear receptors Drosophila 
180608 
melanogaster Aedes aegypti Tribolium castaneum and Apis mellifera One exception is 
HR83 for which we had to use the sequence of the closely related mosquito Anopheles 
gambiae instead of the short sequence 85 amino-acids of DBD identified from Aedes 
aegypti genome We performed supplementary analysis with a set of five species adding the 
sequences of Bombyx mori available for 12 of the 18 nuclear receptors 
The pattern of evolution of each nuclear receptor was determined by the calculation of 
the branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree gathering the four or five species using a predefined 
unrooted topology Fig 4C Supp Fig 2C Branch lengths were estimated with maximum 
likelihood methods using the PAML program Yang 1997 Likelihood calculations were 
performed under the JTT amino acid substitution model Jones et al 1992 plus rate 
heterogeneity between sites estimated by a discrete gamma law with six categories with the 
shape parameter as an additional free parameter In order to check whether the estimation of 
the distances with a small number of species was robust enough and avoid a possible 
taxonomic bias we constructed trees including all the arthropods sequences available for each 
protein Then we extracted the subtrees corresponding to the four or five species of 
reference The comparison of the distances obtained with both sets of species revealed a very 
good linear correlation R2  098 p-value  10-15 with values closed to the equality slope of 
the linear regression comprised between 09 and 1 for a linear model with a null intercept 
We adopted an approach used in morphometric analysis to compare in a quantitative 
manner the evolution of the nuclear receptors during the radiation of holometabolous insects 
Using either the set of 18 trees established with four species or the set of 12 trees with five 
species we performed principal component analysis PCA to compare the patterns of 
evolution of the different nuclear receptors The unrooted tree computed for each nuclear 
receptor was then considered as an  individual  that could be described by as many 
180608 
variables as branches 5 variables for four species and seven variables for five species We 
performed non-normed PCA using the package ade4 Chessel et al 2004 of the R software 
R Development Core Team 2006 We displayed factorial maps Fig 4AB by means of the 
biplot procedure which allows visualising simultaneously the distribution of individuals and 
the correlation between variables and principal axes Chessel et al 2004 
In order to discriminate groups of proteins with similar patterns of evolution we 
performed hierarchical clustering analysis based on factorial coordinates following four 
distinct agglomeration methods Wards method complete single and average linkage 
method as implemented in the package stat of the R software R Development Core Team 
2006 Bold branches on figure 4D and supplemental figure 2D underline the clusters which 
are found with all the four different hierarchical methods 
To compare the patterns of evolution observed for nuclear receptors with the global 
genomic trend during holometabolous radiation insect phylogenomic trees from the literature 
estimated with 64134 aa Savard et al 2006a 705502 aa or 336069 aa Zdobnov and Bork 
2007 were projected on the factorial maps established with trees computed for nuclear 
receptors Fig 4 
In addition the same PCA procedure as in figure 4 was performed only with the 
phylogenetic trees of eight nuclear receptors ECR USP E75 HR3 HR4 E78 HR39 and 
FTZ-F1 plus four other transcription factors E74 Kr-h1 E93 and BR forming a sample of 
twelve genes involved in the control of the ecdysone pathway King-Jones and Thummel 
2005 For this analysis Fig 5 we did not comprise the length of the Drosophila branch 
among the variables of the PCA because of an atypical strong divergence of the Drosophila 
protein E93 Indeed this long branch in the tree of E93 conceals the pattern observed if we 
exclude E93 from the analysis Conversely the reported PCA Fig 5 yields factorial maps 
closed to the scatter diagrams obtained without E93 and moreover the pattern disclosed on 
180608 
these diagrams is not affected whether we do not include the Drosophila branch in the 
variables of the PCA taking into account only the eleven remaining proteins data not shown 
3 Results 
31 The genome of Tribolium castaneum contains 21 nuclear receptors 
Thanks to the conserved DBD and LBD domains all the Tribolium castaneum nuclear 
receptors genes could be identified by blast searches on the available gene predictions 
GLEAN Genbank The Tribolium genome contains 19 typical nuclear receptors 
representing all of the six subfamilies described so far An additional subset of two nuclear 
receptors lacking a LBD subfamily NR0 group A is also present table 1  Fig 1 Overall 
as expected the DBDs show high conservation 76-99 while the LBDs are more divergent 
26-94 when compared to the Drosophila orthologs The most divergent nuclear receptor is 
the insects specific HR83 NR2E5 of unknown function while the most conserved is SVP 
NR2F3 the ortholog of COUP-TF an orphan receptor essential for metazoan development 
Unlike the Hox genes which are clustered on one single complex we could map 18 nuclear 
receptors genes on seven of the ten linkage groups of Tribolium table 1 
The identification of Tribolium nuclear receptors reveals the first complete set for a 
Coleoptera It is therefore now possible to compare this family of proteins between all the 
major orders of holometabolous insects 
32 Comparative analysis of nuclear receptors in insects 
180608 
The set of 21 Tribolium nuclear receptors is very close to the set of other insects 
which range from 20 in Aedes aegypti to 22 in honeybee Fig 1 The novelties are restricted 
to two genes which are present in some groups of species and not in others 
First the gap gene knirps is found only in brachyceran flies Drosophila and Musca 
domestica but not in mosquitoes or any other holometabolous insect fig 1 fig 2A All 
species studied so far including Tribolium and Apis possess at least two NR0 genes 
suggesting that the duplication which produced eagle and knirps-like arose early during 
insect evolution After duplication knirps diverged rapidly from its paralog which is 
probably knirps-like as suggested by the chromosomal positions and the strong conservation 
of function during development between these two genes Rothe et al 1992 Lunde et al 
2003 All the atypical NR0 genes are located on a single chromosome in the genome of 
Tribolium LG3 Drosophila 3L 77CE-78E and Anopheles 3L 38B supplementary 
table 
By contrast the NR2E6 gene was specifically lost in Diptera and maybe in 
Lepidoptera as well This gene has no vertebrate homolog and it has been identified only in 
Tribolium and in Apis with 67 of overall similarity between the proteins of these two 
species 97 for the DBD only The NR2E group contains several insect specific nuclear 
receptor such as dissatisfaction and HR83 together with genes that share clear homologs 
with vertebrates such as tailless and HR51PNR NR2E3 The phylogenetic analysis of this 
group shows that NR2E6 is a new insects specific nuclear receptor of the NR2E subgroup 
that is not significantly related to NR2E3 Fig 2B In Tribolium HR51 NR2E3 is located 
on the linkage group 7 while NR2E6 is on the LG5 Therefore we suggest using the 
nomenclature-based name NR2E6 for this gene rather than the trivial name PNR-like which 
were both proposed previously by Velarde et al 2006 
180608 
Since both ECR and USP experienced a strong acceleration of evolutionary rate in 
Mecopterida Bonneton et al 2006 we looked whether a similar trend could be observed for 
other nuclear receptors As a first step for this test we performed a simple phylogenetic 
analysis with each of the 18 nuclear receptors that possess a LBD and that are found in all 
insects This excludes NR2E6 and the proteins of the NR0 subfamily It is not our aim to 
provide here a full phylogeny of the whole family but rather to use the trees to detect possible 
accelerations Bonneton et al 2003 If we consider only the proteins with orthologs 
available at least in Diptera Lepidoptera Coleoptera and Hymenoptera the results reveal 
two kinds of topologies either a well supported divergence of the Mecopterida 
DipteraLepidoptera branch or not table 2 On the first group we find E75 HR3 ECR 
USP HR78 and HR4 The DBD sequences are highly conserved Supp Fig 1 while the 
Mecopterida specific differences are scattered along the LBD domain which show low 
identity percentage table 1 As an example the figure 3 shows an unrooted tree of NR1D 
and NR1F proteins which correspond to respectively E75REV-ERB and HR3ROR Note 
that in contradiction with the known phylogeny Tribolium sequences are grouped with Apis 
and other non-Mecopterida orthologs This aberrant topology is due to a long branch 
attraction because of the acceleration of evolutionary rate in the Mecopterida lineage Similar 
results were already described for ECR and USP Bonneton et al 2003 By contrast HNF4 
TLL SVP HR38 FTZ-F1 and HR39 have a much more conserved LBD sequence table 1 
and their respective tree do not show a significantly supported Mecopterida branch table 2 
see also figure 2B for an example of such a tree with TLL 
In conclusion the main event that occurred during the evolution of nuclear receptors 
in holometabolous insects is probably the strong acceleration of some of its members in the 
Mecopterida lineage In order to characterize further this spectacular divergence we decided 
to perform a quantitative and comparative analysis of the rates of divergence 
180608 
33 Overacceleration among nuclear receptors in Mecopterida 
The evolutionary pattern of nuclear receptors was analysed using a quantitative 
comparison of the divergence within a common set of holometabolous insect species Branch 
lengths of phylogenetic tree for each nuclear receptor were first computed by maximum 
likelihood methods Then the computed trees were compared through a morphometric 
approach by means of a principal component analysis PCA Here we considered each tree 
as an  individual  harbouring a morphology with a specific size the total length of the tree 
ie the average number of substitutions per site that occurred during the evolution of 
holometabolous insects and a specific form the relative lengths of the branches ie the 
divergence observed along each lineage Despite the availability of the Bombyx genome it 
was sometimes impossible to recover some suitable sequences for Lepidoptera Therefore we 
performed analyses with four species all the 18 nuclear receptors or with five species only 
12 proteins see materials and methods Both studies reveal the same pattern on factorial 
maps Fig 4AB Supp Fig2AB 
Nearly all variables branch lengths are correlated with the first principal axis that 
explains a large part of the variance 57 with four species and 63 with five species Fig 
4A Supp Fig2A This is consistent with a classical result in morphometry where the first 
axis of the PCA translates the variation of the global size of individuals in our case the 
variation in the total length of the phylogenetic trees Jolicoeur and Mosimann 1960 In 
other words the first axis ranks the nuclear receptors according to the average amount of 
substitutions per site If we consider that the selected sites for each of the nuclear receptors 
constitute representative and comparable samples of each gene regions encompassed in the 
DBD and LBD domains then the first axis distributes nuclear receptors along a gradient 
180608 
from genes with most constrained evolution for example SVP FTZ-F1 HR39 HR38 to 
genes with higher rates of evolution in holometabolous insects for example USP HR78 
ERR E78 HR83 
The second principal axis supports a large part of the remaining variance 38 with 
four species and 61 with five species Fig 4B Supp Fig2B This remaining variance 
translates the diversity of the evolutionary patterns observed between nuclear receptors if we 
exclude the heterogeneity of their global evolution rates viewed on the first principal axis 
Strikingly the second axis is highly correlated with only one variable in both cases the length 
of the Mecopterida-Diptera branch for the four species trees or the length of the 
Mecopterida branch for the five species trees Importantly this variable is poorly correlated 
with PCA axis 1 showing that the global evolutionary rate of each protein does not explain 
the variability of the divergence along this branch Furthermore the second principal axis is 
remarkably supported by the existence of a highly discriminated group of five nuclear 
receptors  HR4 E75 USP ECR and HR3 Fig 4B Supp Fig2B which show a longer 
Mecopterida branch when compared to other nuclear receptors This group of five proteins 
with a strong divergence along the Mecopterida stem branch is also clearly revealed by 
hierarchical clustering analysis based on factorial coordinates Fig 4D Supp Fig2D 
Since a genome-wide acceleration occurring along the Mecopterida and Diptera 
branches was reported recently for housekeeping genes Savard et al 2006a  Savard et al 
2006b and for a larger sample of single-copy orthologs Zdobnov and Bork 2007 we 
examined the specificity of the evolutionary acceleration of these five nuclear receptors by 
projecting published insects phylogenomic trees onto the factorial maps established for 
nuclear receptors Fig 4AB Supp Fig2AB Considering that the projected points are not 
clustered with the five discriminated proteins and that they are scattered within the group of 
other nuclear receptors we conclude that the acceleration affecting HR4 E75 USP ECR and 
180608 
HR3 constitutes an additional event to the global genomic trend All the other nuclear 
receptors followed the trend of evolution that characterise the Mecopterida divergence 
Interestingly we can also notice that the projection of the phylogenomic tree estimated with 
housekeeping proteins Savard et al 2006b is placed on the left of the factorial map close to 
more constrained genes  in Fig 4A Since housekeeping proteins are assumed to be under 
strong selective constraints this result is consistent with the interpretation of the first principal 
Thus HR4 E75 USP ECR and HR3 underwent an overacceleration of evolutionary 
rate during the emergence of the Mecopterida clade which did not affect the other nuclear 
receptors 
34 Coevolution at the top of the ecdysone regulatory cascade 
Remarkably the five overaccelerated nuclear receptors act together in the upstream 
part of the ecdysone regulatory cascade that triggers Drosophila metamorphosis King-Jones 
and Thummel 2005 ECR and USP constitute the heterodimeric ecdysone receptor E75 is a 
primary early response gene and HR3 and HR4 are early late genes However other nuclear 
receptors acting early during this hormonal response such as E78 HR39 or FTZ-F1 do not 
show this overacceleration Fig 4 It seems therefore that only some part of the upstream 
ecdysone regulatory network may have evolved rapidly in Mecopterida In order to test this 
hypothesis we completed a principal component analysis with twelve transcription factors 
known to regulate the top of this cascade the eight nuclear receptors described above plus 
E74 Ecdysone induced protein 74EF BR Broad E93 Ecdysone induced protein 93F and 
Kr-h1 Kruppel-homolog 1 The factorial map discloses a clear separation between two 
groups of proteins Fig 5 We find the same cluster of five nuclear receptors plus Kr-h1 
180608 
with the overacceleration along the Mecopterida-Diptera branch The other group contains 
E74 E93 BR and the three nuclear receptors HR39 FTZ-F1 and E78 
This result shows that six out of the twelve classic transcriptional regulators known to 
act at the top of the ecdysone pathway underwent an overacceleration in Mecopterida 
Consequently we can assume that coevolution probably occurred between a sub-network of 
overaccelerated nuclear receptors that control the ecdysone regulatory cascade Fig 6 
4 Discussion 
41 The set of nuclear receptors is conserved in holometabolous insects 
The set of nuclear receptor genes in holometabolous insects ranges from 20 in Aedes 
aegypti to 22 in honeybee Fig 1 The evolution of this metazoan protein family is complex 
with many variations duplications losses around a common theme of six subfamilies 
Bertrand et al 2004 Unlike nematodes where the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans and 
Caenorhabditis briggsae contain 283 and 268 nuclear receptors respectively Stein et al 
2003 the monophyletic group of holometabolous insects did not experience a lineage-
specific expansion within the nuclear receptors family If more genomic data are needed to 
understand the surprising diversity observed in ecdysozoans it is now clear that there is a 
strong conservation of the number and identity of nuclear receptors in holometabolous 
insects 
One novelty is the presence of the NR2E6 gene in Tribolium and in Apis but not in 
Diptera In honeybee the transcripts of this gene were found in the brain and in the eye of 
pupa and adult a pattern of expression which is reminiscent of the retina-specific pattern of 
PNR the human homolog of HR51 Velarde et al 2006 Interestingly all the members of 
180608 
the NR2E group apparently share a primary function in the developing nervous system 
Laudet and Bonneton 2005 The beetle genome like the honeybee is less derived than the 
Diptera genome and contains more ancestral genes It is possible that NR2E6 is one of these 
ancestral genes that will eventually be identified in other arthropods The question of its 
origin remains open since it is absent in vertebrates and in nematodes 
The fact that the two model organisms Drosophila and Tribolium have very similar 
sets of nuclear receptors is very promising for the understanding of this family in insects 
Indeed it means that genetic and physiologic studies based on both species will complement 
each other and should have general implications for other holometabolous insects However 
homologous genes can give different proteins because of divergent evolutionary rates that 
can occur even in the absence of gene duplication and loss In that respect USP HR78 ERR 
E78 and HR83 seem to be less constrained with higher rates of evolution in holometabolous 
insects when compared to SVP FTZ-F1 HR39 or HR38 Fig 4A Such divergences must 
be taken into account for future comparisons as evidenced by our work showing that if USP 
has a large liganded pocket in Drosophila and in the moth Heliothis it is an orphan receptor 
with no ligand binding pocket in Tribolium Clayton et al 2001 Billas et al 2001 Iwema et 
al submitted The opportunity to analyse Drosophila and Tribolium at the same time should 
reveal more about such fundamental differences between nuclear receptors Tribolium is 
particularly favoured as a model as its development is more representative of the early 
holometabolous insects 
42 Nuclear receptors display two modes of evolutionary rate in holometabolous insects 
We have previously shown that two nuclear receptors ECR and USP underwent an 
acceleration of evolutionary rate in Mecopterida Bonneton et al 2003 Bonneton et al 
180608 
2006 Both proteins heterodimerise to constitute the ecdysone receptor in insects as well as in 
crabs and ticks Henrich 2005 Therefore they act together at the top of an essential 
hormonal pathway that controls developmental timing and metabolism in arthropods Since 
both proteins are involved in so many vital interactions such a divergence must require 
coevolution of their other partners Actually it was revealed recently that a genome-wide 
acceleration occurred along the Mecopterida branch Savard et al 2006a Savard et al 2006b 
Zdobnov and Bork 2007 Thus it was possible that other nuclear receptors experienced the 
same evolution This possibility was tested by a quantitative analysis of the evolutionary rate 
which revealed two important features of this family 
First we have found that nuclear receptors show a gradient of average substitution 
rates during the radiation of holometabolous insects from slow evolving proteins whose 
structure and function are known to be highly conserved throughout animals such as 
SVPCOUP-TF HNF4 or HR38NURR1 to fast evolving proteins such as HR83 or E78 
Assuming that housekeeping genes which by definition are expressed in all cells and at all 
times are under strong purifying selection the comparison of evolution patterns between 
nuclear receptors and housekeeping genes Savard et al 2006a  Savard et al 2006b or genes 
from larger genomic samples Zdobnov and Bork 2007 leads us to conclude that the 
majority of nuclear receptors underwent high selective pressure in insects Only HR83 E78 
ERR HR78 and USP show a likely more relaxed evolution than housekeeping genes 
Second our results show that nuclear receptors can be divided into two groups 
according to their rate of evolution during the early divergence of the Mecopterida clade In 
one group of 13 proteins the rate is similar to the Mecopterida genome acceleration Savard 
et al 2006b In a second group of five nuclear receptors ECR USP HR3 E75 and HR4 
we observe an overacceleration of the evolutionary rate along the Mecopterida stem branch 
which is suggestive of a release of selective pressure after the initial event of genome-wide 
180608 
acceleration Notably this putative release plays on the LBD but not on the DBD which 
structure and sequence remained very constrained in every receptor Table 1 This 
overacceleration can be detected by a simple phylogenetic analysis producing trees where the 
Mecopterida species are significantly separated from the other holometabolous species The 
only exception is HR78 which shows a Mecopterida divergence on the trees despite a lack of 
overacceleration In that case the aberrant topology is likely due to the extreme divergence of 
the Bombyx mori sequence Fig 4Hirai 2002 The PCA method is thus more reliable to 
detect such events especially if the taxonomic sample is small and not fully representative of 
the phylogeny 
We can now conclude that the acceleration of ECR and USP observed initially is in 
fact an overacceleration which concerns three other nuclear receptors as well This 
overacceleration occurred during the diversification of Mecopterida approximately 280-300 
million years ago early Permian In any rigour the fact that this divergence is Mecopterida 
specific requires analysis of sequences from all groups of this superorder not only Diptera 
and Lepidoptera but also Trichoptera Mecoptera and Siphonaptera This evidence has been 
provided for ECR and for USP Bonneton et al 2006 
43 Overacceleration at the top of the ecdysone cascade in Mecopterida 
If we consider the five overaccelerated nuclear receptors E75 HR3 ECR USP and 
HR4 they share an obvious common characteristic they all act at the top of the ecdysone 
cascade that triggers metamorphosis Most effects of ecdysone are mediated through the 
heterodimeric ECR-USP receptor that directly regulates the transcriptional activity of the 
three other nuclear receptors E75 Eip75B the classic puff at E75B is induced as a primary 
early response gene while HR3 and HR4 are induced as early late genes King-Jones and 
180608 
Thummel 2005 HR3 is induced after puparium formation represses early genes and is a 
direct activator of the prepupal regulator FTZ-F1 In Drosophila as well as in Bombyx E75 
acts as a repressor of HR3 through direct heterodimerisation White 1997 Swevers 2002 
Hiruma 2004 Palanker et al 2006 HR4 acts with HR3 in the regulation of target genes 
including FTZ-F1 King-Jones et al 2005 Therefore cross-regulatory interactions between 
E75 HR3 and HR4 converge on FTZ-F1 to discriminate between the ecdysone responses of 
the first puparium and second pupation hormonal peaks that initiate the metamorphosis 
process All these results show that the five overaccelerated nuclear receptors are important 
players of the same regulatory network 
Several other proteins are known to act early in the ecdysone pathway Among these 
classic regulators are the nuclear receptors E78 and HR39 as well as different transcription 
factors such as E74 BR E93 and Kr-h1 Our results show that these genes did not 
experienced the Mecopterida overacceleration One exception is Kr-h1 an ecdysone-
regulated gene encoding a zinc-finger protein which modulates the prepupal response 
Pecasse et al 2000 Beck et al 2005 Unfortunately nothing is known about its possible 
contacts with other key proteins of the ecdysone pathway We hypothesize that the upstream 
part of the ecdysone cascade includes at least one network of closely interacting proteins that 
might be physically independent of the other regulators This modularity would explain the 
coevolution of the five nuclear receptors that act together If one member of the network 
suddenly accumulates mutations then a parallel overacceleration of its partners would help to 
maintain their interactions The rate of evolution is higher when the connecting proteins have 
transient interactions which is the case for nuclear receptors Pal et al 2006 In such a 
scenario the interface domains would be the main targets of molecular adaptation 
Interestingly by comparing Drosophila and Tribolium we found that the ecdysone binding 
ability of ECR has not changed during this evolution However the heterodimerisation 
180608 
surface between ECR and USP has accumulated changes therefore creating a new interface 
unpublished results In the same line of idea it would be very interesting to compare the 
evolution of the dimerisation contacts that occur between HR3 and E75 If physical 
interactions often induce coevolution then coevolution can help to detect new interactions 
Indeed different methods are using coevolution between proteins domains or even between 
amino acids to predict biological networks Pazos et al 1997 Lichtarge et al 2003 Fraser 
et al 2004 
The patterns of evolution among nuclear receptors are in fact not always so 
straightforward For example USP also heterodimerise with HR38 SVP and HR78 Baker et 
al 2003 Miura et al 2002 Zhu et al 2003 Hirai et al 2002 However none of these 
proteins shows the Mecopterida overacceleration Some of these interactions are even 
conserved in vertebrates such as RXR USP with NURR1 and NGFIB HR38 In such 
cases it is possible that coevolution concerns only few amino acids resulting in an 
undetectable acceleration in our analysis of the whole LBD Testing this possibility requires 
to determine the structure of the heterodimer in order to map the putative accelerated 
residues 
44 Maintenance of the ecdysone pathway 
If the proteins of a network controlling the ecdysone cascade have diverged then what 
about the network itself In other words is the ecdysone response different between 
Mecopterida and other holometabolous insects species Most of the functional studies have 
been done using Diptera and Lepidoptera species and the advent of Tribolium as a new model 
will allow filling this lack of data However all available evidences suggest that this vital 
hormonal control is well conserved among insects Truman and Riddiford 2002 Lafont et 
180608 
al 2005 To cite only the most recent and compelling results Xavier Bells and his 
colleagues in Barcelona have shown using the heterometabolous insect Blattella germanica 
that the phenocopies of ECR USP and HR3 genes mimic very closely the phenotype of the 
corresponding mutants in Drosophila Cruz et al 2006 Martin et al 2006 Cruz et al 
2007 These Blattella proteins are more similar to their Tribolium homologs than to their 
Mecopterida homologs Therefore we can reasonably assume that despite the acceleration of 
six major regulators acting at the top of the ecdysone cascade the output of this pathway is 
very likely conserved among holometabolous and heterometabolous insects This view is 
compatible with the coevolution hypothesis presented above For things to remain the same 
everything must change Tomasi di Lampedusa 1958
