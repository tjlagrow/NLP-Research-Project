Abstract
Based on an observer-centric methodology which is conceptually and operationally most direct
we pinpoint the most basic origin of the spectral Planckianity of the asymptotic Hawking modes
which is generic to the conventional treatments of the evolving horizons Analyzing spacetimes
marked by the sole virtue of possessing causal horizons we clarify in details how this spectral
Planckianity is geometrically imposed on the exponentially-redshifted propagating Hawking modes
through a holographically-illicit jumbling mechanism which is developed by an environment of
the curvature modes in the causal patch of the asymptotic observer We verify that this mechanism
is stable under broad variations of geometries topologies and categories of the causal horizons in
all the Minkoswki dS and AdS asymptotics
In the continuation we elucidate the underlying
microscopic physics of the actual phenomenon of the Hawking evaporation of causal horizons
The description is based on a novel holographic scheme of gravitational open quantum systems in
which the degrees of freedom that build up the curvature of the observers causal patch interact
with the released Hawking modes initially as environmental quanta and later as quantum defects
Planckian dispersion of the modes can only be developed in the strict thermodynamic limit of
the quantum environment the so-called optimal jumbler Finally we characterize how this
holographic microscopic formulation does realize the information-theoretic processing of unitarity
I MOTIVATION AND INTRODUCTION
Quest for the universal and nature-wise successful theory of quantum gravity is lively
going on The aim is the discovery of a complete theory of quantum gravity which not only
is self-consistent and gravitationally-meant nonperturbative but also being maximally
generic in its phenomenological board of applicability
is successfully predictive on this
physical nature that we commonly observe Through the long course of the collaborative
research we have conducted so far a number of extremely deep lessons have been extracted
on how conceptually distinguished the correct formulation of this aimed quantum gravity
must be The holographic way by which gravity and spacetime must intrinsically emerge
is one example 25 However as the major lessons are yet incomplete a complete list of
the correct principles is still to be discovered But no doubt we aim to get there
Up until now
in the void of direct or even helpfully indirect experimental data in
quantum gravity we have been mainly hinted by several methodologically signicant
theoretical laboratories on how to advance forward Centered in the most exciting core
of all these theoretical laboratories is the open question of discovering the correct and
complete microscopic formulation of the phenomenologically generic black holes
methodological signicance is because their horizons are the best initiative zone where the
most characteristic aspects of quantum physics do unavoidably interpenetrate with those
of classical gravity But apart from some alien category of supersymmetric black holes a
lucid understanding of the microscopic physics of these objects is yet missing
We must highlight that our majorly incomplete understanding of the constitutional
microscopic system of the generic black holes and their so-produced quantum behavior
is not because the correct description of the near-singularity-region is unknown to
us but primarily because we do not yet understand properly the horizon namely the
dening holographic screen of these objects There are two good reasons for this priority
discernment The minor reason is that the horizon scale where quantum physics and
classical gravity fuse is decoupled from the quantum curvature corrections for large
black holes But the major reason is that black hole physics is by means of holography
a decodication of the physics of the horizon many body system
In understanding the correct microscopic system of causal horizons the rst arena
where we need to clean up the illusions of the semiclassical description and to replace them
with the correct microscopic physics is the information paradox  This is indeed the aim
of this study Fortunately there are very good introductory material on this subject 30
so the background can be escaped Now let us give a brief introduction to this paper
To conclusively reinstate the indestructibility of the initial-state information bits in
the Hawking evaporation of causal horizons as a rst step we may better pinpoint the
exact correct origin of their illusory Planckian-loss in the conventional settings where
black hole physics has been congurated This root-problem identication is the main
subject of the part A of this work For this we single out the original observation in 1
which was inspired by 2 and by a thorough re-analysis unfold the important messages
hidden in it The most unique virtue of our study compared to the related literature is its
most straightforward methodology This method is speculation minimalistic and in being
observer based  is also operationally most direct
The part A includes chapters two to ve of this study First in chapter two we thoroughly
work out our observer-centric analysis in the canonical example of Schwarzschild spacetime
in arbitrary dimensions and already extract the main macroscopic lessons Incorporating
all the relevant deformations within a broad spectrum of examples we do successfully
verify the robustness and the generality of our principal approach by applying it to the
NUT hole and the Kerr black hole in chapter three then to the Schwarzschild de Sitter
black hole the Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black hole and the cylindrical black hole in
chapter four and nally to the Rindler horizon and the de Sitter horizon in chapter ve
The part B brings this work into a deeper level
First
it carefully unfolds the
foundational microscopic lessons underlying the macroscopic outcomes of the part A
Second  it so develops the quantum structure of a holographic microscopic formulation
that realizes the unitarity of information processing in the horizon evaporation
Third 
to further xing the exact dynamics of the evolving causal horizons it interconnects this
so-structured formalism with the observer-based fundamental theory being proposed in 33

THE HOW

II ASYMPTOTIC HAWKING MODES FROM THE EVENT HORIZONS
 THE CANONICAL EXAMPLE
In this beginning chapter of our research we dene our observer-centric method  and
utilize it to thoroughly analyze our canonical example as the rst case-study among a
much broader family of spacetimes that will be explored later in this study to conrm
the generality and the robustness of both our methodology and its conclusive statements
This canonical case-study sets up a good physical basis for our novel understanding of the
physical nature of the almost Planckian prole of the asymptotic Hawking radiation whose
in-depth information theoretic perspectives will be addressed in the part B of this paper
Before working out in details our canonical example let us rst say a few words on the
physical setting in which we develop all our forthcoming analyses
We choose to congurate and develop our prototype analysis and consecutively the
information theoretic proposals concluded from it on the basis of an observationally
direct methodology which was originally and successfully utilized in 1 We also decide
to take a most generic stance in our study and explore the landscape of spacetimes which
are characterized by the sole virtue of possessing a causal horizon namely a compact
or noncompact null hypersurface that joins two causally disconnected complementary
regions of the geometry For every such spacetime we carefully set up and work out a
prototype thought experiment in which a suciently far static observer Bob receives
and spectrally analyzes initially monochromatic null rays of Hawking modes which
starting from the immediate proximity of the horizon have propagated toward his detector
all through his causal-patch geometry The spectral analysis that Bob performs on the
detected rays of Hawking modes is primarily on their frequency distribution much like
a radio astronomer and subsequently on their particle-energy distribution much like a
particle-detector analysist With this same thought experiment we explore a broad class of
spacetimes with variations in horizon geometry and topology and also in the asymptotics
and in this way probe into the information content of the asymptotic Hawking modes
We nally show what this observer-centric analysis unfolds about the the interplay of the
Bobby geometry and propagating Hawking modes
Having explained the general scheme of our analysis we are now at the right stage
to commence this basically distinct study of the information paradox by specic examples
Our canonical case-study is nothing but the simplest of all possible examples that is
a classically-static spherically-symmetric spacetime possessing a quantum-evaporating
compact event horizon namely the Schwartzchild black hole For the sake of maximal
generality we will conduct the analysis of this chapter in arbitrary number of spacetime
dimensions but will later stick to four spacetime dimensions in all our next examples
The metric of a one parameter family of Schwarzchild black holes in D  4 spacetime
dimensions reads as 5
ds2  1 
rD3 dt2  1 
rD3 1dr2  dS2
D2
in which dSD2 is the metric of a D  2-dimensional sphere and
c2D  3
D3  
D  3
c  G  1
is the radius of the spacetimes event horizon
Now let us employ and work out our prototype thought experiment
in this simple
geometry Suppose that at an arbitrary initial time t  tin in the Schwarzschild temporal
coordinate a beam of initially mono-frequency Hawking modes begins to propagate radially
with the speed of light from a point in the immediate proximity of the the stretched
horizon say at rin  RH   with RH  1 and is eventually received and spectrally
analyzed by the observer Bob who is a late-time detecting static observer located at
a point suciently far  from the quantum-evaporating stretched horizon Let us further
suppose that Bobs location is distant-enough from the horizons vacuum-entanglement
zone 22 by which we mean a horizon-exterior region of a width of the order of the
horizon radius which gives regional support to those of the Hawking modes which are in a
vacuum-based maximal entanglement with their partner modes in the black holes interior
By these assumptions let us take the Bobs receiving of the above-imagined null rays to be
identied with a late-time spacetime event Pt r with rRH  1 The radial trajectory
of this light ray is given by the null geodesics
ds2  1 
rD3 dt2  1 
rD3 1dr2  0
leading to the equation
 1 
rD3 
Solving this equation say by using relation 2141 in 6 we end up with the following two
dierent solutions depending on the dimension of the spacetime being odd or even

into account that by assumption r  RH and   RH we nd that to the leading order
the trajectory is of the following form in both the cases up to an irrelevant constant term
r  t  tin 
D  3
Lncid18

Now let us recollect and use this basic fact that even in a stationary spacetime the frequency
of propagating modes as measured in terms of the proper time will be dierent at dierent
points of space and is being redshifted as it propagates outwardly reaching Bob at Pt r
The relation for the redshift between the light frequency in at rin and its frequency
received at time t by a static observer Bob located at r  RH  is given by 20
  in g00rin12
which as a consequence of the presence of the corresponding causal horizon leads to a
characteristic exponentially-redshifted time-dependent observed frequency of the form

Now the equation 11 manifests that despite being in a static spacetime the frequency of
the wave modes measured by Bob at some xed r  RH varies nontrivially with time t
Bob will not see a monochromatic radiation even though the beams were initially signaled
monochromatically from the immediate proximity of the horizon This time-dependence of
the mode frequencies as observed by Bob is a crucial point that can be clearly understood
by the following reasoning If we imagine a wave packet
centered on this null ray the instantaneous frequency would be related to its phase by
t r  expit r
Now integrating 11 with respect to the time variable t the relevant wave mode is found

Therefore our asymptotic static Bob who is using his Schwarzchild time coordinate t will

Manifesting the explicit dependence on the Newton constant G and the light velocity c
the result for the frequency spectrum of the distantly observed Hawking Modes becomes

  1cid211
in which the characteristic frequency 0 reads as
4G 
D  3
which depends non-trivially only on the horizon scale and the dimensionality of the
spacetime but is otherwise universal as it must be
let us make a preliminary evaluation of the meanings of the results 1920
we have just obtained and also take a rst look into the physics lessons that are
extractable from it while we postpone a thorough elucidation of these points to the specic
chapters on the black hole information paradox which will be presented in the part B of
this paper
Equations 1920 conclude what a late-time detecting
asymptotic static observer
Bob experimentally obtains for the frequency spectrum of the Hawking modes that were
monochromatically released in the stretched horizon band and then propagated as radial
null rays all through horizons exterior bulk to be received by his static detector Now one
principal fact that we instantly recognize is the following
The observed spectral distribution that we found up here for the distantly propagated
Hawking modes equations 1920 is nothing but the very Planckian frequency spectrum
although the procedure that we followed to obtain it was a solely classical one
That is we must highlight not only the nal result for the asymptotically observed
frequency spectrum is a manifestly classical formula with no -dependence in it but also
nowhere in the entire thought-experiment analysis we conducted to obtain this Planckian
spectrum of the Hawking modes quantum physics played any role whatsoever No doubt
on the other hand the primal emergence of the Hawking modes out of the near-horizon
vacuum is an intrinsically quantum phenomenon as we know very well
As one more highlight we must appreciate the very crucial point that
Evaluating information theoretically already in the classically obtained equations 1920
the very essence of the information loss is clearly present That is the asymptotically
observed Planckian multi-chromaticity of the initially monochromatic Hawking beams is
itself the very same phenomenon of the semiclassical information loss
So the horizon evaporation is a quantum eect but the procedure which jumbles
the initial-state information content of the Hawking modes during their propagation in
the horizon-exterior bulk has nothing to do with quantum eects in fact as we will later
elaborate on it turns out that
The asymptotically-observed Planckian-loss of information can only occur in a strict
environmental thermodynamic limit which will be specied later in this work Once the
Hawking modes are quantum sourced in the proximity of the stretched horizon the physics
that so-optimally jumbles the initial beams of
information-theoretically contentful
modes into the spectrally-Planckian contentless asymptotic modes is an observer-bulk
geometric mechanism actualizable in the thermodynamic limit of a microscopic geometric
environment
Further we ask if there also comes an actual or eective thermalization
into this
optimal jumbling of the radiated-out information bits Intuitively this question is natural
to be raised knowing the fact that the horizon itself is a well-dened thermal system
with a nite temperature and then also knowing that a Planckian prole information loss
is so typical of a black body radiation
If that is so then a simple combination of the
dimensional analysis together with the universality of this phenomenon implies that the
associated temperature of the asymptotic radiation has to be proportional to a universal
constant of the dimension  namely proportional to the  itself That this associated
temperature is an unavoidably quantum eect is a second crucial fact which we will later
take notice of in order to unfold the actual information-theoretic physics underlying the
Hawking radiation in the part B of this paper
As the simplest way that the already anticipated quantum thermal character of the
asymptotic Hawking radiation becomes manifest in our thought-experiment approach
let us go back once more to the equations 1920 for the frequency spectrum of the
distantly propagated modes as detected by Bob This time however let us suppose that
our asymptotic observer Bob who was up until now a sole radio astronomer has just
renewed his device from a radio-frequency detector to a quantum-particle detector to
see if he would also detect an asymptotic Planckian power-spectrum of quantum beeps
By experimentally doing so in his lab and concluding the measurement of the energy
distribution of the detected beeps his so-obtained experimental plot on the power spectrum
of the distantly-propagated Hawking modes will t a distribution formula which is found
by simply re-expressing the classical distribution 1920 in terms of the quantum energy
eigenvalues E   that is 7
f 2 cid20exp
  1cid211
cid20exp
  1cid211
Therefore the experimentally-plotted power spectrum of the asymptotic Hawking modes
would be the Planckian blackbody distribution at the well-dened temperature
D  3
which is indeed the same result obtained in the literature by independent methods 8 and
for D  4 does reduce to the Hawking temperature for a 4-d Schwarzschild black hole 1
Let us highlight in passing a subtle point worthy of a special notice Note that all we have
seen so far is that the classically-sourced maximal dispersion of the initial-state information
bits and their eective quantum thermalization do consistently come together in the
system of propagating Hawking modes interacting with the horizon-exterior geometry
but not that it is this thermalization that causes that dispersion These two statements are
both logically and physically very dierent from one another and we only approve the former
one To become crystal clear note that by turning o  the thermalization does banish
but yet the classical geometric procedure of the information-theoretic jumbling given by
1920 totally survives That is the classical geometric dispersion of the information bits
and the eective internal quantum thermalization of those modes are causally speaking
independent phenomena
Before moving to the next chapter
let us further bring to the readers attention an
indirect historic remark a point which is in a beautiful conceptual accord with our
discussions up until now and is moreover insightful by itself It was priorly observed in 2
that by Fourier decomposing the complex Minkowski plane wave of a massless scalar eld
t x  eikxt with respect to the proper time of a uniformly accelerated observer
one is interestingly led to a similar Planckian spectrum as seen by the observer Therefore
on the basis of the equivalence principle which allows replacing an accelerated observer
with constant proper acceleration g in at spacetime with a static observer in an actual
gravitational eld of the same characteristic strength one must have intuitively expected
to obtain the very same classical result 1920
Indeed in ordinary cgs units it was
shown that 2
P  
  11
where g is the proper acceleration of the observer and  is the frequency of the decomposed
wave component measured by the same observer The Planckian spectrum 23 is also a
classical result with no  included in it Moreover the very procedure that had led to
it was also entirely classical So it is a merely classical phenomenon by all its nature
But yet indeed it does precisely resemble its very twin result in the Unruh eect which
is nevertheless a quantum eld theoretic eect by its nature Now once more by simply
rewriting the frequency-spectrum formula 23 in the form of an energy-spectrum being
expressed in terms of the massless quantum bits of energy which constitute the associated
beams we get
P E 
  11
which is again a Planckian blackbody distribution at the well-dened temperature
This result indeed resembles very well as it should the closely-related case of the Rindlers
observer which we will later directly address in this paper Indeed the specic case of the
Rindeler spacetime is specially interesting as it simulates the near horizon region of the
typical black holes if as demanded by the equivalence principle nothing special is recorded
by an infalling observer while crossing the horizon But independent of its signicance
already with this early result we can do a little bit better
By invoking again the equivalence principle in equating the temperature 24 with the
Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole 22 also re-manifesting the dependences
on the constants c and G we obtain
which is nothing but the surface gravity of a Schwarzschild black hole
fullling our
preceding intuitive expectation
As a fact that we will verify example-wise and will also conceptually discuss later
in this paper let us nally mention the fact that
The presence of a causally-disconnecting null-boundary to be called a causal horizon is
central to the Planckian jumbling of the information bits
III ASYMPTOTIC HAWKING MODES IN STATIONARY SPACETIMES
 THE NUT HOLE AND THE KERR BLACK HOLE
Let us begin with a brief wording on our motive in probing all the further examples which
in the rest of the part A of this work we will be considering The directly observer-based
thought-experiment method that we successfully employed to obtain and analyze the
semiclassical asymptotic aspects of the Hawking radiation in the canonical example of
the Schwarzschild black hole
is both concept-wise and formulation-wise intrinsically
dierent from the standard approaches to this subject Therefore we do need to make
sure if beyond merely being a computational coincidence or a simplest-case matching
we can trust this approach as a rmly-based and generally-applicable root methodology
to further investigate the physical nature of the Hawking radiation and to formulate the
correct theory of the quantum-evolving horizons Thus we must examine if this approach
successfully and also impartially goes through for the generic spacetimes possessing
causal horizons Of course we would not need to work out every possible example
individually but instead we can manifest the robustness and generality of this approach by
verifying that it is successfully stable under all the major physical deformations applied
both on the spacetime geometry and on the virtues of causal horizons
To accomplish this verication we will be carefully selecting and scanning over a good
number of broadly-dierent examples which are marked by extreme physical distinctions in
the local global and in the causal structure of the spacetime In particular we consider
deformations on the characteristics such as the symmetries asymptotics and complexities of
spacetime as well as the horizon topologies and the very nature of the causal horizons By
this suciently-broad investigation we will indeed verify the success of this methodology
over the landscape of all the most major and relevant physical deformations
It must be
highlighted that this verication is for us a necessity not just for the value of the method
by itself but primarily because our aim is to discover the correct and complete resolution
of the black hole information paradox and to develop the correct microscopic theory of the
evolving horizons for which in the part B of this study we will take instrumental lessons
obtained here by this methodology
And now a nal word on the related generalities needs to be said As a by-product
which is conceptually interesting even all-independent of the Hawking radiation aspects
one conrms by this broad analysis the following statement
In order for an initially
monochromatic beam of null rays to become a system of spectrally-Planckian multi-frequency
modes as observed by an asymptotic observer the pretense of a null horizon in the associated
remote-past of the observer is necessary
In this chapter we examine our methodology in obtaining the characteristics of the
asymptotic Hawking radiation in the case of stationary spacetimes with event horizons
In doing so we follow the selection strategy that was just explained up here That is
we select a pair of examples which deformation-wise are physically complementary to
each other The two complementary spacetimes that we analyze in the following are the
NUT hole versus the Kerr black hole Because in probing each example we will realize and
analyze the same direct thought experiment based on the spectral analysis of an asymptotic
observer Bob we will not overweight the presentations with loads of repetitive details
unless being conceptually necessary In other words we will be brief but not too brief The
two examples being complementary our detailing in the NUT hole example will still be
a little more involved because in the case of the Kerr black hole the details were already
worked out in the primary reference of this study 1
A The NUT Hole
We begin with the example of the NUT hole spacetime because based on its physical
aspects it is in fact the most straightforward generalization of the Schwarzschild spacetime
Reading from the symmetries of the metric of the spacetime the NUT geometry is a
stationary axially-symmetric solution of the Einstein equations But physically behaving
the NUT spacetime is in fact a spherical spacetime To appreciate the discernment here
let us remember that the physical symmetries of a spacetime must be primarily identied
with the transformations under which the physical gauge-invariant observables of the
spacetime are invariant But as the spacetime metric is not directly a physical observable
its symmetries do not need to necessarily coincide with the physical symmetries of the
spacetime NUT spacetime does realize this distinction because unlike its metric tenser
all of its curvature invariants are indeed spherically symmetric
Then there is also a secondary methodology by which the physical symmetries of a
spacetime can be identied In this observer-based methodology we identify the symmetries
of the spacetime by the invariances of the physical observables which are intrinsically dened
with respect to a global family of observers who are represented by a congruence of timelike
curves treading the spacetime In this approach known as the threading decomposition of
the spacetime Einstein equations are being inspiringly re-expressed in an exact form as a
nonlinear version of the Maxwell equations formulated in terms of the gravitoelectric and
the gravitomagnetic elds which are dened for the family of observers In this view the
mass parameter m becomes the gravitoelectric charge but then the spacetime can be as
well endowed with a gravitomagnetic monopole of charge 
In this sense the NUT spacetime which is being xed by the two parameters m 
becomes the most straightforward and the simplest generalization of the Schwarzschild
geometry because now in the center of the spacetime both a gravitoelectric monopole
and a gravitomagnetic monopole are present manifestly respecting the physically-dened
spherical symmetry As such one indeed shows that all the physical observables
particular the gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic elds of the NUT hole spacetime are
spherically symmetric 15
The metric of the NUT spacetime with the charges m l can be best written in
the following form 14 15
ds2  f rdt  2l cos d2 
f r  r2  l2d2
f r 
r2  2mr  l2

The spacetime being physically spherical there indeed are radial null geodesics which are
given by 14

in which r  m m2  l212 are the two well-known event horizons of the NUT solution
The above equation can be integrated as
which are the physically-anticipated radial null geodesic of the spacetime

r  1cid12cid12cid12cid12

r  1cid12cid12cid12cid12
It should be highlighted that in the case of the NUT metric there are no intrinsic
singularities hidden behind the horizon justifying the given name NUT hole Also it is
to be noted that the two horizons of the geometry separate the stationary NUT regions
r  r and r  r from the time-dependent Taub regions r  r  r of the so-called
Tuub-NUT spacetime which are causally disconnected 14
Now let us apply and examine our directly observer-based thought-experiment methodology
to this causally-nontrivial spacetime As set in the canonical example we consider a beam
of initially-monochromatic light rays of Hawking modes that propagate radially from an
initial point in the immediate proximity of the outer event horizon r   at time
t  tin to be received by the asymptotic observer Bob at the late-time event Pt r
with r  r and   r The equation of such trajectory has the following form

The redshifted frequency  will be related to the initial frequency in in at rin by

By applying the very same detailed procedure used in the Schwarzschild example now to
NUT spacetime we nally obtain the following power spectrum for a wave packet which
has scattered o the outer event horizon of the NUT hole reaching the observer Bob at late
times and at r  r

The result 32 does conrm the validity of our method in its application to the NUT hole
spacetime Indeed it manifestly is the classically-obtained Planckian frequency spectrum of
the distantly-measured Hawking modes which if being re-expressed in terms of the energy
quanta received in Bobs particle detector as we discussed in the previous chapter leads
to a standard Planckian radiation at the well-dened temperature

Let us notice that indeed 33 matches with the standard result in the literature 10 11
and also that it reduces to that of the Schwarzschild case when l  0
B The Kerr Black Hole
The second case is the Kerr black hole The method has already been worked out in
1 Kerr black hole is a two-parameter stationary spacetime which being axially symmetric
both mathematically and physically does not have radial null geodesics and so one should
use principal null congruences to apply the Fourier decomposition method It also contains
two horizons which not only divide the spacetime into causally disconnected regions but
also hide an intrinsic singularity from the outer region Another point is the fact that the
innite redshift surface and the event horizon do not coincide This will require a careful
employment of the above procedure taking into account the existence of the ergosphere
region from inside which the outgoing null rays propagate to the observers at late time and
large distances Working out all these details we are led to the Planckian spectrum 1

IV ASYMPTOTIC HAWKING MODES IN MUCH BROADER SETTINGS
VARIATIONS OF GEOMETRIES TOPOLOGIES AND ASYMPTOTICS
We need to highlight in the very beginning of this chapter that everywhere in our
observer-based methodology by the asymptotic observer Bob what we collectively mean
is either an ideally-asymptotic observer or simply an observer whose static detector is
located at a suciently-far nite distance
from the causal horizon and receives the
bulk-propagated Hawing modes at a suciently-late nite time Appreciating this point
of sucient niteness will be important and in fact essential for us because of the
following two major reasons
The rst reason
is that there are physically important settings in each of which
there is a strict radial cuto  on the observers location set by the presence of a spacetime
boundary which is itself located at some nite distance from the radiating horizon One
obvious example which both theoretically and phenomenologically is a signicant one
is the case of an evolving black hole in de Sitter spacetimes in which the nite-size
cosmological horizon serves as the spacetime boundary
In fact the specic example of
the Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole which we study here is the canonical case of
these examples As being intuitively anticipated
in all these settings the black holes
whose size are comparable with that of the spacetime bubble do not experience any
eective evaporation because of the thermalization between the two horizons but the
black hole which are suciently smaller than the spacetimes boundary horizon do source a
net-positive Hawking radiation and so does evaporate monotonically
The second reason
is however an asynptotics-independent
universal one which is
intrinsically observer holographic and has a signicant information theoretic impact
Better elaborations on this crucial point will be postponed to the part B and much more
extensively to the microscopic theory conjectured in 33 but yet we most briey mention
it It turns out that in order to correctly and conclusively resolve the information paradox
based on a maximally-holographic complete microscopic theory the formulation must be
developed on the basis of Bob-type observers whose causal accommodation of the horizon
history is of nite-size Only then the innite limit can also be successful
Having probed the Schwarzschild the NUT and the Kerr horizons
let us now move
on to the second class of our deformational analysis Here we examine our directly
observer-based methodology under some more radical relevant deformations
physical settings in which the asymptotic behavior of the horizon Hawking radiation can
be congured In this chapter we examine three such physical deformations which form a
threefold complementarity
In the rst two of our threefold examples we scan over the dierent global phases
of the observers causal-patch geometry realized by the two possible deformations of the
spacetime asymptotics but then we keep the characteristics of the event horizon intact
These two asymptotically-complementary examples are Schwarzschild black holes with
the dS asymptotics and with the AdS asymptotics respectively We must highlight that
the very question of the impact of the spacetime asymptotics on both the semiclassical
and the actual spectrality of the Hawking modes is nontrivial in our approach This is
because our method is directly based on the asymptotic observers so is a global one by
its very conception Metaphorically the comparison between the path integral versus the
Hamiltonian denitions of quantum mechanics may be mentioned as an analogy
In the third example which is in the deformational sense complementary to both
of the afore-mentioned examples we consider the opposite setting in which we freeze the
asymptotics of the spacetime as automatically decided by the solution but then the
topology of the event horizon is being maximally deformed By a maximal deformation
of the horizon topology we mean that we alter its physically most important topological
characteristic namely the compactness virtue of the causal screen Here we address
by a well-chosen case-study the spacetimes with noncompact causal surfaces namely
causal domain walls of innite area which are event horizons of nite temperature and so
radiate-out Hawking modes Then by a similar method we obtain and spectrally analyze
the asymptotic radiation as semiclassically observed by the Bobby observers The specic
spacetime that we choose is the simplest and best representative of this class of examples
namely the asymptotically-AdS cylindrical black hole whose solution and thermal behavior
were initially obtained in 13
To make the presentation of the following examples compact
let us start with the
general form of a class of spacetime metrics that collectively encodes the solutions of the
three examples which we probe in this chapter This general metric in terms of the mass
parameter m and the cosmological constant  is given by 16 17
ds2 cid18k 
r2cid19 dt2 cid18k 
r2cid191
dr2  r2d2
The curvature parameter k takes the values 1 0 1 so that d2
k is the metric on a
Riemann surface k of constant Gaussian curvature k The surface k which can be
of dierent topologies will be the event horizon for the corresponding black hole solutions
When expressed in conventional angular local coordinates   the area element d2
takes the following forms
d2  sin2d2
d2  d2
d2  sinh2d2
k  1


The AdS cylindrical black hole corresponds to the above metric with k  0 and with a
negative  while both the Schwarzschild AdS and the Schwarzschild dS spacetimes are
given by this same metric with negative and positive values of  respectively upon taking
the choice k  1
A The Schwarzschild horizon in the de Sitter Phase
The de Sitter phase of quantum gravity that is the gravitational life with   0 is
drastically distinguished from the other two phases with   0 because of two reasons
First the physical supersymmetric enhancements are not possible in the de Sitter phase
Second  the de Sitter phase of quantum gravity must be holographically formulated by
quantum theories which are strictly nite-dimensional 24 27 The theory of black holes
in this phase is not only a physical sector of it but also serves as a precious laboratory in
developing the full theory of the de Sitter quantum gravity Here we employ our principal
method to the de Sitter phase The motive is as before to formulate the unitarity of the
horizon evolution by the lessons we make use of in the part B of this work
We so begin the analysis of this chapter with the example of the Schwarzschild-dS
horizon Given the metric which was identied before the radial null geodesics are
integrated from

If we restrict our attention to the case   0 and 9M 2G2  1 4 the above equation

are the roots of the equation drdt  0 In fact both rH  and rC have positive values
thereby dening the two horizons of the spacetime which are albeit of very dierent physical
natures The larger root rC is the de Sitter cosmological horizon but the smaller root
rH is the black hole event horizon The negative root rU  is unphysical Under the
condition 3M  1 the Schwarzschild black hole is sitting inside the cosmological
horizon Naturally we must be able to obtain the Hawking radiation related for either of
the horizons Here we only consider the case of the emission from the event horizon and
later in the next chapter will come back to that of the cosmological horizon By utilizing our
directly observer-based thought experiment as before we consider an outgoing radial light
ray which propagates from a point very close to inner horizon rin  rH   at t  tin
to the detecting event Pt r where rH  r  rC and   rH for an observer Bob of
the nite-distance r  rH  from the event horizon With the required initial condition we
will nd the corresponding trajectory in the following form
r  t  tin   Ln
So the redshifted frequency  will be related to the initial frequency at r  rH   by
  in exp
t  tin  r
Similar to the computations before we nd the asymptotic frequency spectrum to be
f 2 cid20exp
12rH
rC  rHrH  rU   1cid211
which in terms of the energy modes becomes a Planckian power spectrum at the temperature
rC  rHrH  rU 
This again coincides with the known result obtained from the conventional approach 4
Now in this same case of the Schwarzschild dS spacetime we may want to see if we can
successfully do our directly observer-based spectral analysis of the asymptotic Hawking
radiation for the modes which are initially emanated from the cosmological horizon We will
postpone answering this question to the next chapter
B The Schwarzschild-AdS Horizons
In this section we switch to the   0 phase and work out the example of the
Schwarzschild horizon with the AdS asymptotics Given the metric which we identied
before the location of the event horizon is determined by the zeros of the cubic equation
f r  r3  b2r  2mb2  0 
b2  
As the function f  is strictly monotonic this equation has only one root given by 9 19
sinhcid20 1
sinh133
cid21
Indeed in this example a black hole horizon is always present By expanding rH in term
of m with b  3m we have r  2m1  4m2b2     which shows that the   0
has a shrinking eect on the horizon scale For the outgoing light rays the radial geodesics
adopt the simple form

r  rHr2  rrH  2

Considering a light ray propagating from rin  rH   at t  tin to the detecting event
Pt r where rH  r  b and   rH the last equation becomes

H  2 Ln
The redshifted frequency  will be related to the frequency at rin by
  incid20 rin  rHr2  rrH  2

t  tincid21
As in the examples before we nd that the power spectrum for a wave packet scattered o
the event horizon and travelled to innity has the Plankian form at the temperature
H  2
This again matches with the result from the conventional approach 18 and does reduce to
that of the asymptotically-at Schwarzschild horizon for b  
C The Cylindrical Horizons
The third example that we probe in this section is the black hole with cylindrical event
horizon and with the AdS asymptotics 13 By a coordinate transformation the metric can
be brought to the form
ds2  b2r2 
dt2  b2r2 
1dr2  b2r2dz2  r2d2
where a  4M and b2  3 This is the metric of a static black hole whose event
horizon is at br  a13 and has a curvature singularity at r  0 Similar to the examples
before we consider radially ingoing light rays which propagate from the proximity of the
event horizon rin  a13b  at t  tin to the detecting event Pt r where rb  a13
and   r The equation governing the radial ingoing light rays in this space can be
written as follows

By solving this equation Relation 2145 in 6 we obtain

V HAWKING RADIATION FROM THE OBSERVER-BASED HORIZONS
An intrinsically-distinguished category of causal horizons in classical and quantum
gravity are the observer-based horizons These are well-dened horizons which causally
luck in their dening observers The Rindler horizon of an accelerating observer in the
Minkowski spacetimes is the canonical example of these causal bubbles A global spacetime
can be patch-wise partitioned and also re-assembled by a number of such observer-based
causal patches Once more the canonical example is the causal deconstruction of the
Minkowski spacetime into four Rindler wedges We must highlight that his is not a
physically content-empty deconstruction of the global spacetime because between these
complementary causal patches there can be fruitful and strong physical interplays For
example the vacuum-ness virtue of the Minkowski empty spacetime is faithfully related
with the maximal entanglements that interconnect the partnering pairs of the Rindler
wedges These regional maximal entanglements being re-verbalized in an underlying
abstract quantum formulation of the geometry can be proposed as the fundamental
fabricators of the physical spacetime 29
Let us highlight that by globally reassembling an entire generic spacetime with a
collection of suciently-many observer-based causal units can be a very natural and
very productive methodology in developing the complete theory of quantum gravity for the
spacetimes which are phenomenologically relevant to us A very intriguing observer-based
framework of this kind based on the identication of causal diamonds as the constituting
causal units has been already proposed and developed 27 Moreover an inter-related
but physically and mathematically new initiative proposal is being put forward in the
forthcoming paper 33 Any candidate formulation in this paradigm of quantum gravity
should begin with proposing the unit holographic microscopic theory in correspondence
with each one single causal unit So as the simplest model theory one could begin
with initiating a microscopic theory of one Rindler patch 28 But a much more gratifying
unit theory would be the microscopic theory of the dS causal patch namely the dS
static patch as for example proposals in 24 27 After obtaining the good theory of de
Sitter static patch we could then advance to the microscopic theory of the global de sitter
spacetime by the re-assembling methodology But the correct microscopic theory of the
dS causal patch is what we need phenomenologically
Within all these understandings and scopes through the rest of the current chapter
we will consider both of these canonical observer-based horizons The aim and the plan
would be the same as before We employ our directly observer-based methodology to
study the semiclassical behavior of the distantly propagated Hawking modes Besides the
further verication of our root-methodology this study will clarify to two facts First as a
by-product it independently reconrm the important statement that the observer-based
causal horizons does behave as the event horizons do in their semiclassically coarse-grained
and most-expectedly also in their very ne-grained aspects of the Hawking radiation But
second the important outcomes for us will be as before the universal distinguished lessons
on the mechanism of unitarity in the quantum evolution of the causal horizon that we take
from this macroscopic analysis here and will so utilize in the part B of this study and
as well in the forthcoming initiative work on the fundamental microscopic theory of the
evolving horizons 33
A Hawking Modes From The de Sitter Cosmological Horizon
Let us begin the study of this chapter with the de Sitter cosmological horizon while for
a discussion of the comparative physics of the de Sitter spacetime in dierent patches we
refer to 32 The static patch of the de Sitter spacetime is dened by the metric
ds2 cid181 
r2cid19 dt2 cid181 
r2cid191
dr2  r2d2
The cosmological horizon is the causally encompassing S2-surface with the nite radius
R  p3 Therefore the causal patch has also the nite radial extension r  0 R
The static observer Bob is located inside the cosmological Horizon at a point suciently
far from it To congurate our principal thought experiment now consider an ingoing
radial light ray which is released at rin  R   with   R in the proximity of the
cosmological horizon at the initial time t  tin and so propagates toward the distantly
located Bob who much later receives those modes at the spacetime event Pr t with
r  R p3  H 1 The trajectory of the radial light ray can be written in the form
 cid181 
r2cid19
The integrated trajectory given the required initial condition is
t  tin  1
2H cid18log
1  Hr  log
1  Hrin
1  Hinrcid19  1
So the relation between the Bobs observed frequency and the initial frequency is given by
r  H 1  incid181  H 2r2
1  H 2r2cid1912
 in 2H12  2 in eHttin
Now by repeating the same analysis we performed in the case of black hole horizons we
nd in exactly the same way that the spectrum of the modes received by Bob follows the
distribution
f 2 cid20exp
  1cid211
which in terms of the energy quanta is a Planckian power spectrum at Hawking temperature
which is the result initially obtained in 4
As a followup
let us be back again to the example of the Schwarzschild de Sitter
spacetime that we considered in the previous chapter and redo the analysis we did there
for the light rays which propagates toward the interior observer from the near cosmological
event horizon Considering an ingoing light ray which starting from a point very close to
the outer event horizon rin  rC   the trajectory would have the following form
r  t  tin   Ln
And so the frequency  will be related to the initial frequency in at rin by
rH  r  rC  incid18 2
rCcid1912
 inexpcid18t  tin  r

Therefore we will obtain a Planckian power spectrum dened at the temperature

B Rindler Observer And Hawking Modes
Now we come to our second canonical example namely the Hawking radiation of
the Rindler horizon Besides the highlighted points that we briey explained in the
beginning of this chapter on the signicance of understanding the microscopic theory of the
observer based horizons in particular the Rindler horizon as possibly the simplest model
theory there is still one more dimension into the distinguished relevance of the Rindler
spacetime to be mentioned This important aspect is the fact that for a large variety of
phenomenologically interesting black holes the near horizon region is given by the Rindler
spacetime Therefor methodologically speaking the correct microscopic understanding of
the Rindler quantum information theory might be a rescaled basis for the the full theory
Naturally assuming that the microscopic theories of all the causal horizons must be the
same then this near-horizon Rindler-ness may suggest an intrinsic self-similarity in
the underlying microscopic theory of black holes
Here we apply our root-methodology to study the semiclassical spectral behavior of
the Hawking modes released by a Rindler horizon Because we have earlier discussed this
case based on the equivalence principle our presentation in here would be brief
Consider a congruence of worldlines for a family of observers moving with constant
acceleration a in Minkowski spacetime In terms of the conventional coordinates  
parametrizing this family of worldlines 14 the metric takes the form
ds2  dt2  dx2  1  a2d 2  d2
The right-hand side form of the above metric denes the Rindler spacetime In fact the
proper coordinate system is incomplete and covers only a quarter of the Minkowski spacetime
x  t therefore one of its Rindler wedges Indeed this is the subdomain of Minkowski
spacetime which is causally accessible to a uniformly accelerated observer namely it is
the causal patch of the accelerating observer bounded by the corresponding observer-based
causal horizon The Rindler observer perceives this causal horizon at proper distance a1
Therefore because of the presence of a causal horizon for the Rindler observer we may
anticipate that there must be a typical Hawking emission associated to it Let us apply our
directly observe-based method to see if this intuition is correct and if so then obtain the
spectral behavior of the distantly propagated Hawking modes To address this question we
consider as before a radial light ray which propagates from in  a1   at   in to
an observer located in the spacetime position    where   a1 and   a1 The
trajectory of such radial light rays is given by the equation
so that by the required initial condition the integrated trajectory will be
 1  a

logcid181  ain

So the observed frequency  at   a1   will be related to initial frequency in at

Now very similarly this Planckian spectrum for the observed Hawking modes is obtained
which corresponds to the Hawking temperature

THE 1ST MOVEMENT

VI UNITARITY HOLOGRAPHY AND HORIZONS
A The Unitarity of Information Processing In Bobs View
 The Paradox
Suppose that an asymptotic observer Bob is monitoring in all-details the entire history
of a well-dened physical event in which a large black hole is formed out of a suciently
high-energy initial scattering or from the gravitational collapse of some suciently massive
quantum matter The so-formed black hole then evaporates very softly but continually
by releasing the quantum-sourced Hawking modes in the proximity of its stretched horizon
until nally it becomes all-annihilated into the totality of an asymptotic Hawking radiation
collectable by Bob By the largeness of the black hole we mean that the radius of the
initially-formed horizon to be called the primal horizon is so enormous in Planck units
that no quantum gravitational corrections would matter at the horizon scale up until the
horizon becomes of the Planckian sizes suciently-close to its total evaporation To have
the right setting for the information paradox we also assume that the initial state of the
quantum matter is set to be and does stably remain to be in a pure state before the
primal horizon is being formed That is we take that the von Neumann entropy of the
total quantum system in the pre-horizon-era vanishes as an initial-state condition
S Initial State
von Neumann  0
Now let us see from Bobs information-theoretic view the post-horizon-formation era
Bobs main assumption is that the evolution of the black hole from the initial scattering
or collapse to its total annihilation is microscopically processed in a way that is completely
consistent with all the structure and the laws of quantum physics
Indeed given all his
experiences in string theory and quantum gravity he does not have any serious evidence or
even any signicant motive to postulate any statement in contradiction to this assumption
To the other extreme he does have a large manifold of evidences for this one assumption
For example all black holes which are addressable by the AdSCFT correspondence are
conrmed to be so Bob will so be assuming that this quantum gravitational phenomenon
evolves in consistency with the unitary dynamics of a quantum system A unitary dynamics
preserves the information so all the information bits that identify the exact initial-state
of the pre-horizon quantum system must be indestructible
The delicate central question to be addressed as of now is if the must-be unitarity of the
information processing is indeed validated by Bob To the asymptotic observations of Bob
the so-formed horizon behaves by all means as a thermal physical membrane to which a
thermodynamical entropy the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy equal to one quarter of its area
in Planck units is associated
A Horizon
Because now a quantum-nite positive entropy has suddenly developed in the gravitational
system Bob must be immediately concerned if the principle of information indestructibility
is being held due to the dening relation between entropy and information Fortunately
by simply recollecting and utilizing the very dening virtue of a black hole he gets the right
clue out of this worry A black hole is a maximally entropic gravitating system entirely
enclosed by a spacetime hypersurface the horizon that acts as a causal boundary to all the
events in the complementary part of the spacetime geometry As such the internal system
of the black hole that which is localized in the horizons interior is causally disconnected
from the asymptotic Bob and so does not belong to his own causal patch Now by merely
utilizing this conceptual point Bob understands that the demand for the indestructibility
of the information bits becomes equivalent to the following statement
The thermodynamical Bekenstein-Hawking entropy 68 associated to the primal horizon
now being interpreted as the holographic statistical entropy of the horizon-interior system
must necessarily count the total number of black holes microstates to be exact-equal to the
total number of the initial-state information bits
Let the integer
N which is taken to be a suciently large number denote for us
the total number of the initial-state information bits
Then in Bobs view the principle of information indestructibility becomes these statements
N  I Initial State
S Primal Horizon  I Initial State
A Primal Horizon  4l2
As implied by the principal equalities 7071 Bob also concludes that the initial-state
information build up bit by bit the total Hilbert space of the primal black hole by a one
to one mapping that takes those bits to the black hole microstates that is
dimH Primal Black Hole  dimH Primal Horizon  exp I Initial State   eN
So far so good But as Bob also experimentally conrms by his detector the primal horizon
is quantum unstable
It decays by quantum vacuum uctuations in the proximity of the
stretched horizon It so shrinks very very softly but monotonically by a continual release
of the Hawking modes As the horizon decays such the dimension of the black holes Hilbert
space H Interior also shrinks in accordance with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula
But then after this evaporation process is completed once mrs the entirety of the spacetime
geometry becomes causally connected Therefore Bob will be able to check whether the
initial-state information are all preserved upon collecting the totality of the nal-state
asymptotic Hawking modes Now to manifest the core of the problem let us see how the
dimension of H Interior
would shrink upon the release of a spectrally-typical Hawking mode Also to be more
 at an arbitrary time t after the formation of the primal horizon
specic let us consider the case of a Schwarzschild black hole in four spacetime dimensions
in the rest of this study knowing that an obviously similar analysis goes through in other
spacetime dimensions or for more complicated geometries At a time t of this quantum
evaporation process the horizon-interior system and the exterior spacetime geometry can
be suciently-well described by those of a Schwarzschild geometry which is endowed with a
very-slowly varying time-dependent mass Mt together with its corresponding quantities
for the horizon radius Rt the temperature T t and the black hole entropy SInteriort
Rt  2l2
 T t   1t 
 SInteriort  4l2
p M 2t
Now let us suppose that at about this time t one spectrally-typical Hawking mode is
released The emission of this quanta reduces the entropy of the interior black hole system
by the following amount
S Interiort  t   HMt
in which HMt denotes the energy of the released Hawking mode at the emission time t
Being spectrally thermal the emitted Hawking mode is of the energy
HMt  T t
and so from 74 we learn that
Namely each typical Hawking mode once being released carries away one unit of entropy
from the black hole Combining this with the unitarity conditions 7071 we obtain
SInteriort  1
S Interiort  N  N t
dimHinteriort  eN N t
with N t denoting the total number of the Hawking modes released-out up until a time
t after the formation of the primal horizon Of course we know that the released Hawking
modes need not to be all exactly-typical but only spectrally Planckian mostly carrying O1
entropies However doing a statistically more careful analysis with all details included we
would get the same result for S Interiort as stated above From 7778 Bob concludes that
the primal black hole will be all annihilated after radiating out a total number of N thermal
Hawking quanta namely as many as the total number of the initial-state information bits
Now let us suppose that Bob does patiently his monitoring for an enormously-long time
scale which turns out to be of the order of N
2  until the primal black hole gets entirely
quantum-annihilated
If so then thenal state of the system would be an asymptotic
radiation characterized by a thermal density matrix  dened at the temperature
T  4lp1N  1
whose von Neumann entropy S  Tr log equals to
S Thermal State
Asymptotic Radiation  N
and whose expectation value of the total number-operator as well equals to the same N
Now such a quantum many body system in which the von Neumann entropy satires its
upper bound in being equal to the total number of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the
system must be in the thermal version of the maximally uncertain quantum state which
is information-theoretically contentless That is the nal state we be such
I Final State
Thermal State  0
That would then mean that all the initial-state bits of information would have been lost
in a maximum violation of unitarity This enormous quantum information mismatch does
clearly call Bob for a resolution
B Geometric Planckianity And The Optimal Jumbler
 The Microscopic Theory
To be able to correctly resolve the afore-explained quantum information mismatch
which would violate unitarity as enormously as possible
it would be most natural to
begin with correctly pinpointing the exact origin of the spectral Planckianity of the
asymptotically-observed Hawking radiation as the very rst step There in the very origin
of the problem is the key to the solution
In the part A of this study we addressed this question by a root methodology
which was in physical speculations and the underlying assumptions was most minimalistic
and as an observer-centric approach was both conceptually and operationally most direct
We also veried the generality and stability of that method by scanning over a broad class
of causally-nontrivial spacetimes that collectively constituted a landscape of all the major
deformations What we methodically demonstrated and empirically validated as being a
general physical theorem is the following statement
An initial-state system of the near-horizon mono-frequency Hawking modes becomes a
nite-state system of the spectrally-Planckian multi-frequency Hawking modes merely as
the direct geometric result of the geodesic propagation of the frequency modes through the
so-curved continuum of the asymptotic observers causal patch
Now to advance further this result of the part A we must rst appreciate that
this maximal dispersion of the frequency modes is equivalent to the quantum-information
mismatch itself That is the information loss is the very semiclassical observation that
even if the initial system of the near-horizon frequency modes is prepared in a pure
quantum state its geometrically-driven nal-state system of the asymptotic frequency
modes
is found to be in a Planckian-prole
mixed quantum state As we found
there this maximal dispersion of the frequency modes is a characteristically classical
geometric eect which disturbs a microscopic quantum system
The underlying
quantum-ness of the aected system is because not only the modes are quantum-released
but also they inter-process an almost-thermalization whose temperature is -proportional
Having known those basic points we are nally at the right stage to pinpoint the
correct origin of the information paradox The nal picture will become transparent in
several steps Let us primarily ask the following question
How namely by which underlying microscopic mechanism
is that conversion of
the initial system of the near-horizon mono-frequency modes into a nal system of the
spectrally-Planckian multi-frequency asymptotic modes can be caused
In answering this question this much of the microscopic mechanism is clear That
which operates on the quantum system of frequency modes and maximally disperses them
must be the classical limit of a geometric environment In a better wording the frequency
modes constitute an open quantum system interacting with the quantum environment of
some characteristically-geometric degrees of freedom so that as the collective outcome
of this environment-system entanglement in a certain classical environmental limit the
geometric eect by which the modes are optimally dispersed can be simulated Being so
we will be calling this optimally-dispersing environment the Optimal Jumbler
As the next move forward we must formulate the global structure of an associated
Hilbert space scheme which quantum microscopically formulates this physical picture we
have been led to First at any arbitrary time during the horizon evaporation there is one
Hilbert space accounting for the totality of the already-released Hawking modes which as
an evolving open quantum system must be itself tensor-factorially accommodated into
a total Hilbert space dening an entire closed quantum system Let us highlight that we
dene this total Hilbert space for the smallest set of the microscopic degrees of freedom
which can be consistently treated as a closed system in Hawking evaporation So
Hawking Modes t HMinimum
As Ht
Hawking Modes denes all the Hawking modes available in the Bobs causal patch up
until a time t after the the formation of the primal-horizon its dimension is increasing as
far as the black hole evaporation goes on Therefore in 82 the left-hand side is explicitly
time-dependent but the right-hand side is static
Next being back to 82 we frame the subsystem complementary to the Hawking Modes
H Complementary
t HMinimum
and in accordance with the physical description given before demand that it must develop
the Optimal Jumbler in a specic environmental limit
As a marked note
let us already clarify a point of
foundational
importance By
thinking more fundamentally and more ambitiously one may begin the formulation of the
theory with doing better than cutting the dening frame of the total microscopic system
down to the so-minimalistically dened HMinimum
dened to be the smallest possible Hilbert space that can be consistently identied as a
 Let us remember that HMinimum
closed quantum system which accommodates all  the Hawking modes ever released-out
into the asymptotic-observer Bobs causal patch during the entire evolution Although
a minimum frame-cut for the total system clearly brings some advantages in order to
be having a more fundamental more unied and in fact a better detailedly-xed theory
it would be much better for us to instead begin the formulation with a more natural
identication of the H Total which turns out to be a much much bigger state-space than
HMinimum
 To see better this central point we must remember that our principal
methodology in dening quantum gravity is being fundamentally observer-centric which
in this context means that we must entirely take the physical stance of the asymptotic
observer Bob and so then try to develop a complete microscopic theory of evolving horizons
as he would do in his suciently-large causal diamond That is we must redene the
total microscopic system of this scenario to be any or a smallest choice of the Bobs causal
diamonds which accommodates the entire history of the evolution of the black hole from the
initial high-energy scattering or collapse to the completion of its Hawking emission 23 33
Because a causal diamond must be physically treated as a consistent closed universe 27
the Hilbert space of Bobs causal diamond denes the Theory of Everything the TOE
for his causal universe in which HMinimum
Here we will limit our analysis to the HMinimum
to consult the forthcoming work on Bobs unied theory 33 Let us simply restate that in
 is placed as a much smaller sub-theory
-theory and refer the interested readers
that theory the relation 82 is being completed with the following one
 H Bob
HMinimum
Now let us be back to the dening relation 83 and ask the following important question
What is the physical identity of the microscopic degrees of freedom dened by H Complementary
To answer to this question correctly we need to understand more clearly the ne-grained
microscopic nature of the classical geometric mechanism which
in the coarse-grained
collective way that was found in the part A disperses the initial system of mono-frequency
Hawking modes into a nal system of spectrally-Planckian modes The AHA experience is
simply realized by recollecting that this environmental dispersing mechanism is developed
as the direct eect of the background curvature of the asymptotic-observer Bobs causal
patch on the beams of Hawking modes which are propagating away from the null horizon
As such the underlying ne-grained structure is inversely obtained by deconstructing the
background curvature of Bobs causal diamond with a null-horizon causal boundary down
to a Hilbert space of quantum curvature modes which build up that geometric environment
Being translated and promoted into an exact statement about the Hilbert space systems
dened by the relations 8283 we are led to the following principal identication
H Complementary
evaporation process must be physically identied as the Hilbert space of the entirety of
 dened by the relations 8283 at any given time t of the Hawking
microscopic degrees of freedom that build up thecurvature of the asymptotic-observer
Bobs causal diamond with a null-horizon causal boundary at the corresponding time t 
That is
H Complementary
 HCausal Diamond
Bobby Curvature Modes t  H Bobby Causal Curvature
In accordance to this principal physical identication we will be calling the degrees of
freedom of H Bobby Causal Curvature
 the Bobby curvature modes
From the identication 85 together with the relations 83 and 82 we learn that
our minimum-total Hilbert space admits the following tensor-factorial decomposition as
an exact equality which must hold at any time during the entire Hawking evaporation

In the rest of this paper we will be referring to the quantum many body system which
is dened by the triplet system of Ht

 the
Having known the physical identication 85 and the Hilbert space structure 86 now
we must revisit the Optimal-Jumbler Correspondence demand which we introduced earlier
and so dissect its dening physical conditions Let us rst restate that demand as follows
Optimal Jumbler   A Specic Semiclassical Limit of The Quantum Triplet st 
Optimal Jumbler cid16H Bobby Causal Curvature
cid17 In That Specic Semiclassical Limit
So then we ask What physical conditions do identify the Optimal Jumbler Limit as being
phrased in the correspondence demand 87 The question
in better wording is the
following What are the necessary and sucient conditions to be imposed on the quantum
many body system dened by our Hilbert space triplet so that the Optimal Jumbler limit
of the demand 87 is actualized
The correct answer is being manifested in just two steps
First
it is so manifest
from the instrumental relations between the initial frequencies versus the nal frequencies
in all the examples we studied in the part A that the optimal Jumbling of the Bobby
bulk Hawking modes is environmentally developed by the direct eect of the background
curvature of the Bobs causal patch only because an exponentially-enhanced redshifting
is being imposed on the propagating modes by the very presence of the corresponding causal
horizon That is the Planckian-type dispersion of the propagating modes requires as a
necessary condition that the Bobs causal geometry has been curved in the presence of a
null causal screen
In fact one reason for our explicitness in choosing the name Bobby
Causal Curvature in 85 and 86 was to make this point crystal clear Therefore by
implementing this basic understanding into the exact microscopic physics of the Hilbert
space triplet we now state the rst necessary condition for the actualization of the
specic semiclassical limit that corresponds to the Optimal Jumbler 
semiclassical
C1 
Ht
this triplet corresponds to a quantum many body system that consistently denes and
Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal Curvature
if as the rst necessary condition
Optimal
HMinimum
Jumbler Limit
actualized
all-correctly accounts for the curved geometry of the suciently large causal diamond of
an asymptotic observer which has as its causal boundary the null horizon
But this necessary condition is not yet a sucient one Namely based on the universally-
veried lessons we took from the analyses of the part A of this study we still need one
more condition to impose on the triplet system for the Optimal Jumbler to be actualized by
it This second necessary condition will be the direct quantum microscopic implementation
of the following statement into the Hilbert space triplet
The geometric Planckianity of the Optimal Jumbler abstractly and microscopically
understood as the Planckian-optimal spectral-dispersion of the frequency modes of an
open quantum system can be actualized only in the strict thermodynamic limit of its
quantum environment dened and constituted by the Bobby Curvature Modes
Here the thermodynamic limit or the continuum limit
is meant exactly as in the
classical or quantum statistical physics of many body systems namely the exact limit in
which the total number of the microscopic degrees of freedom of the system goes to innity
In accordance
the second necessary condition for the microscopic actualization of the
Optimal Jumbler Limit is stated as follows
C2 
The Optimal Jumbler can be actualized by the triplet quantum system 86
only and only in the strict thermodynamic limit of the environment of the Bobby
Curvature Modes
dim H Bobby Causal Curvature
 Optimal Jumbler Limit   
Therefore for the Bobby-bulk geometry of a spacetime possessing a quantum-evaporating
horizon to jumble the initial-state bits of information to the Planckian eect with or
without the graybody factors or all the other perturbative corrections included in it both
of the conditions  C1 and  C2 must be simultaneously actualized by the quantum triplet
However it is simply a matter of paying enough attention to the physical content of the
condition C1 to become clear about the following fact
Fact Once the Hilbert space triplet Ht
Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal Curvature
validates the condition  C1 then the condition  C2 can not be actualized by it
HMinimum
How do we most clearly see that a microscopic validation of C1 
invalidates C2  
By simply applying the universal statements of holography 25 and as well the Jacobsons
re-derivation of the Einsteins equations 26 to the Bobby-causal type congurations as
phrased in the exact statement of C1  it is being concluded that for the quantum many
body system dened by the Hilbert space triplet to realize the condition C1  it must
satisfy the following holographic demand on the dimension of the total quantum system
dimH primal Horizon  exp
A Primal Horizon
  eN  dim HMinimum
Now although the right hand side of the holographic equality 89 can be arbitrarily large
must be always a nite value Indeed the area of the primal horizon in Planck units can
be taken as giant as we want but it should always be nitely large for one reason at least
simply because the strict limit of an innite horizon radius is physically inconsistent with
the co-presence of an asymptoticly far observer Bob to collect and to analyze the asymptotic
Hawking radiation Because of this strict niteness and by utilizing the equalities 83
and 85 which identify H Bobby Causal Curvature as a subspace of HMinimum
 we conclude
dim H Bobby Causal Curvature
    t
This does contradict 88 which is the statement of the necessary condition C2  This
proves that a simultaneous validation of the two necessary conditions of an optimal jumbler
environment for the horizon released Hawking modes the conditions C1  and C2  is
physically impossible Therefore we have learned the following lesson
A holographically correct
H Bobby Causal Curvature can never be an optimal
jumbler
Therefore the unitarity of the information processing in the Hawking evaporation of the
causal horizons is guaranteed if holography is implemented microscopically - as it must
It may be worth to highlight on one independent point We have been explicit in
the condition C2 on the statement that the optimal jumbler can only be actualized if
the Bobby curvature environment is innitely large in its microscopic degrees of freedom
This point may deserve a distinct attention By naturally taking this statement beyond
its specic quantum gravity context into quantum information theory
it becomes an
information theoretic conjecture which we do propose
information theoretic conjecture is the abstract general
statement
Planckian-eect dispersion of any set of frequency modes in any subsystem of a given total
closed system can not physically happen as far as the total system is nite dimensional
By the term Planckian-eect dispersion here we collectively mean any environmentally
sourced dispersion of frequency modes which is of the Planckian type incorporating the
possible graybody factors and any possible type of perturbative quantum corrections in it
We should also note that this information theoretic statement is consistent with the Page
phenomenon which is generic to the nitely-large quantum many body systems 31
let us be back to the central subject of this section and restate our main
conclusion
In short we have learned that the optimal jumbler can only be actualized
in a limit of Bobs causal-curvature environment that is holographically illicit Therefore
there can never be any information loss in holographic microscopic systems
C The Holographic Way To Quantum Gravitational Unitarity
Finally we are at the right stage to clarify in more details how holography must be
implemented into the observer-centric microscopic theory of the triplet quantum many body
system Ht
total system of a quantum-evolving causal horizon during its entire history
Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal Curvature
 which formulates the minimum
HMinimum
Naturally anticipated
it becomes manifest that the correct microscopic theory of the
Hawking-evaporating horizons as described in the asymptotic observer Bobs causal patch
is being formulated based on an intrinsically-holographic quantum duality between the
horizon-interior system and the causally-independent system of Bobby curvature modes
That in one way or another the quantum systems in the interior  and the exterior  of
a causal horizon must be physically mirroring one another is a major idea in quantum
gravity that dates back to the seminal papers which proposed the principle of observer
complementarily 21 Indeed the quantum duality known as observer complementarity
nds its deepest roots in the black hole information physics which is the core subject of this
study as well
Back then it was shown that for consistently joining the natural postulate of the quantum
unitarity of the Hawking evaporation process with the equivalence-principle demand of the
empty-space vacuum-ness of the horizon to the infalling observers observation we must
also postulate a quantum duality between a dening pair of Hilbert spaces in the interior
and in the exterior of the causal horizon However many physical and mathematical details
of the corresponding duality map have been a matter of both minor and major revisits
up until present 21 which must be yet discovered Here we state and utilize our distinct
version of this inside-outside duality The duality that we frame here will also be at the
level of an exact equivalence between a pair of Hilbert spaces in the two causal sides of the
horizon but the detailed duality map between the degrees of freedom on both sides will be
an interesting theme for future works The exact foundation of this inside-outside duality
proposal will be unfolded from rst principles by the forthcoming conjectural paper 33
Here we will briey elaborate on the reasoning behind this proposal and then exactly state
and utilize it
Let us remember that H Bobby Causal Curvature
all the Bobby curvature modes at the given time namely it is the system of all those
is by denition the quantum system of
degrees of freedom that microscopically build up the time-t curvature of the causal
patch of an asymptotic observer Bob who is monitoring the entire evolution of the horizon
Let us also remember that the evolving horizon monotonically shrinks by a slow release
of Hawking modes into the Bobs causal patch so that the black holes mass continually
decreases up until it vanishes entirely
In accordance the curvature of the Bobs causal
geometry which is directly sourced by the decreasing mass of the black hole
is also
being driven to vanish softly but monotonically For example in our canonical model
the bulk spacetime curvature is simply modeled by that of the Schwarzschild metric with
a monotonically-decreasing time-dependent mass prole is it Now it is holographically
clear that the total number of the Bobby curvature modes must be counted by the area in
Planck units of the causal horizon monodically decreasing from its initial value N to zero
Therefore let us introduce a one-parameter family of integers that serve as a holographic
measure of the time-dependent area of the evaporating horizon in Planck units
Nt 
Horizon Areat
 Nt  N  t
Now the dimension of the Hilbert space of the curvature modes is given by
dim H Bobby Causal Curvature
  eN t
which evolves in accordance with the following boundary conditions on Nt 
N0  N  I Initial State
 Nt  t  0
with t denoting the time when the evaporation is completed
Indeed
on the account of
the to-be proposed inside-outside duality
there is
the triplet
another Hilbert space which although is dened all-independently of
Ht
the exact same dimension at any time during the entire evolution of the horizon Obviously
Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal Curvature
 and does not belong to it directly has
HMinimum
by the rst statement of holography 25 this denition-wise independent Hilbert space is
that which denes the microstates of the black hole in the interior of its causal horizon
That is one has this all-time valid holographic equality of dimensions
dim Ht
Horizon Interior   eN t  dim H Bobby Causal Curvature
This holographic equality of dimensions for two independently-dened Hilbert spaces which
belong to a pair of causal-complementary regions of the same global spacetime signals
that they may be also a much deeper physical connection between them This anticipation
turns out to be indeed credential and all that it takes to unfold its physical statement is
to pinpoint yet another instrumental role played by holography for the physics of horizons
The central holographic point is that we have a setting in which one same holographic
is commonly shared by the two geometrically-regional quantum theories
screen 25
that are dened by Ht
Bobby Causal Curvature On one hand the quantum
system of black hole microstates living on Ht
Horizon Interior possesses as its system-dening
holographic screen the causal boundary of the horizon interior  which is identical to its
Horizon Interior and Ht
region dening topological boundary namely the horizon surface On the other hand
Bobs TOE  which includes the complete quantum gravitational physics of his causal patch
is also an intrinsically-holographic theory 27 Namely Bobs TOE which lives on H Bob
introduced before
TOE
is dened based on the holographic screen of any suciently-large
causal diamond that accommodates the entire evolution of the horizon
As Bobs holographic screen whose area in Planck units must be at least of the order of
2  will be enormously larger that the primal horizon whose holographic size is N
we may initially think that it should have nothing to do with the primal horizon which is
the holographic screen for the the theory of black hole microstates albeit apart from an
uninteresting big-theory sub-theory relationship But in fact the correct physics is going
to be fruitfully dierent 33 As it will be shown there from rst principles one has a
physically beautiful meaningful and well-dened sense in which the entire Bobs TOE is
perfectly reducible in its black hole sector to the the very total system of our quantum
triplet namely the minim-total theory living on HMinimum
by the primal horizon as 89 Now the HMinimum
theory dened on H Bobby Causal Curvature
Bobs causal diamond This subsystem theory whose dimension is being holographically
 which accounts for the curvature modes living in
quantum theory has in it a subsystem
 whose dimension has been set
counted by the area in Planck units of its region-dening-topological causal boundary as
in 92 must be by itself a well-dened holographic theory Obviously and unavoidably
the system-dening holographic screen for the H Bobby Causal Curvature
evolving horizon The clear conclusion is the following statement
theory is the time-t
The two holographic quantum theories living on Ht
Horizon Interior and H Bobby Causal Curvature
being a pair of causally-independent quantum many body systems which nevertheless share
one same system-dening holographic screen are quantum dual to one another and so
their exact Hilbert space physics must be duality-wise mappable to one another That is
the following statement of inside-outside duality does exactly hold
Dual Horizon Interior  H Bobby Causal Curvature
Based on the all-time-exact outside-inside duality 95 the internal degrees of freedom
that microscopically construct the time-dependent black hole system in the horizon in-
terior and the quantum curvature modes in the causal patch of the asymptotic observer
Bob are mapped to and are exactly reconstructable from one other similar to 21 One
point to be highlighted here is that this pair of systems in the inside and in the outside
are always holographic-subsets of the total microscopic degrees of freedom that dene the
primal horizon To have a more complete view of the foundations and physical discussions
of the proposed inside-outside duality we refer to the forthcoming study 33
Now what about the open quantum system of the Hawking modes living in the Bobby bulk 
Because the two quantum systems living on Ht
complementary pairs of our quantum triplet whose total-system dimension is statically
xed by 89 and given that the time-dependent dimension of H Bobby Causal Curvature
by the equality 92 we learn that the total dimension of the Hawking-mode subsystem
Hawking Modes and H Bobby Causal Curvature
 is set
 are
evolves as follows
dim Ht
Hawking Modes   expN  Nt  eN t
With The Boundary Conditions 
N 0  0  N t  t  N  I Initial State
According to the time-dependent dimension 96 as the horizon evaporates the subsystem of
the released Hawking modes expands in population from 0 to a total number of I Initial State
all-asymptotic modes once the horizon becomes entirely annihilated So as being mirrored
in 929396 in the process of horizon evaporation the initial I Initial State Bobby curvature
modes which themselves are manifested as out-projections of the horizon modes by the
holographic map become one-by-one converted into the lastly-all-asymptotic I Initial State
Hawking modes as the nal state of the system The extremely important point is that
as was holographically proved in the previous section during this holographic conversion
of the modes the initial-state bits of information are all indestructibly preserved and so are
being unitarily processed as the horizon evaporates Because of this holographic unitarity
the nal state of this evolving system will be in a pure quantum state that is in terms of
its von Neumann entropy it is characterized by the purity condition
S Final State
vonNeumann  0
I Initial State  I Initial State
Next let us describe with some more physical detailing how this purity of the nal state
of the Hilbert space triplet is processed in the form of a quantum many body system of
the N  I Initial State microscopic modes which by being holographically projected-out
live in the Bobby causal bulk We ask this same question both regional-wise namely
in terms of the spatial distribution of the modes and era-wise namely in terms of the
temporal phases of the quantum evolution of the horizon
As a highlighting foreword to the following discussion to be holographically in good
shape we better think of the primal horizon as a causal boundary which serves the
HMinimum
unstable brane Understood this way all the N  I Initial State microscopic modes that
-theory as its system-dening holographic screen but here more like an
constitute this minimum-total theory are fundamentally and identically the degrees of
freedom of the primal-horizon system which upon being projected-out into the Bobby
causal patch by the holographic map manifest as the Bobby curvature modes or the
Hawking modes albeit in an unitarily time-dependent interchanging manner
Let us begin with describing how the projected distribution of the microscopic modes goes
Regional-wise The Hilbert space triplet Ht
HMinimum
identies a total number of N microscopic degrees of freedom in the Bobs causal patch
Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal Curvature
which are subsystem-wise distributed among its interacting simultaneously evolving
complementary quantum subsystems H Bobby Causal Curvature
unitarily-driven Nt N t  N  Nt-prole The point is that the holographically
projected regional localization of these N degrees of freedom is done in a way that
 and Ht
Hawking Modes
characteristically distinguishes between the modes distributed in the two complementary
subsystems Let us see this characteristic dierence The H Bobby Causal Curvature
is constituted from the modes that by denition build up the curvature of the Bobs causal
-subsystem
patch So simply by their physical identication it is crystal clear that those modes must
have a radially-inhomogeneous distribution in the Bobby bulk That the localization of the
Nt Bobby curvature modes must be regionally marked with a radially-decaying prole
of the mode-density is manifested by the output-fact that the curvature-invariants of
the spacetime which must be directly built-up by them are radially enhanced by nearing
the horizon The most familiar example of this behavior is the Kretschmann invariant
of Schwarzschild spacetime with a 1r6-falling prole Moreover the distribution of the
Bobby curvature modes must be dominantly concentrated in a localization band  being
an order-one subregion of a so-named horizon nabe whose independent denition will
be soon given in what follows Not only the rapidly-decreasing power-law prole of the
curvature invariants shows this horizon-nearby dominance of the Bobby curvature modes
but also we will see a re-conrmation of this fact in the discussion below on the semiclassical
nite-distance spectrum of the Hawking modes
In contrast the Ht
Hawking Modes-subsystem is composed of the N t  N  Nt released
Hawking modes which are dynamically classied into two sub-groups of modes with
complementary regional localization and also distinct physical behavior To clearly see this
inter-grouping of Hawking modes in our observer-centric approach we must go back to the
principal analysis of the part A but this time redo it for an observer Bob who is located
in an arbitrarily nite distance from the horizon By the geometric mechanism with
which these modes become semiclassically jumbled  while propagating in the Bobby bulk
the following fact is clear Given a spacetime with a null causal horizon there must be a
nite crossover scale RC so that the emitted Hawking modes which propagate-away by
distances crossover-wise beyond this characteristic scale are observed by the local observer
Bob to be semiclassically Planckian dispersed up to unimportant nite-size corrections
In the mono-scale Schwarzschild spacetime RC can only depend on the horizon radius
and therefore it must be simply proportional to it namely RC  RH  N
in multi-sclae spacetimes it is still obvious that the most dominant dependence of RC
2  But even
must be carried by the horizon scale in the same linear manner Moreover being mainly
a result of the extremely dominant role that the exponential-redshifting virtue of the
null horizon plays in this semiclassical dispersion it can be shown that modulo all the
sub-leading dependences RC  a  RH  a  lp N
order-one To x a we will need the microscopic theory but its value is not important
2  with a being a constant typically of
to us Let us name the over-horizon region R  RC the horizon nabe and so the
region beyond it the asymptotic territory Now the fact that the semiclassical dispersion
of Hawking modes is being developed already in the nabe does reconrm that the Bobby
curvature modes are also concentrated in the nabe So we conclude that the dominant
regional distribution of the modes of the quantum triplet is of the form
H Bobby Causal Curvature
 H Nabe Curvature Modes
Hawking Modes
 Ht
Nabe Hawking Modes  Ht
Asymptotic Hawking Modes
Era-wise the quantum triplet system begins its unitary evolution in the pre-Page-time
during which an enormous environment of the nabe curvature modes interacts with the
nabe Hawking modes Then at a time scale of about the the Page time 31 the system
turns to its post-Page-time era during which the nabe curvature modes become a small
system of interacting defects among the released Hawking modes in the nabe
The system evolves unitarily until by a time scale of the order N
2  it ends up with
N  I Initial State asymptotic Hawking modes at Bobs disposal dening a pure nal state
Recollecting and joining all the stated points so far we obtain the following structure for
the triplet Bobby quantum many body system that holographically formulates the unitary
evolution of the quantum-evaporating causal screens

This separation of scales which is seen in the holographic projection of the microscopic
modes into the Bobby bulk must have a very meaningful reection back on their dening
root system namely the quantum many body system of the primal horizon which calls for
further research Clearly the detailed interactions and the exact unitary dynamics of 99
is still to be discovered This mission will begin to be developed from rst principles by 33
VII A BRIEF CONCLUSION
By an observer-centric methodology we claried that Hawking evaporation is protected
against any loss of the information bits unless we holographic-illicitly congurate the
system in the strict thermodynamic limit of the Bobby curvature modes So the correct
way-out of the information paradox turns out to be just the same as the correct way-in
to the very foundation of quantum gravity that is the way of holography Based upon
this we elucidated the physics of a microscopic holography that successfully realizes the
unitarity of information processing in quantum evolution of causal horizons
However the corresponding triplet quantum many body system summarized in 99
clearly needs to be advanced to become a complete microscopic description In particular
still there are three main aspects of this microscopic system to be known First the detailed
microscopic interactions between all the dierent sets of modes needs to be xed Second
the exact unitary operator that drives the dynamics of the entire system together with the
individual dynamics of each one of the evolving subsystems must be determined Third
we still need to unfold how the purity of the nal state of the system is being imprinted
on the ne-grained multimode quantum correlations of the Hawking modes
As a hint forward by the holographically-driven way in which Bobby curvature modes are
being dynamically converted into the Hawking modes and also by their holographic origin
as the identical microscopic degrees of freedom of the many body system of the primal
horizon as the Holographic screen it is very natural to anticipate that in the triplet
quantum system there must be an underlying scheme of impartial physical unication
between all those sets of modes Namely the fundamental microscopic description of the
system must be such that all the modes are being physically considered as identical entities
Moreover both from the principal methodology of this study and from several independent
quantum gravitational reasonings it becomes transparent that this fundamental holographic
microscopic formulation must be observer-centric in its very conception and formulation
Indeed it becomes transparent to us that by accommodating our triplet quantum system
into the following quintet quantum many body system
cid16 H Hawking ModesH Bobby Causal CurvatureHMinimum
H Bobby EnvironmentH Bob
TOE cid17
and further by axiomatically following a specic set of foundational physical principles one
can indeed accomplish the holographic fundamental unied theory as envisioned in here 33
