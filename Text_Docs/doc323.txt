ABSTRACT
Extremely Red Objects EROs oer a window to the universe at z  1 analogous
to that provided by the Lyman Break galaxies at z  3 Passive evolution and hi-
erarchical galaxy formation models make very distinct predictions for the K 22m
surface density of galaxies at z  1 and EROs are a powerful constraint on these the-
ories I present a study of nine resolved EROs with R  K  53 and K  18 mag
found in the 185 arcmin2 of the Deep Multicolor Survey with near-infrared imaging
Photometric redshifts for these galaxies shows they all lie at z  08  13 The rela-
tively blue J  K colors of these galaxies suggest that most are old ellipticals rather
than dusty starbursts The surface density of EROs in this survey  005 arcmin2
which is a lower limit to the total z  1 galaxy surface density is an order of magnitude
below the prediction of passive galaxy evolution yet over a factor of two higher than
the hierarchical galaxy formation prediction for a at matter-dominated universe A
at dominated universe may bring the hierarchical galaxy formation model into
agreement with the observed ERO surface density

Introduction
The most well-known modern method of using color selection to nd high-redshift galaxies
is the Lyman-break technique eg Steidel  Hamilton 1993 and this method has isolated large
numbers of galaxies at z  3 and z  4 Steidel et al 1996 1999 The great eciency of the
Lyman-break technique in selecting high-redshift candidates for follow-up spectroscopy from visible
wavelength colors has made it easier to preselect samples of z  3 galaxy candidates than galaxies at

z  1  2 A complimentary technique to preselect z  1 galaxy candidates is to use a combination
of near-infrared NIR and visible wavelength photometry to search for Extremely Red Objects
EROs which have large visibleNIR colors Elston Rieke  Rieke 1988 McCarthy et al 1992
A sample of galaxies at z  1 can test galaxy evolution theories by measuring both the surface
density of these galaxies and the relative fraction of dierent spectrophotometric types Hierarchical
galaxy formation predicts that present day massive galaxies assemble between z  1 and the present
eg White  Rees 1978 White  Frenk 1991 Lacey et al 1993 Baugh et al 1998 In contrast
the passive evolution model postulates that galaxies assembled at z  3 and the comoving space
density of bright galaxies at z  1 should be comparable to the local value eg Tinsley 1977
Bruzual  Kron 1980 Kaumann  Charlot 1998 showed that hierarchical galaxy formation
predicts a signicantly smaller fraction of z  1 galaxies in a K-selected redshift survey relative to
passive galaxy evolution Kband selection is particularly sensitive to dierences between these two
galaxy formation models because it measures the old stellar population that dominates the mass
rather than recent starbursts which may enhance the luminosity at visible wavelengths Several
K-selected redshift surveys have indeed found smaller numbers of z  1 galaxies than predicted
by passive evolution in support of the hierarchical galaxy formation picture Songaila et al 1994
Cowie et al 1996 Fontana et al 1999
Well-studied EROs to date are all at z  08 and appear to be either old ellipticals or dusty
starbursts However EROs are generally classied as ellipticals because their rest-frame visible
spectrum is dominated by an old stellar population rather than on the basis of kinematic or
surface brightness criteria Old ellipticals at these redshifts have very red colors because the 4000
A break falls between the R and K bands Dusty starbursts have similarly extreme colors due to
a combination of the Balmer continuum break and the relative suppression of the U V light from
young stars by dust The rst deep sky survey at K by Elston Rieke  Rieke 1988 found 2 EROs
which additional photometry and spectroscopy showed were old ellipticals at z  08 Elston Rieke
 Rieke 1989 Several more EROs were found by McCarthy et al 1992 in a K imaging survey
of the elds of high-redshift radio galaxies and two EROs were found by Hu  Ridgway 1994 in
an imaging survey of a z  3790 quasar eld One of these HR10 has a spectroscopic redshift of
z  144 and has since been detected at radio Graham  Dey 1996 and submillimeter Cimatti
et al 1998 Dey et al 1999 wavelengths These observations provide strong evidence that HR10
is a dusty starburst galaxy Another well-studied ERO LBDS 53W091 was discovered in a NIR
study of a sample of weak radio sources Spectroscopy by Spinrad et al 1997 showed that it is an
old red galaxy at z  155 Soifer et al 1999 observed the ERO Cl 09394713B serendipitously
discovered by Persson et al 1993 and found it is an old elliptical at z  158 The spectroscopic
observations of HR10 LBDS 53W091 Cl 09394713B and others show that EROs are at z  08
and either appear as old ellipticals or dusty starbursts
The denition of what constitutes an ERO is highly variable and cuts in color include R  K 
5 53 and 6 and I  K  4 Recent surveys for EROs have mapped large areas of the sky at NIR
wavelengths to statistically study the ERO population Thompson et al 1999 Yan et al 2000

Scodeggio  Silva 2000 Daddi et al 2000 Cimatti et al 1999 spectroscopically followed up a
sample of nine EROs and found that two are dusty starbursts and the remaining seven are consistent
with passively evolved ellipticals Cohen et al 1999 have obtained spectra of four of the 19 EROs
in the Caltech Faint Galaxy Redshift Survey and all appear to be ellipticals with little dust This
spectroscopic work indicates that most EROs are ellipticals rather than dusty starbursts While
the larger ERO samples only include imaging Daddi et al 2000 showed that the EROs in their
700 arcmin2 survey are strongly clustered and their surface density can be used to test galaxy
formation models The clustering of EROs helps to explain the dispersion in measurements of the
ERO surface density for a xed color and magnitude threshold
This survey for EROs is based on the visible and NIR imaging of the Deep Multicolor Survey
DMS described in Hall et al 1996a and Martini 2001 The original DMS included U BV RI75I86
photometry of 6 high-galactic latitude elds over a total area of 083 deg2 The DMS has been
used to study the luminosity function of quasars Hall et al 1996b Kenneck et al 1997 galactic
stars Martini  Osmer 1998 the luminosity function of galaxies Liu et al 1998 and NIR
J HK number counts Martini 2001 In this paper I discuss the nature of the nine objects with
R  K  53 and K  18 mag in the DMS and the implications of the ERO surface density for
galaxy evolution models 2 and 3 briey describe the photometry and object selection In 4 I
use colors and model ts to the 9-lter spectral energy distributions SEDs to compute redshifts
and classify the EROs as either ellipticals or dusty starbursts These results are discussed in 5
2 Photometry
The observations data reduction and photometric solutions for these observations are de-
scribed in Hall et al 1996a and Martini 2001 To measure the objects detected in the NIR
frames plate scale of 03 pix1 on the CCD data 0529 pix1 I used the DMS stellar catalog
Osmer et al 1998 to solve for the coordinate transformations using GEOTRANS in IRAF3 The
photometric zeropoints for each of the 21 elds was determined with the DMS stellar catalog for
the CCD images and the photometric solutions from Martini 2001 for the NIR images Because
the subelds with NIR data are small variations in the PSF across the CCD elds described by
Hall et al 1996a are negligible over these individual subelds For the CCD elds with more than
one NIR subeld the variation in the photometric zeropoint for dierent regions of the same CCD
image was 002 mag or less
I measured the brightness of each object using aperture photometry and a stellar-prole aper-
ture correction The main purpose of these measurements is to accurately determine the colors of
the galaxies rather than their total integrated brightness in each lter The same size aperture

Universities for Research in Astronomy Inc under cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation

will sample the same physical region in each galaxy and provide a better estimate of the shape of
the SED than methods such as isophotal magnitudes which will depend on the isophotal limit in
each lter Variations in seeing from lter to lter can complicate this issue as a larger fraction of
the light within a xed physical radius will fall outside the aperture if the seeing FWHM is larger
The optimal aperture for these measurements will be a compromise between a decrease in aperture
size which will increase the signal-to-noise ratio and an increase in the uncertainty of the stellar
aperture correction While the image quality is on average superior in the NIR frames relative to
the CCD data the NIR elds are signicantly smaller 9 arcmin2 compared to 225 arcmin2 and
generally only have one or two stars of sucient brightness to determine the seeing and aperture
correction The NIR frames were therefore the limiting factor in minimizing the aperture size To
derive the optimal aperture I measured the aperture correction in the NIR frames at a range of
radii from 05 to 4 I found that for R  2 the uncertainty in the aperture correction for many
of the frames was comparable or greater than the photometric errors at K  18 mag I therefore
chose to use an R  2 aperture for the photometry
To measure the amount of lost light from a galaxy in excess of the stellar aperture correction
I simulated measurements of exponential disks and r14 proles with half-light radii rh  025
05 075 and 1 over the range of seeing from 1 to 25 FWHM exhibited by these images
following the procedure described in Martini 2001 This range of possible ERO angular sizes span
that found by Moriondo et al 2000 in their study of EROs with HST imaging For an R  2
aperture the galaxy light lost in addition to the stellar aperture correction ranges from essentially
zero for rh  025 to 02 mag for an rh  1 exponential disk and 025 mag for an rh  1 r14
prole
3 Selection Criteria
NIR imaging surveys for EROs have dened numerous selection criteria Thompson et al 1999
Yan et al 2000 Scodeggio  Silva 2000 including objects with R  K  6 R  K  5 I  K  4
and K magnitude upper limits from 18 to 20 mag An extreme red color is a fairly ecient means
of selecting candidate galaxies at z  1 because it brackets the 4000 A break in ellipticals and
the Balmer continuum plus reddening in dusty starburst galaxies This color space could also be
inhabited by late-type stars emission line galaxies or very high redshift z  7 galaxies where
the Lyman continuum falls between R and K Stellar contamination is probably the dominant
contaminant in ERO samples and can be avoided by including only resolved sources The upper
limit in magnitude which is approximately the spectroscopic limit of the largest current telescopes
avoids contamination of the z  1 sample by galaxies at higher redshift as they have much lower
surface densities than z  1 objects at these magnitude limits For example a K  18 mag galaxy
at z  1 has an absolute magnitude MK  25  log h M  03   07 two magnitudes
brighter than MKz  0  23  log h Gardner et al 1997 The z  08 galaxies in a survey
to K  18 mag will therefore mostly be at z  2 due to the exponential decline in the galaxy
 5 
luminosity function
For this study I have adopted RK  53 K  18 mag to select for EROs in the DMS sample
The K  18 mag limit is brighter than at least the rh  025 completeness limit for nearly all
185 arcmin2 of the K survey Martini 2001 R  K  53 was suggested by Pozzetti  Mannucci
2000 based on models of ellipticals and dusty starbursts as well as observations of known EROs
at z  1 In total nine resolved objects in the DMS sample met these two selection criteria for
a surface density of 005 arcmin2 This surface density is a lower limit due to the variation in
detection eciency for dierent galaxy sizes and from eld to eld The photometry for the EROs is
listed in Table 1 The only correction that has been applied to the apparent magnitudes in Table 1
is a stellar aperture correction As these measurements may underestimate the total integrated
brightness this survey may underestimate the true ERO surface density see  5
4 Analysis
41 ERO Colors
Colors are one means of breaking the degeneracy between ellipticals and starbursts The SED
of an elliptical galaxy at z  1 drops o sharply at the 4000 A break between the R and K bands
while the SED of a dusty starburst declines more gradually due to reddening As discussed by
Pozzetti  Mannucci 2000 observations between the R and K bands such as I z J or H can
be used to measure the sharpness of the spectral break and thus discriminate between these two
scenarios By this argument ellipticals appear bluer in J  K than dusty starbursts Figure 1
shows R  K vs J  K for the galaxies in Table 1 open circles where ellipticals lie to the left
towards bluer J K colors and dusty starbursts to the right towards redder J K colors Pozzetti
 Mannucci 2000 convolved a range of models and observed galaxy spectral energy distributions
with R I J and H lters and found that ellipticals and dusty starbursts separate in the I  K
vs J  K plane and R  K vs J  K plane Their relation between R  K and J  K is shown in
Figure 1 along with their suggested R  K  53 selection criterion dotted lines This color space
does successfully classify three EROs from the literature with spectroscopic classications visible
and NIR photometry open triangles HR10 Graham  Dey 1996 LBDS 53W091 Spinrad et
al 1997 and CL09394713B Soifer et al 1999 It is possible however that galaxies with a mix
of old stars and dusty star formation could fall into either class on this diagram For example
Hall et al 2001 found evidence of this in their study of EROs associated with radio-loud quasars
where objects best t by star formation and dust still had relatively blue J  K colors Of the
nine DMS EROs shown in the Figure seven have colors consistent with elliptical galaxies and two
are consistent with dusty starbursts However six of the EROs fall within 1 of the dividing line
between these two classes and therefore either interpretation is consistent with the photometry

three EROs from the literature by open triangles The model by Pozzetti  Mannucci 2000 to
discriminate between ellipticals and dusty starbursts dotted line nearly equally divides the ERO
sample
42 SED Template Fits
Photometric redshifts with SED template ts are one way to expand on simpler color dis-
crimination techniques and solve for both the object redshift and spectrophotometric galaxy type
Photometric redshifts that t SED templates to photometric data rely on three pieces of informa-
tion a template SED for the source object the relative transmission of the system lter detector
and optics in each band and a measurement of the source brightness in that band Of these three
quantities the system transmission prole should be the best-known quantity in principle and
the true galaxy SED the most uncertain The templates used in photometric redshift codes are
either empirical SEDs such as the set compiled by Coleman et al 1980 or spectral synthesis tem-
plates such as those based on the Bruzual  Charlot evolutionary code eg GISSEL98 Bruzual
 Charlot 1993
Photometric redshift codes are most accurate in the z  1  2 range when NIR photometry is
available eg Gwyn 1995 Bolzonella et al 2000 At this range of redshifts the strongest spectral
 7 
feature the 4000 A break has shifted into the NIR region and the Lyman continuum has not
yet shifted into the ground-based U lter bandpass Using mock galaxy catalogs produced with
hyperz Bolzonella et al 2000 I measured the accuracy of the photometric redshift measurements
for a K  18 mag galaxy sample with the same magnitude limits and noise properties as this
survey in all nine lters For a uniform distribution in redshifts the scatter is z  008 The
scatter for galaxies with 08  z  2 is z  01 compared to z  03 for the same sample if only
U BV RI75I86 photometry were available The accuracy of photometric redshifts and the associated
best-t templates depends on photometric quality as well as the number of lters While the EROs
are all expected to be at z  08 due to their R  K colors they are often undetected in several
lters none are detected in U or B and the photometric uncertainties in the remaining lters
are generally  01 mag The larger the photometric errors the less well contrained the best-t
redshift and particularly the best-t galaxy template
The empirical galaxy templates in hyperz are from Coleman et al 1980 and represent the local
galaxy population The GISSEL98 galaxy templates are the 1998 update of the spectral synthesis
models described by Bruzual  Charlot 1993 All of the models have solar metallicity and a
Miller  Scalo 1979 initial mass function Each model corresponds to a dierent present-day
spectrophotometric galaxy type The elliptical template has all star formation occurring at high
redshift and thus represents classic passive luminosity evolution The burst model represents the
opposite extreme with signicant recent star formation The remaining galaxy types are represented
by exponentially decaying star formation with dierent efolding timescales
I used hyperz to nd the best-t empirical galaxy template GISSEL98 elliptical template and
GISSEL98 starburst templates for each of the EROs listed in Table 1 The basic operation of
this code is to take a series of input galaxy templates vary the redshift and amount of reddening
and solve for the best combination of these quantities that match an input catalog of photometric
measurements or upper limits For these model ts I adopted the Calzetti et al 2000 reddening
law While there are a large number of lters predened in hyperz the DMS I75 and I86 lters
are not included Because of the importance of the system transmission proles in each band I
added the proles of the DMS lters from Hall et al 1996a which include the detector response
and scans of the J H and K lters from TIFKAM which I convolved by a measurement of the
atmospheric transmission at Kitt Peak
In all cases the photometric redshift predictions of the three ts shown in Table 2 are similar
One feature of the SED ts to these EROs is that on average the best-t elliptical template has a
lower photometric redshift than the best starburst template This is because the dominant break
in the SED of elliptical galaxies is at 4000 A while the closest spectral break in starburst galaxies
is the Balmer continuum at 3650 A The rms scatter in the photometric redshift prediction for
these three ts is z  01 The photometric redshifts are thus quite robust and show clearly that
these EROs are z  08 galaxies The relative quality of the three SED ts is comparable with the
dierence between the ts 2
  1 These galaxies can therefore not be reliably classied as either
ellipticals or dusty starbursts due to the large photometric errors Most of the best ts with the
 8 
Fig 2 Best-tting SEDs for the EROs Each panel contains the observed photometry for an
ERO from Table 1 solid points with errorbars and the best-t empirical galaxy template solid
line from Coleman et al 1980
Coleman et al 1980 empirical SEDs are the elliptical template with no dust or spirals with some
dust These ts suggest that most EROs are ellipticals although old stellar populations at z  1
are on order half the age of old stellar populations at z  0 and thus this empirical SED may not
be an accurate representation of z  1 ellipticals The GISSEL98 models do take the change in the
age of the universe with redshift into account The GISSEL98 elliptical templates t the data with
only a small amount of extinction while the starburst models require on average AV  1 mag
5 Discussion
The reported surface density of EROs has a large dispersion Elston Rieke  Rieke 1988
found two galaxies with R  K  5 and K  18 mag in 10 arcmin2 for a surface density of
02 arcmin2 Figure 1 of Thompson et al 1999 shows they found seven of these objects for a
surface density of 005 arcmin2 Daddi et al 2000 surveyed 700 arcmin2 and derived a surface
density of 008 arcmin2 for R  K  5 and K  18 mag Their study also showed that EROs
are clustered which helps to explain the dispersion in measurements of the surface density
 9 
this survey I have identied nine EROs with R  K  53 and K  18 mag which corresponds
to a surface density of 00490022
0016 arcmin2 where these uncertainties only correspond to the 1
condence limits Gehrels 1986 This surface density is nearly a factor of two higher than the
surface density of 0027 arcmin2 found by Daddi et al 2000 for R  K  53 and K  18 mag
see Table 3 although based on Poisson statistics these measurements are marginally consistent
at the 1 level
In addition to the random errors due to counting statistics Eddington bias and light lost
outside the R  2 aperture could systematically lower and raise the measured surface density
respectively Eddington bias is important near the detection limit when objects with a steep
numbermagnitude relation are preferentially scattered into the sample and articially enhance the
observed space density Based on the surface density vs magnitude measurements published by
Daddi et al 2000 the slope of the ERO numbermagnitude relation for R  K  53 is   09
at K  18 mag The correction for the Eddington bias is  26522 and for a mean photometric
uncertainty of   01 the surface density may be overestimated by approximately 2 If the slope
were a factor of two steeper the overestimate is still less than 10 A more signicant potential
source of error arises if the EROs are large galaxies and a R  2 aperture misses some fraction of
their light Then the surface density has been underestimated as eectively the photometric scale
assigns them too faint a magnitude thus the surface density at K  18 mag is really the surface
density at K  18  m mag The increase in surface density scales as 10 m where for example
m  02 rh  1 for an exponential or r14 prole corresponds to an increase of 50 although
a signicant contribution from such large EROs appear to be ruled out by observations Moriondo
et al 2000
While clustering will not change the true mean surface density it will increase the possible
variation from survey to survey over the pure Poisson uncertainties quoted above The DMS EROs
are clearly strongly clustered as for example ve of these objects are in one of the subelds in
Field01W 01WC 01WC150W and CF3 only 20 of the total area with NIR data The rms
number counts of EROs in the DMS are   085 compared to Poisson  067 for a surface density
of 005 arcmin2 and an average area per eld of 9 arcmin2 If I adopt the correlation amplitude
A  0024 from Daddi et al 2000 for R  K  5 K  18 mag they had insucient statistics
to measure this quantity at R  K  53 the predicted rms counts Roche et al 1999 Daddi et
al 2000 are   075 The clustering signal in this suvey may be exaggerated by variations in the
eld to eld sensitivity
The high surface density of EROs in this and other surveys provides a constraint for passive
evolution and hierarchical galaxy formation models Hierarchical models predict relatively few
large bright galaxies at z  1 as most these galaxies assemble at z  1
In a simple test of
hierarchical galaxy formation Kaumann  Charlot 1998 predicted that less that 1 of all
galaxies with 16  K  18 mag are at z  08 and  10 of galaxies with 18  K  19 mag are
at z  08 see their Figure 4 Measurements of the K numbermagnitude relation eg Minezaki
et al 1998 Martini 2001 show the galaxy surface density is  17 arcmin2 for galaxies with
 10 
16  K  18 mag and  33 arcmin2 for galaxies with 18  K  19 mag As all EROs with
spectroscopic or photometric redshifts are at z  08 the surface density of EROs can be taken as
a lower limit to the surface density of all z  08 galaxies to test the Kaumann  Charlot 1998
prediction of hierarchical galaxy formation Their predicted fraction of galaxies at z  08 implies
that the surface density of EROs should be  0017 arcmin2 for 16  K  18 mag in conict
with the higher value I measure and the value measured by Daddi et al 2000 According the
passive evolution model in Kaumann  Charlot 1998  50 of all galaxies at K  18 mag are
at z  08 which corresponds to over an order of magnitude greater surface density of all z  08
galaxies than the ERO surface density presented here even if the ERO surface density has been
underestimated by as much as 50 due to lost light in the aperture
The ERO surface density I measure and also the measurement of Daddi et al 2000 is still
consistent with the results of K-selected spectroscopic and photometric redshift surveys Songaila
et al 1994 Cowie et al 1996 Fontana et al 1999 which have found a somewhat higher surface
density of z  08 galaxies than the hierarchical model predictions The cosmic variance between
dierent redshift and ERO surveys should be large given the clustering of EROs The redshift
distribution from a spectroscopic survey is also most likely to be incomplete for the reddest and
highest-redshift galaxies and could underestimate the z  1 contribution
EROs provide such a good means to test the hierarchical galaxy formation model because their
surface density is greater than the predicted surface density of all z  08 galaxies and they are
only a lower limit on the total z  08 galaxy population in a Kselected galaxy survey From
the discussion of the systematic uncertainties in the surface density above the overestimate due
to Eddington bias is less signicant than an underestimate due to lost galaxy light and therefore
005 arcmin2 may be a lower limit to the true ERO surface density The surface density is
therefore nearly a factor of three higher than the predicted surface density of all z  08 galaxies
Two other eects could bring the ERO surface density into better agreement with the hierarchical
prediction either by decreasing the observed number of EROs or increasing their expected number
Some fraction of EROs appear to be dusty starburst galaxies rather than old ellipticals While this
fraction is very likely less than 50 based on the colors of these EROs and spectroscopic observations
of ERO samples from the literature Cimatti et al 1999 Cohen et al 1999 decreasing the surface
density from this survey by a factor of two still yields a higher surface density of objects than
the hierarchical model A more important eect however is that the current model predictions
from Kaumann  Charlot 1998 are for an M  1 universe In a at dominated universe
which appears to be the best t cosmological model the comoving volume element vs redshift is
larger than in a at matter-dominated universe For example at z  1 a given surface area on
the sky corresponds to a factor of 28 hM h3 more comoving volume in an M  03   07
universe than in an M  1   0 universe The volume per unit area on the sky is greater
and implies a larger surface density of high-redshift objects than the matter-dominated model
considered by Kaumann  Charlot 1998 The growth factor is also larger at xed redshift in a
dominated universe than in an M  1 model which implies more large structures have formed
 11 
and consequently a larger space density and surface density of bright galaxies The increase in
surface density due to the change from a matter-dominated to a dominated universe is partially
oset however by the increase in the luminosity distance
In this paper I have presented a new measurement of the ERO surface density and used
photometric redshifts to show these objects are galaxies at z  08 The surface density of EROs
is a lower limit to the total z  08 surface density yet it is still a factor of three larger than
the hierarchical galaxy formation model prediction for a matter-dominated universe Hierarchical
galaxy formation in a dominated universe rather than a matter-dominated universe could
account for this discrepancy

Note  Surface density of EROs with R  K  53 Column 1 lists the two K magnitude
ranges and column 2 the surface density of all galaxies in this magnitude range from Martini
2001 The percent of all galaxies at z  08 in these magnitude ranges from the hierarchical
galaxy model prediction of Kaumann  Charlot 1998 is given in column 3 Column 4 lists
the expected surface density of galaxies at z  08 while columns 5  6 list the measured
surface density of EROs which are lower limits to the surface density of all z  08 galaxies
The measurements in these columns are higher than the hierarchical model predictions for
K  18 mag but are consistent with this model for 18  K  19 mag
