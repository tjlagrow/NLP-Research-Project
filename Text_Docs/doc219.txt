Abstract
The deepest multi-wavelength surveys now provide measurements
of star formation in galaxies out to z  1 and allow to reconstruct its history for
large parts of the galaxy population I review recent studies which have consis-
tently revealed a picture where galaxy star formation rates and their evolution
are primarily determined by galaxy mass Unless they undergo a quenching of
their star formation galaxies of similar masses have very similar star formation
histories which turn out to be relatively smooth star formation rates decline
with redshift in a primarily gradual manner while typical starburst episodes
have only a modest amplitude that barely evolves
I discuss how the found relations and their redshift evolution can provide
an observed reference star formation history as a function of galaxy mass
The observed amplitudes and timescales of galaxy star formation are not
fully reproduced by current theoretical models and are a promising testbed to
improve the assumed baryon physics However measurements of star formation
rates in distant galaxies need to be treated with caution Near-future data
methods and instruments will help us to improve on calibrations and sensitivities
for high redshift star formation
1 Star Formation and the Deep Multi-Wavelength Surveys
Star formation SF is responsible for most of those galaxy properties that we
can currently measure out to high z luminosities spectral energy distributions
morphologies Understanding the history and physics of SF is fundamental for
the understanding of baryons in galaxies and also for many other elds of astro-
physics the cosmic evolution of gas and metals the extragalactic background
light and cosmological tests that rely on galaxies clustering and number densi-
ties to illuminate the evolution of Dark Matter structure
Studies of SF histories have been dramatically advanced by the recent ar-
rival of deep multi-wavelength surveys like GOODS AEGIS and COSMOS
Their sensitivity allows to observe all galaxies down to masses below typical
L systems out to z  1 providing a comprehensive picture of their evolu-
tion Their variety of multi-wavelength data especially the Spitzer IRAC and
MIPS 24m data have much improved the measurements of SF rates SFR
and stellar masses M in distant galaxies where dust extinction corrections
are challenging to measure eg Daddi et al 2007
In the following I summarize the rst broad-brushed but comprehensive
and new picture of SF in eld galaxies that the deep surveys have just revealed
SF was predominantly not driven by an evolution of strong starbursts but gradu-

preceding decade that i the comoving SF rate SFR density of the Universe
has decreased by about an order of magnitude since z  1 Madau et al 1996

today and iii that the average SF history of galaxies is a strong function of

quence out to z  2
The evolution of SFR as a function of M and z is summarized in Figure 1
adapted from Noeske et al 2007a Shown are data from the AEGIS survey
from z  02 to 11 SFR are derived from Spitzer 24m photometry and
DEEP2 emission lines Weiner et al 2007 M from optical DEEP2 and NIR
photometry Bundy et al 2006 For other SFR tracers and calibrations the
results are consistent with small quantitative systematic dierences
The star-forming galaxies blue symbols predominantly late type morpholo-
gies mostly blue U  B colors segregate from those with no measurable SF
red symbols early types red U  B colors and the galaxies with weak emis-
sion lines that are likely to have some residual SF Schiminovich et al 2007 or

See the caption of Figure 1 or Noeske et al 2007a
Importantly the SF galaxies form a dened relation between SFR and M
over the whole z range with a spread in SFR at a given M and z that is
crudely log-normal with a 1 width of  03 dex after correction for minimal
estimates of SFR errors at all z Such a relation had been known at z  01
Brinchmann et al 2004 and its existence to z  1 Noeske et al 2007a was
conrmed by Elbaz et al 2007 Recently Daddi et al 2007 reported this re-
lation with a similar spread in SFR at z  2 cf also eg Forster Schreiber et al
2009 Detailed studies at z  01 are given in Schiminovich et al 2007 and
Salim et al 2007 While the scatter in SF remains roughly constant at all ob-
served z the above authors nd the SFR at a given M to decrease by a factor of
 620 from z  12 to 0 Noeske et al 2007a Elbaz et al 2007 Daddi et al
For reasons explained in Section 4 we nicknamed the SFR-M relation the
Galaxy Main Sequence GMS
Implications of the Galaxy Main Sequence A New Picture of
Star Formation in Field Galaxies since z  2
The surprising persistence of an equally sharp relation between SFR and M
out to z  2 or over 10 Gyr in lookback time has profound implications for
SF in eld galaxies over most of the cosmic time These were rst discussed
in Noeske et al 2007a and already in part in Zamojski et al 2007 and
pertain only to star-forming galaxies on the SFR-M relation and in the z-
dependent M range where we are complete not to those where SF was shut
down by still debated processes cf Faber et al 2007
1 Galaxies of equal mass must have had similar SF histories else the
scatter in SFR along the GMS would increase with time The smoothness of the
dependence of SFR on M suggests that we observe a generic mode of galaxy-
wide star formation possibly dominated by the same set of few physical processes
over several decades in galaxy mass
2 The 1 spread of SFR at a given M and z is  03 in logSFR
and remains roughly equally narrow out to z  2 This nding limits the
amplitude and duty cycles of typical variations in SFR that galaxies can have
experienced over the past 10 Gyr statistically a galaxy spent 23 of its time
within a factor of 2 of its typical SFR at that z If some galaxies underwent
stronger variations causing much of the observed scatter then the remaining
majority of galaxies must have had even smoother SF histories These limits
on SFR variations constrain the eect of galaxy interactions on galaxy SFRs
they are consistent with theoretical predictions of the inuence of frequent minor
interactions Somerville et al 2001 and constrain the longer-term 108 109 yr
enhancement of SFR eg Cox et al 2006 by major mergers to a modest
factor
3 The factor by which the SFR along the GMS have decreased since  2
see Section 2 is much larger than the amplitude of typical SFR variations
The dominant process in the evolution of SF over the past 10 Gyr was hence
a gradual decline of SFR in individual galaxies with at most modest variations

that were superposed on that smooth decline It is especially noteworthy that
these SFR variations seem to have the same relative amplitude factor at all
z out to z  2 episodic SF variations or starbursts played a minor barely
evolving role in the SF history of the Universe and of typical galaxies This
result is contrary to the formerly popular hypothesis that the evolution of SF
might be driven by increasingly frequent strong starbursts at higher z
The eect of galaxy interactions on SFR has now been measured for galaxies
in major and minor mergers and close pairs Lin et al 2007 Robaina et al
2009 and this conference Jogee et al 2009 and this conference These
studies have consistently shown a mild enhancement of SFR SFR distributions
of interacting samples are shifted to  2 larger values than those of isolated
control samples This limits the fraction of M formed at intermediate z to
 10 Robaina et al 2009 and this conference
Finally Figure 1 green line reveals the origin of the strong number den-
sity increase of Luminous Infrared Galaxies LIRGs with z apparently galaxies
become IR-luminous due to their generic gradual evolution of star formation
where SFR and hence likely their dust extinction increase with z This sup-
ports studies Bell et al 2005 Melbourne et al 2005 that found LIRGs at in-
termediate z to have mostly regular disk-like morphologies and suggested that
LIRGs are a universal phase in the intrinsic gradual evolution of many galaxies
4 The Galaxy Main Sequence The Stellar Main Sequence - Equiv-
alent for Galaxies
The results I summarized in Section 2 reveal a fundamental role of the SFR-M
relation because galaxies of equal mass have similar SF histories they must
evolve along similar tracks in the SFR - M plane The SFR - M relation at
a given z must therefore mark the point on each mass-dependent evolutionary
track across the galaxy mass spectrum at that z it is an isochrone cutting across
Star Formation to z  1
the evolutionary tracks at a given time See Figure 2 where this is shown for
the equivalent case of specic SFR vs M at dierent z
This is analog to another important isochrone in astrophysics - the Hertz-
sprung-Russell Diagram which is a superposition of the mass-dependent stellar
evolutionary tracks In this picture the galaxies SFR-M relation is the analog
of the stellar main sequence where regular active evolution driven by the same
set of physical processes in an undisturbed system proceeds until a change in
physics moves the object to its red late stages and passive end stadium the red
and dead galaxies Incidentally the galaxies Main Sequence Turno oc-
curs systematically earlier for more massive galaxies eg Bundy et al 2006
similar to stars
These similarities led us to adopt the term Galaxy Main Sequence and
the GMS is as fundamental to the understanding of galaxy evolution as the
stellar MS to stellar physics from the GMS at dierent z we can recover the
mass-dependent SF histories of galaxies In Noeske et al 2007b we presented
a rst simple parametric approach The evolution of the GMS was modeled by
simple smooth model SF histories justied by the dominance of the smoothly
declining component of SF histories Section 2 We chose exponential SF his-
tories  models given their previous success for many applications both
parameters the e-folding time  and the formation redshift zf where SF be-
gins were allowed to depend on the galaxies baryonic mass as power laws 1
This model reproduces the evolution of SFR and M on the GMS up to z  11
remarkably well and can attribute the scatter of SFR along the GMS to scatter
in SF history parameters at a given mass see Noeske et al 2007b Figure 1
suggesting an even smaller role of episodic or bursty SF These  models are the
rst parametrization of the mass-dependent SF histories of galaxies
Figure 2 shows the  models colored lines in the specic SFR SFR nor-
malized by M vs M plane It is equivalent to the SFR-M plane essentially
with the MS rotated clockwise For illustration the model GMS is extrapolated
out to z  4 note that the models are only constrained by data to z  1 The
evolutionary tracks black arrows reveal substantial mass growth due to SF
with redshift for all but the most massive galaxies also found by independent
methods Conroy et al 2007 Zheng et al 2007 Comparing galaxies of equal
M at dierent z is therefore generally not justied one may compare very dif-
ferent objects Instead one needs to compare galaxies on the same evolutionary
track ie apply a mass correction that can for the rst time be inferred from
the  models discussed above or future rened parametrizations
1Note that the mass in Noeske et al 2007b is the baryonic mass of a closed box model Since
galaxies are not closed boxes this mass will depend in a complicated way on the galaxies actual
baryonicdarktotaldynamical masses This mass merely acts as a dummy parameter to
generate evolutionary tracks that correctly reproduce the data on SFR and M vs z by keeping
track of the stellar mass growth due to a SF history These tracks can however easily be linked
to actual stellar masses at any observable z through the M they generate at a given z

In less mas-
sive galaxies SF declines
not only more slowly many
low mass galaxies are also
inecient at forming stars
at high z and attain sus-
tained ecient SF only at
lower z
5 A Delayed Onset of Ecient Star Formation in Less Massive
Galaxies
Interestingly the  model ts required both  and zf to be mass-dependent
Less massive galaxies had not only longer   ie a slower decline of SF SF
being less ecient and having lower initial SFRs they also had systematically
later zf  equivalent to a later onset of SF The observed Downsizing in SF
galaxies is apparently a combination of both phenomena
The late zf are required to account for the high specic SFR SFRM of
a majority of sub-L galaxies at z  0 see Figure 2 in Noeske et al 2007b
These imply doubling times much shorter than the age of the Universe ie
these galaxies cannot have formed stars at their observed rate without overpro-
ducing their stellar mass The usual explanation for high specic SFR starburst
events on top a lower SFR history is not physical because a majority of all such
galaxies would need to simultaneously undergo a stochastic event and is also in
contradiction with other observations - see Noeske et al 2007a for details In
a substantial fraction - but not necessarily all - of less massive galaxies SF must
hence have been inecient at early times and only attained sustained eciency
later than in more massive galaxies cf Figure 3
This mass-dependence of the onset of ecient SF dubbed Staged Galaxy
Formation Noeske et al 2007b is consistent with the observed presence of
very old stars  roughly a Hubble time  in the majority of Local Group
dwarf galaxies and other resolved systems Our data on SF to z  1 only
indicate that SF was inecient not absent in less massive galaxies allowing for
some old stars ii ecient SF only needs to delayed in the majority but not all
of such galaxies iii our data do not probe galaxies down to true dwarf masses
This systematic delay of ecient of SF in less massive galaxies is not likely
to be an artifact of SFR measurement errors It is consistent with statistical
studies of galaxy SF histories from independent methods - the evolution of stellar
mass functions and the fossil record in stellar populations of low z galaxies

6 Constraints to Galaxy Formation Models and Uncertainties of
SFR Measurements
The various data on SFR and M out to z  2 have become an important testbed
for theoretical work on galaxy formation and help to improve the treatment of
the complicated and numerically expensive baryon physics Current models of
galaxy populations do generally reproduce the SFR-M relation with a slope and
scatter similar to the observed one Elbaz et al 2007 Daddi et al 2007 Dave
Two types of discrepancies seem however to be universal between the data
and models On the one hand models underpredict the redshift evolution of
SFR for galaxies on the GMS It is currently debated whether this results from
systematic errors in SFR measurements at high z problems of model physics
or both Elbaz et al 2007 Daddi et al 2007 Dave 2008 On the other hand
the delay of ecient SF in less massive galaxies is not correctly reproduced
by current models Cirasuolo et al 2008 Marchesini et al 2008 Fontanot et al
2009 Found from independent data and methods Section 5 this dierence
is probably physical and likely due to not yet fully understood baryonic physics
Neistein et al 2006 that renders SF or its fueling processes inecient at early
times in low mass halos
While observed galaxy SFR across most of the cosmic time have provided
new key information for many purposes considerable work is still necessary and
underway to improve their calibrations and systematics see eg Salim et al
2009 improve restframe IR coverage with Herschel ALMA and JWST In
addition systematics like the adopted stellar IMF and extinction curves can be
tested from non-standard derivations of SFR Conroy et al 2007 Chen et al
