Abstract
We exactly calculate the thermal distribution and temperature of Hawking ra-
diation for a two-dimensional charged dilatonic black hole after it has settled down
to an equilibrium state The calculation is carried out using the Bogoliubov co-
ecients The background of the process is furnished by a preexisting black hole
and not by collapsing matter as considered by Giddings and Nelson for the case of
a Schwarzschild black hole Furthermore the vanishing of the temperature andor
the Hawking radiation in the extremal case is obtained as a regular limit of the
general case

Introduction
By 1973 it was well known that black holes had two main properties i the total surface
of the event horizon cannot decrease and ii the surface gravity is constant on the event
horizon These properties were elements of the classical theory of black holes 1 In 1974
SW Hawking observed that black holes radiate as a consequence of quantum eects and
that the spectrum of this radiation is thermal 2 Therefore black holes can evaporate
and in order to understand this process we are necessarily led to a marriage between
quantum mechanics and gravity even in the presence of a weak gravitational eld The
divergent basic assumptions underlying these two theories gave birth to a number of
serious problems which hadnt been faced till then A characteristic paradox which has
not yet been resolved is the loss of information For all such issues two-dimensional
black holes can be a theoretical lab since they describe the spherically symmetric sector of
the corresponding four-dimensional geometries Moreover in 1992 two-dimensional black
hole solutions were seen as background solutions of eective actions emerging from string
theory 3 4 leading to a more careful study of this eld 5 6
In this work motivated by the calculation of the Bogoliubov coecients in the background
of a two-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole formated by the collapse of conformal
matter 6 we calculate the corresponding eect in the background of a primordial charged
blak hole The paper is organized as follows In section 1 we repeat the calculation of
Giddings and Nelson in the case of a primordial black hole That is we do not invoke the
region of the linear dilaton vacuum and we choose conveniently the ingoing states The
coincidence with the results of 6 proves the correctness of our choice In section 2 we
extend the analysis of section 1 to the case of a two-dimensional charged black hole In
particular we calculate the Bogoliubov coecients the resulting thermal distribution and
the corresponding temperature Our results are of course in accordance with what is
known about charged black holes One of the interesting outcomes of our calculation is
that it yields regular continuous limit both for the case of an uncharged and an extremal
black hole Finally we conclude with a discussion of our results
1 Schwarzschild Black Hole
The Bogoliubov coecients for the case of a Schwarzschild two-dimensional black hole
have been explicitly determined in 6 The background of this process is taken to be
collapsing matter The formated black hole is characterized by a thermal distribution
of Hawking radiation at temperature T  
2  In this section we are going to compute
the Hawking radiation emitted by a Schwarzschild black hole without invoking the
formation process Before proceeding with the calculation of the Bogoliubov coecients
we will give the line element of the black hole in various coordinate systemsThis is
important since various parts of the calculations that follow are simplied by the use of
dierent coordinate systems
i Schwarzschild gauge
The two-dimensional dilatonic black hole in the Schwarzschild gauge is characterized
by the line element
where the function gr is given by
ds2  grdt2  g1rdr2

and 0  t   rH  r   with rH  1
the black hole
ii Unitary gauge
The line element is
2 ln M
  the position of the event horizon of
where the unitary variable y is given by the following expression

lnerrH  pe2rrH   1
and 0  y  
iii Conformal gauge
The line element in this gauge is
ds2  1  e2x1dt2  dx2
where the variable x is given by
lne2rrH   1
and   x  
iv Asymmetric gauge
The corresponding line element is
ds2  
42XX  1
where the asymmetric variable is given by
X  e2rrH   1
and 0  X  
Considering now a massless scalar eld  satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation 2  0
we have for example in the unitary gauge

The solution for the modes of the scalar eld following EC Titchmarsh 7 is given by

The above spectrum leads to a thermal distribution at temperature 8 
Note that the above result can be reached in any coordinate system just by taking
care of the appropriate Jacobian The coincidence with the results of 6 points to the
fact that the careful use of the plane waves as incoming states is correct even if we have
not the linear dilaton vacuum region which exists in 6 We can thus proceed with the
consideration of the charged black hole
2 Charged Black Hole
The line element of the charged two-dimensional black hole is given by in coordinates
corresponding to the Schwarzschild gauge of the previous section 10

with 0  t   r  r   r being the future event horizon of the black hole
Following a parametrization analogous to the four-dimensional case the metric function
factorizes as
gr  1  e2r1  e2r
2pM 2  Q2
we can recognize immediately the outer event horizon H  placed at the point r  1
while the inner horizon H  is at the point r  1
the two surfaces coincide in a single event horizon at the point

The line element 20-23 takes the following forms in the dierent coordinate systems
previously considered
i Unitary gauge
The line element reads
ds2  
2sinh2ycosh2y

dt2  dy2
where the unitary variable is given by
lncid20r 1

and 0  y   while   1  
ii Asymmetric gauge
In this coordinate system the line element reads

where X  e2rr  1  e2r
iii Conformal Gauge

The line element of the two-dimensional spacetime is
XxXx  
Xx  12
dt2  dx2
where the conformal variable x is given by
 X  1 1
and   x  
Considering again a massless scalar eld  satisfying the Klein-Gordon equation 2  0
in the conformal gauge which in this case is more convenient for simplicity reasons we
get the solution for the modes of the scalar eld 
t x  Neiteix
where the normalization factor reads 
N 
Now we can follow the analysis of previous section Our incoming states are again
plane waves with the space variable identied to the variable of the corresponding
p22
Schwarzchild gauge In this case it turns out that the asymmetric gauge is more con-
venient for evaluating the integrals in 12 13 one needs only to use the appropriate
Jacobian Skipping the details of the calculation the Bogoliubov coecients for the case
of two-dimensional charged black hole are found to be

which are useful for the evaluation of the Hawking radiation for a two-dimensional charged
black hole
It is noteworthy to observe that if we set   1 in other words   0 ie the black
hole has no charge Q  0 then the expressions 32 and 33 coincide with expressions
15 and 16 respectively It is also very interesting to observe the consequences of the
presence of the electric charge to the equilibrium state in which the black hole has settled
down and more specically the relation between the electric charge and the temperature
If we wish to count the particles which are detected in the case of Schwarschild black
hole and charged black hole we have to evaluate the following quantity

For our convenience and without loss of generality we set   1

Plotting the quantity 36 as a function of frequency  of the outgoing modes for dierent
values of the parameter  which denotes the presence of the electric charge and the ratio
between mass M and charge Q we get gure 1
Figure 1 Diagrams obtained from the integration of the quantity 36 over the variable
 for   1   09   07 and   05 respectively
It is obvious from the above graph that as  decreases ie the ratio Q
M increases the graph
falls down This means that the corresponding black holes have lower temperature This
result can also be reached considering the denition 8

which leads to the following expression for the Hawking temperature 
Equation 39 is the Reissner-Nordstrom analog of equation 19 holding for the Schwa-
rzschild case When the parameter  approaches 1 ie the electric charge is zero Q  0
we get that 39 goes over to 19When the parameter  approaches zero ie the electric
charge is equal to mass Q  M extremal case then the temperature is zero T  0
ie the black hole freezes completely This known result 1113 appears here as the
regular   0 or   1 limit of the more general case This can be seen either from
gure 1 or analytically working the limiting cases of 34 35 The zero charge case has
already been discussed Furthermore the coecients in the abovementioned expressions
go to those of the at space as   0 indicating the freezing of the extremal black hole
Namely 2   and 2  0 for positive to positive frequency transitions
3 Discussion
In this work we have explicitly calculated the Bogoliubov coecients for a background
which is an already formated primordial two-dimensional black hole with  a mass
M Schwarzschild case b mass M and electric charge Q Reissner-Nordstrom
case We have evaluated graphically their corresponding thermal spectrums and we have
found an explicit expression for their temperatures when the system has settled down
to an equilibrium state We have concluded that the temperature of the Hawking
radiation for the two-dimensional charged black hole is a function of charge and mass as
it is in the case of four-dimensional black hole in contradistinction to the two-dimensional
Schwarzschild case where temperature does not depend on mass We have shown that as
the mass of the two-dimensional charged black hole decreases the temperature of Hawking
radiation also decreases till the moment when the mass becomes equal to the charge
extremal case at which moment the two-dimensional black hole freezes completely
This denotes that the extremal black holes can be quantum mechanically a stable ending
point for the black holes during the process of their evaporation
It is worthexploring how the analytical results discussed in this work can be applied for
the study of thermodynamic properties of the two-dimensional black holes
It is also
interesting to see how the calculations performed for the two-dimensional case can be
extended for the higher dimensional geometries andor include the other charge a black
hole can carry angular momentum We hope to return to this issues in a future work
