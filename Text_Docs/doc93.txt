Abstract  
Virus entry is a multistep process that triggers a variety of cellular pathways 
interconnecting   into   a   complex   network   yet   the   molecular   complexity   of   this 
network remains largely unsolved Here by employing systems biology approach 
to   combine   protein-interactions   from   existing   database   and   genome-wide 
transcriptome data we reveal a systemic virus-entry network initiated by human 
cytomegalovirus   HCMV   a   widespread   opportunistic   pathogen   This   network 
contains all known interactions and functional modules ie groups of proteins 
coordinately   responding  to  HCMV   entry   The   number   of   both   genes   and 
functional modules activated in this network dramatically declines shortly within 
25   min   post-infection   While   modules   annotated   as   receptor   system   ion 
transport   and   immune   response   are   continuously   activated   during   the   entire 
process   of   HCMV   entry   those   for   cell   adhesion   and   skeletal   movement  are 
specifically   activated   during   viral   early   attachment  and   those   for   immune 
response during virus entry HCMV entry requires a complex receptor network 
involving   different   cellular   components   comprising   not   only   cell   surface 
receptors   but   also   pathway   components   in   signal   transduction   skeletal 
development   immune   response   endocytosis   ion   transport   macromolecule 
metabolism   and   chromatin   remodeling   Interestingly   genes   that   function   in 
chromatin remodeling are the most abundant in this receptor system suggesting 
that global modulation of transcriptions is one of the most important events in 
HCMV entry Results of in silico knock out further reveal that this entire receptor 
network is primarily controlled by multiple elements such as EGFR Epidermal 
Growth Factor and SLC10A1 sodiumbile acid cotransporter family member 1 
Thus   our   results   demonstrate   that   a   complex   systemic   network   in   which 
components coordinating efficiently in time and space contributes to virus entry 
The findings and original network constructed here lay a foundation to further 
dissect the molecular complexity of virus entry and provide potential drug targets 
Introduction
Virus   entry   activates   various   cellular   pathway   components   For   decades 
intensive studies on individual genes and pathways involved in virus entry have 
successfully provided us with  an unprecedented wealth of molecular detail on 
how component proteins respond to virus entry 1 Quite unexpectedly however 
drugs   targeting   individual   components   of   specialized   pathways   identified   in 
single-component studies not only failed to control HCMV infection but also 
caused huge unexpected side-effects2 Clearly virus entry is not simply the 
result of a single activated gene or pathway Many proteins and pathways are 
continuously cross-talking to coordinate cellular signals during each step of virus 
entry such as virus attachment interaction with receptors signaling membrane 
fusion   and   endocytosis   Nevertheless   how   these   proteins   interact   with   each 
other to permit virus entry into cells is not completely understood In particular 
very   little   is   known   about   the   system-wide   network   and   functional   modules 
involved in virus entry what the complete virus-receptor network looks like and 
which proteins control this network This type of knowledge is the initial step 
towards   completely   elucidating   the   complexity   of   virus   entry   and   developing 
efficient treatments to prevent virus spread to other cells  
HCMV is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen that causes fatal or permanently 
debilitating disease in immunologically compromised individuals and neonates 
Particularly at risk for infection with this virus are AIDS patients cancer patients 
organ   or   tissue   transplant   recipients   undergoing   immunosuppressive   therapy 
infants   fetuses   and   the   elderly     More   recently   the   virus   has   also   been 
implicated   in   tumorigenesis3   and   the   etiology   of   circulatory   diseases   most 
notably atherosclerosis  
HCMV entry into cells activates up- and down-regulates a variety of signaling 
pathways and multiple cellular receptors HCMV attachmententry  5 to 25 
min   post-infection   PI   triggers   components   and   pathways   linked   to   receptor 
tyrosine   kinase   mitogen-activated   protein   kinase   signaling   cytoskeletal 
rearrangement   transcription   factors   prostaglandins   and   cytokines   4     In 
particular HCMV entry activates epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR a vb 3 
integrin a 21 a 61 and a v3 and their signaling pathways 5-8 which play 
important roles in HCMV entry Therefore EGFR and a vb 3 integrin have been 
proposed as HCMV receptor and co-receptor respectively 5-8 However EGFR 
is not expressed on all HCMV-permissive cell types that are efficiently infected by 
HCMV   In   addition   EGFR   might   not   be   essential   for   HCMV   entry6   and 
integrins only play a role in downstream events during HCMV entry5-8 In vivo 
HCMV can infect almost every organ system and tissue type469 and in vitro 
HCMV can promiscuously   penetrate diverse cell lines with varying receptors 
Together these findings  suggest that HCMV entry activates multiple receptors 
that interact in a network and that elucidating the HCMV entry process could 
provide valuable insights into the mechanism of virus entry in general
It   can   be   extremely   challenging   for   traditional   genetics   and   biochemistry   to 
characterize a complex process like virus entry but systems biology network 
approaches   eg   system-wide   protein-protein   interaction   network   can   greatly 
facilitate such a task10 Protein interactions can be physical binding interactions 
eg   those   from   yeast
 two-hybrid   and   functional   interactions   eg   via 
interactions with phosphate groups on phosphoproteins These interactions can 
be extracted from published databases and can be consolidated into genome-
wide comprehensive networks11 Systematic analysis of these networks can 
simultaneously elucidate all possible pathway components associated with viral 
infection and the cross-talk that occur among these components in response to 
virus infection  
In   this   study   we   used   a   systems   biology   approach   for   the   first   time   to 
systematically elucidate a comprehensive systemic network response to virus 
attachmententry reveal a comprehensive virus receptor network and identify in 
silico   the   essential   components   of   these   networks   Our   work   provides  a 
conceptual framework to further understand the fundamental molecular basis of 
virus entry 
Results
A comprehensive protein-interaction network linked to HCMV entry
To systematically decode the systemic network activated by HCMV entry we first 
utilized   systems   network   approaches   to   search   published   databases   for   all 
physical   and   functional   protein-protein   interactions   known   to   date   to   be 
associated   with   HCMV   attachment   and   entry   see   Materials   and   Methods 
These   interactions   were   then   combined   into   a   systemic   protein-interaction 
network database which currently comprises 6651 nodes proteins and 64392 
edges   interactions   Figure   1A   Table   S1   and   is   being   expanded   daily   as 
databases are updated  
To examine the overall architectural features of this network we analyzed overall 
node degree distribution which represents the possibility of nodes having a given 
degree and the number of incident edges to a given node The node degree 
distribution of our network decreases with degree and approximates a power law 
figure 1B indicating that our network is a scale-free network which is proposed 
as a universal network framework in biology networks12-14   In addition we 
also calculated the average of the clustering coefficient Ck distribution which 
describes   how   nodes   link   to   others   via   their   K   neighbor   to   form   clusters   or 
groups Ck also diminishes with the increase in number of neighbors figure 1B
 indicating that our network is a   hierarchical network 12-14 predominated by 
hubs highly connected proteins  and bottlenecks which are  nodes with many 
shortest   paths   going   through   them   analogous   to   key   bridges   that   link   sub-
networks to a whole map network 15 Both hubs and bottlenecks likely play 
essential roles in this type of networks 12-15 These distribution properties of 
our network are similar to other biological networks previously reported12-14 
HCMV entry activates a complex systemic network
After constructing the comprehensive network database we next enriched the 
network figure 1 with genome-wide transcriptome data on genes significantly 
altered by  HCMV attachment and entry 5  min  and 25 min respectively  post 
infection of human primary foreskin fibroblasts a common cell line used as a 
model of HCMV infection A total of 408 and 240 genes showed significantly 
altered gene expression patterns at 5 min and 25 min PI respectively Table S2-
S3 These enriched networks became systemic networks activated by HCMV 
attachment and entry figure 2 A total of 7 functional modules figure 2 were 
activated at 5 min PI including phosphorylation intercellular junction assembly 
iron transport cell differentiation vesicle-mediated transport immune response 
chromatin   disassembly   macromolecule   metabolism   cell   communication   and 
signal transduction At 25 min PI 3 functional modules were activated including 
immune   response   transmembrane   receptor   protein   tyrosine   kinase   signaling 
pathway   and   sodium   ion   transport   This   rapid   decrease   in   the   number   of 
activated genes from 408 5 min PI to 240 25 min PI Table S2-S3 within a 
very short time interval after HCMV infection and the decline in network modules 
from 7 to 3 fit the biphasic model of cellular response to infection 4 in which 
activation of cellular signaling peaks immediately in response to infection then 
rapidly   declines   dramatically   and   then   gradually   increases   again   to   another 
While   modules   of   receptor   system   ion   transport   and   immune   response 
dominated   the   entire   process   of   HCMV   entry   cell   adhesion   and   skeletal 
movement were featured at 5 min PI and immune response predominated in the 
network at 25 min PI figure 2 Notably genes were not co-regulated in most of 
the modules activated during HCMV entry figure 2 indicating that HCMV entry 
not only modulates different complex modules but also mediates components 
within the same module HCMV entry thereby elaborates module functions of the 
same module
A systemic receptor network involved in HCMV entry 
Genes that are down-regulated could play an important role in HCMV attachment 
and entry but the receptor system in particular should be up-regulated during 
these  stages  of   infection 5-7   Since  the  network  comprising  down-regulated 
genes did not have any characterized functions figure S1 we focused on a 
systemic   receptor   network   containing   123   proteins   Table   S4   that   were 
enhanced   at   both   time   points   5   min   and   25   min   PI   This   network   was 
decomposed into 7 functional groups including macromolecule metabolism and 
chromatin   remodeling   signal   transduction   cell   surface   receptor   pathway 
skeletal development immune response endocytosis and ion transport figure 3
   Consistent   with   previous   reports   about   HCMV   entry459   the   network 
includes   almost   all   known   pathways   and   their   components   up-regulated   by 
HCMV entry Such pathways include receptor- like EGFR  in the receptor group 
mitogen-activated protein kinase-like MAPK10 mitogen-activated protein kinase 
10 in the signaling group components for cytoskeletal rearrangement in the 
skeletal group transcription factors located in the nucleus cytokines located in 
the extracellular space and components for calcium transport in the ion transport 
group   Importantly   our   network  also   revealed  a  systemic  view   of   the  HCMV 
receptor system in which genes are clustered into multiple functional groups of 
varied   pathways   and   simultaneously   performing   various   functions   and 
bioprocesses during HCMV infection For example the receptor pathway group 
contains   18   different   receptor   components   EGFR   TP73L   CCR5   OR1A1

SLC34A2 ATP7A TRPM1 MBP SLC10A1 VMD2 TRPC5 SLC17A2 While 
signal   transduction   for   cell   communication   and   cell   adhesion   dominated   the 
network components for macromolecule metabolism and chromatin assembly or 
disassembly were surprisingly the most abundant in the network This indicated 
that   chromatin  remodeling  is  one  of   the   major  bioprocesses  occurring  in  the 
human host during HCMV attachment   These data reveal a complex HCMV 
receptor   system   that   comprises   several   functional   sub-networks   that   are 
functionally   dominated   by   signal   transduction   cell   adhesion   and   chromatin 
remodeling
Key proteins in the HCMV receptor network
To   identify   the   essential   components   in   the   HCMV   receptor   network   we 
examined the contribution of individual components to the network by knocking 
out   single   genes   in   silico   Special   attention   was   paid   to   protein   components 
located in the extracellular space and cell membrane figure 3 because these 
components play crucial roles in initiating bioprocesses during HCMV entry or 
serve   as   potential   HCMV   receptors   After   knocking   out   individual   genes   we 
calculated the alterations in the average number of neighbors which describes 
the   contribution   of   individual   nodes   to   network   connectivity   and   the   mean 
shortest path which measures the smallest number of links between selected 
nodes and essentially indicates network diameter Node knockouts in a network 
would   decrease   network   connectivity   Moreover   knockout   of   nodes   that   are 
higher in the network hierarchy would result in greater reduction of connectivity 
As for diameter the longer the diameter the less interconnectivity there is in the 
network Knocking out a hub would increase diameter because of the loss of 
short paths in a network whereas knocking out a bottleneck would decrease 
diameter because the network would be broken down and the long path that 
normally link to sub-networks would be lost
Results of in silico knock out experiments showed that the component EGFR 
contributed most in network connectivity and diameter figure 4 A-B indicating 
that   it   serves   as   a   hub   highly   connected   proteins   in   the   HCMV   receptor 
network   Similarly   IL4   interleukin   4   KRAS   kirsten   rat   sarcoma   2   viral 
oncogene homolog and IBSP integrin-binding sialoprotein also serve as hubs 
in this network activated by HCMV entry In contrast whereas CLU clusterin 
and SLC10A1 are also major contributors to network connectivity knocking them 
out       resulted   in   a   decrease   in   network   diameter   figure   4   B   figure   4A 
indicating   that   these   two   components   serve   as   bottlenecks   in   this   network 
stimulated by HCMV attachment and entry 
To confirm in silico the consequence of knocking out these hubs and bottlenecks 
the structure of mutant and wild-type network activated by HCMV attachment and 
entry   was   compared   figure   5   While   knocking   out   hubs   like   EGFR   altered 
linkages of local sub-network figure 5A and 5B knocking out bottlenecks CLU 
and   SLC10A1   completely   broke   down   the   entire   network   into   at   least   two 
independent sub-networks as highlighted in figure 5C These results indicate that 
both potential hubs EGFR IL4 KRAS and IBSP and bottlenecks CLU and 
SLC10A1 identified above are real hubs and bottlenecks in this network and 
that they play important roles in this network This finding is similar to reports 
about other networks in which hubs and bottlenecks are likely more essential in a 
network than other nodes 12-15  
Discussion 
HCMV entry activates a complex systemic network
Studies on virus entry using traditional genetics and biochemistry approaches 
have identified several viral entry pathways into host cells  15-7 However the 
molecular   mechanisms   underlying   virus   entry   remain   largely   elusive   We 
systematically assembled the existing databases of all pathway components into 
a systemic scale-free network to elucidate the complexity of HCMV entry figure 
1   The   advantage   of   systems   network   approach   is   that   it   accounts   for   all 
interactions and cross-talks among components and treats the whole interactions 
as a network instead of linear circuits explicated by conventional approaches 
The   cross-talk   that   has   been   mostly   ignored   in   conventional   studies   can 
significantly   contribute   to   real   phenotypes16   and   they   were   included   in   the 
present systemic network The network constructed in the present study is based 
on  current database  Future database updates  and system-wide protein data 
may slightly change the linkages in our network moreover our network data 
need   to   be   verified   by   direct   experimental   evidences   like   those   in   systems 
biology approaches However the overall architecture of our network database is 
not expected to change significantly because of its stable universal features and 
scale-free   and  hierarchical  structure   Figure   1   Therefore   the   network 
constructed in this study can be adapted to analyze molecular mechanisms of 
host-microbe interactions in general and can potentially find application in drug 
discovery against virus entry
Entry of infectious agents into host cells activates complex bioprocesses 117-19
 Previous studies demonstrated that HCMV entry stimulates gene expression of 
various   pathway   components   such   as   those   involved   in   immune   response 
calcium transport and signal transduction 4-792021 In the present study we 
systematically   identified   a   systemic   network   and   dynamic   molecular   modules 
activated   by   HCMV   entry   which   includes   not   only   genes   and   pathways 
previously reported but also those uncovered in the present study figure 2 
Network module identification could be affected by network sources and some 
identified   modules   might   not   be   related   to   biological   functions22   However 
since our network interactions were weighed on the basis of source confidences 
and   then   network   topology   features   and   gene   functions   from   gene   ontology 
databases were combined to identify the network modules our set of modules in 
this study likely represents a featured class of protein complexes in a natural 
biological network stimulated by HCMV entry These functional modules can be 
used   to   further   model   the   quantitative   contribution   of   signal   transduction   of 
pathway components to HCMV entry by systems biology approaches 
  The   dynamic   functional   modules   identified   here   were   activated   immediately 
upon infection Modules of cell adhesion and skeletal movement were activated 
at 5 min PI figure 2 suggesting that HCMV enters the cell much earlier than 
thought Notably genes in most of the modules were not co-regulated figure 2 
suggesting   a   greater   molecular   complexity   of   HCMV   entry   than   previously 
thought 
A complex receptor network involved
in HCMV entry
Infectious agents can easily bind to cell surfaces via chemical interactions but 
with low affinity Microbe-specific receptors and co-receptors are required to 
strengthen these bindings but they are not likely sufficient for a successful 
entry which require subtle contributions from other functional groups For 
instance   calcium   transport   and  cytoskeletal   movement   which   are   often 
observed during microbe entry are essential for surviving some receptor-
ligand   interactions   and   play   crucial   roles   in   strengthening   microbe-
attachment to cell surface 23 Similar roles are true for signal transduction 
immune response and chromatin remodeling 23 Therefore a complex 
coordinated network is required for microbe entry into cells but has not 
been elucidated until now 1181924 Here our data revealed a HCMV 
receptor   network   that   includes   not   only   receptor   sub-network   but   also 
chromatin remodeling signal transduction skeletal development immune 
response   endocytosis   and   ion   transport   figure   3   Since   this   network 
contains all pathway components known to date to be related to virus entry 
this network probably represents a complete coordinated network sufficient 
to   mediate   HCMV   entry   Surprisingly   genes   associated   with   chromatin 
remodeling   were   the   most   abundant   in   this   HCMV   receptor   network 
suggesting that chromatin remodeling is a major event during HCMV entry 
Bioprocesses   associated   with   microbe   entry   are   similar   for   different   microbe 
species but the pathway components mediating these bioprocesses are usually 
species-specific Particularly cellular receptors are highly species-dependent As 
for HCMV integrin cellular co-receptors facilitate HCMV entry but they only work 
in downstream receptor-ligand interactions during HCMV entry 589 Indeed a 
successful integrin-ligand high affinity attachment depends on how molecules 
underneath   the   membrane   surface   respond   to   integrin-ligand   adhesion  23 
Other proteins such as  focal adhesion kinase phosphatidylinositol phosphate 
kinase   and   F-actin   need   to   be   activated   before   integrin   receptor   activation 
2325 Over-expression of genes in the receptor and signal transduction groups 
figure   3   might   account   for   the   integrin   activation   For   example  PIP5K3 
phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphatephosphatidylinositol 5-kinase type I regulates 
actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion Dok2 docking protein 2 plays a crucial 
role in integrin outside-in signaling through a physical and functional interaction 
with integrin  a vb 3 MAPK10 mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 MAP kinase 
activity plays a key role in focal adhesion RAP2A RAS related protein 2a 
engages   beta2   integrins   IBSP   integrin-binding   sialoprotein   interacts   with 
integrins for cell adhesion These findings further argue for integrins acting as 
downstream co-receptors for HCMV entry meanwhile the identity of the HCMV 
receptor remains elusive 
Multiple receptors have been proposed for HCMV entry but they have not been 
unambiguously identified 4-79 Some of the 18 members of the receptor group 
in figure  3  likely  act  as HCMV  receptors     In particular  the  genes that are 
essential   in   the   HCMV   receptor   network   might   be   much   more   important   for 
HCMV entry than receptors defined previously because of their essentiality in this 
network Generally hubs and bottlenecks are likely essential in a network 12-15
 By knocking out genes in silico we identified EGFR IL4 KRAS and IBSP as 
hubs and CLU and SLC10A1 as bottlenecks in the HCMV receptor network 
figure 4-5 Hubs and bottlenecks are new emerging concepts and there is no 
available standard algorithm to identify them so far Identifications of hubs and 
bottleneck may be biased   depending on the algorithm and network resources 
used to construct the network  We merged all databases in our study figure 1 
to   eliminate   database   bias   and   the   node   contributions   for   both   network 
connectivity and diameter calculated here figure 4-5 were consistent with those 
for   network   centrality26   that   are   essential   for   a   network   data   not   shown 
Therefore the hubs and bottlenecks identified here are likely essential in the 
natural HCMV-receptor network and constitute the group  of  proteins that are 
likely essential for HCMV entry          
As a member of hubs EGFR was previously reported as an essential component 
of the HCMV receptor network although this result needs to be confirmed 67 
More detailed attention should be paid to the annotation of  egfr  genes used in 
studies because there are three annotated  egfr  genes in the human genome 
namely accession number  AF277897 located in chr755200539-55203821 
U95089   chr755054067-55192136   and   U48722   chr755054221-
55192136 Correspondingly there are three probe-sets in the Affymetrix chip 
1565484xat   210984xat   and   211607xat   In   our   gene   expression 
experiments   expression   of   the  egfr  gene   corresponding   to   accession 
AF277897   was   up-regulated   but   the   other   two  egfr  genes   were   down-
regulated  We focused on  the EGFR with  accession AF277897 because its 
expression was enhanced at both time points 5 min and 25 min PI Our network 
data also showed that the same EGFR plays an important if not essential role in 
HCMV attachment and entry at least at the early stage figure 4-5 A similar role 
was found for the other hubs KRAS is a protein in the small GTPase superfamily 
that is activated by integrins during virus entry KRAS also interacts with multiple 
immune receptors and is involved in multiple pathways related to cell adhesion 
and virus entry such as regulation of actin cytoskeleton tight junction EGFR-
ErbB   erythroblastoma   viral   gene   product   homolog   signaling   pathway   and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPK signaling httpwwwgenomejpkegg 
IL4 is a cytokine that facilitates virus entry27 IBSP is a sialoprotein that could 
bind to integrin as another component in the HCMV receptor system58 Two 
glycoproteins   SLC10A1   CLU   were   identified   as   bottlenecks   figure   4-5 
SLC10A1  solute  carrier  family  10   belongs   to  sodiumbile  acid  cotransporter 
family Ion transport plays an important role in integrin binding during virus entry 
as discussed above In addition SLC10A1 is also involved in lipid and lipoprotein 
metabolism
httpwwwreactomeorgcgi-bineventbrowser
DBgkcurrentID73923 which might be related to the lipid rafts that signal 
during virus entry CLU clusterin  is one of the sulphated glycoproteins  that is 
activated   by   virus   infection28   and   regulates   cell   communication   and   signal 
transduction   related   to   infection   like   the  lectin-induced   complement   pathway 
httpwwwinvitrogencomcontentcfmpageid10878   and   the   NF-kappaB 
pathway29 Thus these hubs and bottlenecks identified here are biologically 
important for HCMV entry
In this study we used gene expression data to enrich the protein-interaction 
network This activated network may not be completely consistent with those 
derived from protein level data but genomics data measured by the Affymetrix 
microarray employed here are generally overlapping with the proteomics data 30
 Our findings about the complex network activated by HCMV entry and the 
HCMV   receptor   network   should  emphasize  the   molecular   complexity  of   virus 
entry Targeting one or two receptor proteins as currently employed may not 
efficiently   block   virus   entry   and   prevent   virus   spread   across   cells   The   rapid 
change in dynamic modules makes it challenging to develop an efficient strategy 
to block virus entry but the receptor network identified here and the approach we 
have   developed   should   lay   a   framework   to   further   dissect   the   molecular 
complexity of virus entry and facilitate efficient drug development

Virus and Cells
HCMV   Towne   strain   American   Type   Culture   Collection   was   used   to   infect 
primary   human   foreskin   fibroblasts   CC-2509   at   a   MOI   of   10   as   previously 
described34 
RNA extraction and microarray hybridization
Infected and uninfected cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation 
RNA was purified using the RNeasy RNA purification kit QIAGEN Inc 
Valencia CA followed by DNase treatment to eliminate all traces of DNA 
according to the manufacturers recommendation GeneChip One-Cycle 
Target Labeling and Control Reagents Affymetrix Santa Clara CA were 
used to process RNA and for hybridization following the manufacturers 
protocols   Affymetrix   Human   Genome   U133   Plus   20   Arrays   which 
contains over 47000 transcripts that completely cover the whole human 
genome were employed in this study 
Microarray data analysis
Algorithms   3536   were   employed   to   analyze   microarray   data   which   were 
normalized using the invariant set method 3536 The array with median CEL 
intensity   was   chosen   as   the   baseline   array   The   model-base   PMMM 
expression value was calculated To minimize false positives two steps were 
performed to filter the data The first step compared samples arrays in a pair-
wise   fashion   with   the  threshold   for   fold   change  at    2  with  90  confidence 
interval and a difference in expression values between the genes 100 The 
second filter criteria was set as coefficient of variation  03 and the genes that 
were present were called at  20 Genes filtered from the screening criteria 
were taken to be the genes with significant alteration in gene expression and 
used to enrich the network 
Network analysis
Genes with significant alteration in gene expression at time points 0 min 5 min 
25 min PI were used to enrich the network initially constructed figure 1 and 
table S1 Upon HCMV entry the enriched network becomes an activated 
up- and down regulated network Figures 2 and table S2 The network was 
analyzed   by   using   Network   Analyzer
httpmedbioinfmpi-
infmpgdenetanalyzerindexphp   The   activated   network   was   weighted 
on   the   basis   of   confidences   of   interaction   sources   and   the   weighted 
networks were decomposed into functional modules based on topological 
interconnection intensity and gene functions httpwwwgeneontologyorg 
37-40   Genes   were   classified   according   to   gene   ontology   database

Figure 1 A comprehensive regulatory network linked to HCMV entry The 
network was constructed by using protein-protein binding database and protein 
functional database see text and Materials and Methods for details The insert 
shows a zoomed portion of entire network The colors of nodes proteins and 
edges   interactions   represent   gene   expression   levels   and   edge   sources 
respectively The same color strategy for nodes and edges will be used for all 
figures in this study unless otherwise specified Also shown are entire network 
properties including node degree distribution that approximates a power lawPk
  k        095 in our network and Ck distribution average clustering 
coefficient   that   measures   the   tendency   of   nodes   to   form   clusters12   which 
decreases with the number of neighbors
Figure 2 Systemic networks and functional modules activated by HCMV 
attachment and entry The complete network activated by HCMV entry is listed 
in tables S2 and S3   Only parts of entire networks are shown for clarity 2A 
functional modules activated at 5 min PI 2B activated network at 25 min PI 
Figure 3 Network up-regulated by HCMV entry Genes shown here were up-
regulated by HCMV entry at both 5 min and 25 min PI Genes are clustered into 
functional groups and color-coded Only the primary functions for each gene are 
indicated Cellular components are shown on the left side  
Figure   4   Contribution   of  individual  genes   to   properties   of  the   network 
enhanced  by  HCMV entry  Extracellular   and   membrane   components   of   the 
network enhanced by HCMV entry figure 3 were individually knocked out in 
silico and the effects of such knock out were calculated   Only genes with at 
least two direct neighbors in the network were knocked out because genes with 
only one direct neighbor or without neighbors are located at the end-terminal in 
the   network   and   would   not   significantly   affect   the   network   architecture   4A

HCMV entry 5A Entire wild-type network enhanced by HCMV entry with arrow 
pointing at genes to be knocked out Blue potential bottleneck nodes green 
potential   hubs   5B   Knocking   out   hubs   led   to   decrease   in   local   sub-network 
linkages as highlighted in green circle when compared to wild-type network 5C 
Knocking out bottleneck nodes broke down the entire network into at least two 
separated networks as highlighted in blue circles
