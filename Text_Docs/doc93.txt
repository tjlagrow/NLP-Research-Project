Abstract
Verbs are sometimes omitted in Japanese
sentences
It is necessary to recover
omitted verbs for purposes of language
understanding machine translation and
conversational processing This paper
describes a practical way to recover omit-
ted verbs by using surface expressions
and examples We experimented the res-
olution of verb ellipses by using this in-
formation and obtained a recall rate of
73 and a precision rate of 66 on test
sentences
This paper describes a practical method to re-
cover omitted verbs by using surface expressions
and examples In short 1 when the referent of
a verb ellipsis is in the context we use surface
expressions clue words 2 when the referent
is not in the context we use examples linguis-
tic data We dene the verb to which a verb
ellipsis refers as the recovered verb For exam-
ple KOWASHITA1 broke in the second sen-
tence of the following example is a verb ellipsis
KOWASHITA broke in the rst sentence is a
recovered verb

1 Introduction
Verbs are sometimes omitted in Japanese sen-
tences
It is necessary to resolve verb ellipses
for purposes of language understanding machine
translation and dialogue processing Therefore
we investigated verb ellipsis resolution in Japanese
sentences In connection with our approach we
would like to emphasize the following points
 Little work has been done so far on resolution
of verb ellipsis in Japanese
 Although much work on verb ellipsis in En-
glish has handled the reconstruction of the
ellipsis structure in the case when the omit-
ted verb is given little work has handled the
estimation of what is the omitted verb Dal-
rymple el al 91 Kehler 93 Lappin  Shih
96 On the contrary we handle the estima-
tion of what is the omitted verb
 In the case of Japanese the omitted verb
phrase is sometimes not in the context and
the system must construct the omitted verb
by using knowledge or common sense We
use example-based method to solve this prob-
KORE-MO ARE-MO
He broke this and that
KOWASHITA
broke
1 When a recovered verb exists in the context
we use surface expressions clue words This is
because an elliptical sentence in the case 1 is in
one of several typical patterns and has some clue
words For example when the end of an elliptical
sentence is the clue word MO also the sys-
tem judges that the sentence is a repetition of the
previous sentence and the recovered verb ellipsis
is the verb of the previous sentence
2 When a recovered verb is not in the context
we use examples The reason is that omitted verbs
in this case 2 are diverse and we use examples to
construct the omitted verbs The following is an
example of a recovered verb that does not appear
in the context
SOU UMAKU IKUTOWA OMOENAI 
I dont think
I dont think it succeeds so well 
succeed so well
1 A phrase in brackets  represents an omitted
The matching part The latter part
question sentence
KONNANI UMAKU IKUTOWA OMOENAI
like this
I dont think that it succeeded like this
it succeeds
I dont think
UMAKU IKUTOWA KAGIRANAI
every time it succeeds
You cannot expect to succeed every time
cannot expect to
KANZENNI UMAKU IKUTOWA IENAI
completely it succeeds
It cannot be said that it succeeds completely
it cannot be said
Figure 1 Sentences containing UMAKU IKU-
TOWA it succeeds in a corpus examples
When we want to resolve the verb ellipsis in this
sentence SOU UMAKU IKUTO WA OMOE-
NAI the system gathers sentences containing
the expression SOU UMAKU IKUTOWA it suc-
ceeds so well  from corpus as shown in Fig-
ure 1 and judges that the latter part of the highest
frequency in the obtained sentence in this case
OMOENAI I dont think etc is the desired
recovered verb
2 Categories of Verb Ellipsis
We handle only verb ellipses in the ends of sen-
tences
We classied verb ellipses from the view point
of machine processing The classication is shown
in Figure 2 First we classied verb ellipses by
checking whether there is a recovered verb in the
context or not Next we classied verb ellipses
by meaning In the context and Not in the
context in Figure 2 represent where the recov-
ered verb exists respectively Although the above
classication is not perfect and needs modica-
tion we think that it is useful to understand the
outline of verb ellipses in machine processing
The feature and the analysis of each category of
verb ellipsis are described in the following sections
21 When a Recovered Verb Ellipsis
Appears in the Context
211 QuestionAnswer
In questionanswer sentences verbs in answer
sentences are often omitted when answer sen-
tences use the same verb as question sentences
For example the verb of KORE WO this is
omitted and is KOWASHITA break in the
NANI-WO KOWASHITANO
What did you break
break
KORE-WO KOWASHITA
I broke this
break
The system judges whether the sentences are
questionanswer sentences or not by using surface
expressions such as NANI what and if so it
judges that the recovered verb is the verb of the
question sentence
212 Supplement
In sentences which play a supplementary role to
the previous sentence verbs are sometimes omit-
ted For example the second sentence is supple-
mentary explaining that the key I lost is house
key
KAGI-WO NAKUSHITA
I lost my key
IE-NO KAGI-WO
house
I lost my house key 
NAKUSHITA
To solve this we present the following method
using word meanings When the word at the end
of the elliptical sentence is semantically similar to
the word of the same case element in the previ-
ous sentence they correspond and the omitted
verb is judged to be the verb of the word of the
same case element in the previous sentence
this case since KAGI key and IE-NO KAGI
house key are semantically similar in the sense
that they are both keys the system judges they
correspond and the verb of IE-NO KAGI-WO
house key is NAKUSHITA lost
In addition to this method we use methods
using surface expressions For example when
a sentence has clue words such as the particle
MO which indicates repetition the sentence
is judged to be the supplement of the previous
sentence
There are many cases when an elliptical sen-
tence is the supplement of the previous sentence
In this work if there is no clue the system judges
that an elliptical sentence is the supplement of the
previous sentence
22 When a Recovered Verb does not
Appear in the Context
In the context
Not in the context
Question-Answer
Supplement
Interrogative sentence
The other ellipsis use of common sense

KAGI-WO NAKUSHITA IENOKAGI-WO
I lost my key I lost my house key
NAMAE-WA
What is your name
SOU UMAKUIKU-TOWA
I dont think it succeed so well
NANI-DESUKA
OMOENAI
Figure 2 Categories of verb ellipsis
Interrogative Sentence
Sometimes in interrogative sentences the par-
ticle WA is at the end of the sentence and the
verb is omitted For example the following sen-
tence is an interrogative sentence and the verb is
omitted
NAMAE-WA NANI-DESUKA
what
What is your name
If the end is of the form of Noun  WA
the sentence is probably an interrogative sentence
and thus the system judges it to be an interroga-
tive sentence 2
When we perform the same interpretation us-
ing a large amount of linguistic data we de-
tect the sentence containing an expression which
is semantically similar to JITSU-WA CHOTTO
ONEGAIGA To tell you the truth I have
a request and the latter part of JITSU-WA
CHOTTO ONEGAIGA is judged to be the con-
tent of the ellipsis To put it concretely the sys-
tem detects sentences containing the longest char-
acters at the end of the input sentence from corpus
and judges that the verb of the highest frequency
in the latter part of the detected sentences is a
recovered verb
3 Verb Ellipsis Resolution System
222 Other Ellipses Using Common Sense
31 Procedure
In the case of Not in the context the following
example exists besides Interrogative sentence
JITSU-WA CHOTTO ONEGAIGA ARIMASU
the truth a little
I have
To tell you the truth I have a request
request
This kind of ellipsis does not have the recovered
expression in sentences The form of the recov-
ered expression has various types This problem
is dicult to analyze
To solve this problem we estimate a recovered
content by using a large amount of linguistic data
When Japanese people read the above sentence
they naturally recognize the omitted verb is ARI-
MASU I have This is because they often use
the sentence JITSU-WA CHOTTO ONEGAIGA
ARIMASU To tell the truth I have a request
in daily life
2 Since this work is verb ellipsis resolution the system
must recover a verb such as NANI-DESUKA what is 
But the expression of the verb changes according to the
content of the interrogative sentence and we only deal with
judging whether the sentence is an interrogative sentence
or not
Before the verb ellipsis resolution process sen-
tences are transformed into a case structure by
the case structure analyzerKurohashi  Nagao
94 Verb ellipses are resolved by heuristic rules
for each sentence from left to right Using these
rules our system gives possible recovered verbs
some points and it judges that the possible re-
covered verb having the maximum point total is
the desired recovered verb This is because a num-
ber of types of information is combined in ellipsis
resolution An increase of the points of a possible
recovered verb corresponds to an increase of the
plausibility of the recovered verb
The heuristic rules are given in the following
Condition   Proposal Proposal  
Proposal   Possible recovered verb Point 
Surface expressions semantic constraints refer-
ential properties etc are written as conditions in
the Condition section A possible recovered verb
is written in the Possible recovered verb section
Point means the plausibility of the possible recov-
ered verb

it is given 1 point

32 Heuristic Rule
33 Example of Verb Ellipsis Resolution
We made 22 heuristic rules for verb ellipsis resolu-
tion These rules are made by examining training
sentences in Section 41 by hand We show some
of the rules in Table 1
The value s in Rule 3 is given from the semantic
similarity between Noun X and Noun Y in EDR
concept dictionary EDR 95
The corpus linguistic data used in Rule 7 is
a set of newspapers one year about 70000000
characters The method detecting similar sen-
tences by character matching is performed by sort-
ing the corpus in advance and using a binary
search
We show an example of a verb ellipsis resolution
in Figure 3 Figure 3 shows that the verb ellipsis
in ONEGAI request was analyzed well
Since the end of the sentence is not an expres-
sion which can normally be at the end of a sen-
tence Rule 1 was not satised and the system
judged that a verb ellipsis exists By Rule 5 the
system took the candidate the end of the previ-
ous sentence Next by Rule 7 using corpus the
system took the candidate ARIMASU I have
Although there are ARU I have and ARI-
MASU I have the frequency of ARIMASU I
have is more than the others and it was selected
as a candidate The candidate ARIMASU I
have having the best score was properly judged
to be the desired recovered verb

4 Experiment and Discussion
41 Experiment
We ran the experiment on the novel BOKKO-
CHAN Hoshi 71 This is because novels con-
tain various verb ellipses In the experiment we
divided the text into training sentences and test
sentences We made heuristic rules by examining
training sentences We tested our rules by using
test sentences We show the results of verb ellipsis
resolution in Table 2
To judge whether the result is correct or not
we used the following evaluation criteria When
the recovered verb is correct even if the tense as-
pect etc are incorrect we regard it as correct
For ellipses in interrogative sentences if the sys-
tem estimates that the sentence is an interrogative
sentence we judge it to be correct When the de-
sired recovered verb appears in the context and
the recovered verb chosen by the rule using cor-
pus is nearly equal to the correct verb we judge
that it is correct
42 Discussion
As in Table 2 we obtained a recall rate of 73
and a precision rate of 66 in the estimation of
indirect anaphora on test sentences
The recall rate of In the context is higher than
that of Not in the context For In the context
the system only species the location of the recov-
ered verb But in the case of Not in the context
the system judges that the recovered verb does
not exist in the context and gathers the recovered
verb from other information Therefore Not in
the context is very dicult to analyze
The accuracy rate of Other ellipses use of
common sense was not so high But since the
analysis of the case of Other ellipses use of com-
mon sense is very dicult we think that it is
valuable to obtain a recall rate of 56 and a pre-
cision rate 59 We think that when the size of
corpus becomes larger this method becomes very
important Although we calculate the similarity
between the input sentence and the example sen-
tence in the corpus only by using simple character
matching we think that we must use the infor-
mation of semantics and the parts of speech when
calculating the similarity Moreover we must de-
tect the desired sentence by using only examples
of the type whether it is an interrogative sentence
or not whose previous sentence is the same as the
previous sentence of the input sentence
Although the accuracy rate of the category us-
ing surface expressions is already high there are
some incorrect cases which can be corrected by re-
ning the use of surface expressions in each rule
There is also a case which requires a new kind of
rule in the experiment on test sentences
SONOTOTAN WATASHI-WA HIMEI-WO KIITA
at the moment I
At the moment I heard a scream
a scream
voice
NANIKA-NI TUBUSARERUYOUNA KOE-NO
something be crushed
of a fearful voice such that he was crushed by something
In these sentences OSOROSHII KOE-NO of
a fearful voice is the supplement of OOKINA
HIMEI a scream in the previous sentence To
solve this ellipsis we need the following rule
When the end is the form of noun X 
NOof and there is a noun Z which is
semantically similar to noun Y in the ex-
amples of noun X  NOof  noun Y
the system judges that the sentence is the
supplement of noun Z
5 Conclusion
In this paper we described a practical way to re-
solve omitted verbs by using surface expressions
and examples We obtained a recall rate of 73
and a precision rate of 66 in the resolution of
verb ellipsis on test sentences The accuracy rate
of the case of recovered verb appearing in the con-
text was high The accuracy rate of the case of
using corpus examples was not so high Since
the analysis of this phenomena is very dicult we
think that it is valuable to have proposed a way
of solving the problem to a certain extent We

Precision is the fraction of the ends of the sentences which were judged to have verb ellipses Recall
is the fraction of the ends of the sentences which have the verb ellipses The reason why we use
precision and recall to evaluate is that the system judges that the ends of the sentences which do not
have the verb ellipses have the verb ellipses and we check these errors properly
think that when the size of corpus becomes larger
and the machine performance becomes greater
the method of using corpus will become eective
