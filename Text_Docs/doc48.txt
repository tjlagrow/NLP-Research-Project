Neurotransmitter receptor molecules concentrated in postsynaptic domains along with scaold
and a number of other molecules are key regulators of signal transmission across synapses Employ-
ing experiment and theory we develop a quantitative description of synaptic receptor domains in
terms of a reaction-diusion model We show that interactions between only receptor and scaold
molecules together with the rapid diusion of receptors on the cell membrane are sucient for the
formation and stable characteristic size of synaptic receptor domains Our work reconciles long-term
stability of synaptic receptor domains with rapid turnover and diusion of individual receptors

How the physiological stability necessary for memory
storage can be achieved in the presence of rapid molec-
ular turnover and diusion is a central problem in neu-
robiology 1 Synapses in particular are believed to be
the physiological seat of memory and rely on the stabil-
ity of postsynaptic domains containing neurotransmitter
receptor molecules as well as scaold and a number of
other molecules over days months or even longer peri-
ods of time 2 3 Yet recent experiments have demon-
strated that individual receptor 46 and scaold 7
9 molecules leave and enter postsynaptic domains on
typical timescales as short as minutes How can these
seemingly contradictory observationslong-term stabil-
ity and a well-dened characteristic size of postsynaptic
domains on the one hand rapid molecular turnover and
diusion on the other handbe integrated in a unied
understanding of postsynaptic domain formation and sta-
bility
Classically
it has been assumed that interactions
between presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons play a
paramount role in the stability and in setting the char-
acteristic size of synaptic receptor domains 10 Over
recent years though a number of studies 4 6 11 car-
ried out on a variety of chemical synapses have indi-
cated that molecular domains containing synaptic recep-
tor molecules may form spontaneously even in the ab-
sence of presynaptic neurons However a detailed molec-
ular understanding of the mechanism governing the for-
mation and stability of synaptic receptor domains has re-
mained elusive In this Letter we rst discuss a minimal
experimental system which enables us to determine the
molecular components essential for the self-organization
of stable receptor domains of the characteristic size ob-
served in neurons 9 12 13 On this basis we then
formulate a mathematical model of the formation and
stability of synaptic receptor domains which quantita-
tively accounts for our experimental observations and
also makes further predictions pertaining to the stability
and regulation of synaptic receptor domains
In our experiments we used single broblast cells
which are devoid of the molecular machinery commonly
associated with postsynaptic domain formation 10 but
allow for the rapid turnover and diusion of receptors
observed in neurons 4 6 as well as for interaction of
receptors with scaold molecules Fibroblast cells were
transfected 14 with glycine receptors one of the main
receptor types at inhibitory synapses and their associ-
ated scaolds gephyrin molecules 9
In our minimal
system the mere presence of both receptor and scaf-
fold molecules led to the spontaneous emergence of sta-
ble receptor-scaold domains RSDs see Fig 1ab
These domains corresponded to a joint enhancement of
the receptor and scaold molecule densities over a char-
acteristic area of 02 to 03 m2 Fig 1c Once the
RSDs were formed their mean area remained stable over
a time scale of days with little cell-to-cell variability in
the mean area of RSDs but larger variability in the mean
number of RSDs per cell Fig 1c If only receptors
were transfected in the absence of scaold molecules re-
ceptor domains did not emerge apart from possible oc-
currences of transient microdomains 12 15 If only scaf-
fold molecules were transfected in the absence of recep-
tors then these formed large intracellular blobs but no
association with the cell membrane was detected 12 16
The experiments carried out on our minimal system in-
dicate that receptor-scaold interactions together with
the diusion properties of each molecular species at the
membrane are necessary and sucient for RSD forma-
tion and stability In particular the presence of a presy-
naptic terminal is not essential for the occurrence of sta-
ble RSDs In agreement with previous studies 4 6 11
our results point to a picture in which postsynaptic do-
mains form in the absence of presynaptic stimulation
which subsequently intervenes in their maturation and
Finally the diusion properties of receptors are similar
in cells with transfected 9 and endogenous 17 scaold
molecules Thus we expect that receptors and scaolds
in neurons exhibit the necessary and sucient proper-
ties for RSD formation and stability as they do in our
experiments
We now turn to the mathematical description of our
minimal experimental system The concentration of re-
ceptors is represented by the function rx y t and that
of scaolds by the function sx y t where the variables
x and y denote coordinates along the cell membrane and
the variable t denotes time The spatiotemporal evolu-
tion of these elds is governed by the reaction-diusion
equations
 F r s  r 1  sr  rs 
 Gr s  s 1  rs  sr 
where F and G are simple cubic polynomials in r and
s that describe the reactions in our system 14 and r
and s are the receptor and scaold diusion coecients
The nonlinear corrections to the standard diusion terms
r2r and s2s in Eqs 1 and 2 arise from the con-
straint 0  r  s  1 where we have normalized r and s
so that the maximum concentration of receptors and scaf-
folds is equal to 1 and account for steric repulsion 4 6
of receptors and scaolds in the conned membrane envi-
ronment of a living cell Experimental studies 49 15 of
the diusion properties of glycine receptors and gephyrin
scaolds as well as of other types of synaptic receptors
and scaolds yield r  s
The reaction and diusion properties of receptors and
scaolds 49 15 suggest that Eqs 1 and 2 exhibit
pattern formation via a Turing instability 18 19 which
emerges from the interplay between the two molecular
species in our system Receptors diuse quickly and tend
to repel nearby molecules whereas scaolds diuse more
slowly and tend to attract nearby molecules In agree-
ment with experiments the formation of synaptic recep-
tor domains via a Turing mechanism necessarily relies
on the presence of both receptors and scaolds Expres-
sions of the reaction terms F and G in Eqs 1 and 2
are obtained from the relevant chemical interactions re-
ported previously 49 together with the general math-
ematical constraints associated with Turing instabilities
19 a point we return to below Reaction-diusion mod-
els akin to the one described here have in recent years
been used to describe molecular localization during cell
division 2022 and are to be contrasted with models
of domain formation which rely on phase separation and
coarsening 23
We simulated Eqs 1 and 2 starting from random
initial conditions with units of space and time set by the
diusion coecient of unbound receptor molecules and
the rate of receptor endocytosis Using typical values for

rons devoid of synapses domains of a comparable size

with synapses the domain size remains unchanged 13

which is in fact a general feature of our model and is also
in agreement with experimental observations 25 26
The Turing mechanism implies that RSDs attain
a steady state once a dynamical equilibrium between
strong receptor diusion and the attractive eect of scaf-
folds is reached In our simulations of Eqs 1 and 2
we found that for the diusion coecient of glycine re-
ceptors reported in experiments 46 9 15 the resulting
characteristic size of RSDs was comparable to that ob-
tained in experiments see Figs 2bc and 1c This
result necessitated only gross adjustment of the reaction
rates so that Eqs 1 and 2 would exhibit a Turing
instability but apart from that the characteristic size of
domains was found to be largely insensitive to variations
in reaction rates or indeed to the reaction kinetics con-
sidered The timescale for the formation of stable RSDs
in our simulations see Fig 2b was set by the rate of
receptor endocytosis For the measured range of values
of the rate of receptor endocytosis 4 6 8 this timescale
was also in broad agreement with experimental observa-
tions see Fig 1c Further consistency checks between
Eqs 1 and 2 and experimental results would pertain
to the geometry of domain edges the eect of changes in
diusion rates on domain size and stability and the rel-
ative extent of the enhanced concentrations of receptors
and scaolds in RSDs In particular our model predicts
that once dynamical equilibrium has set in the recep-
tor prole is wider than the scaold prole in any given
domain see Fig 2c
While in accordance with experimental observations
49 15 we allowed 14 for a variety of interactions be-
tween receptors and scaolds when simulating Eqs 1
and 2 we found that only a handful of chemical reac-
tions were crucial for the formation and stability of RSDs
via a Turing instability To lowest order these reactions
correspond to R  Rb and Rb  S  R  S for the
receptors and to S  Sb and Sb  2S  3S for the
scaolds respectively In these expressions the symbols
R and S stand for receptors and scaolds at the mem-
brane and Rb and Sb denote molecules in the bulk of the
cell In particular the reaction Sb  2S  3S in which
a scaold molecule from the bulk is adsorbed onto the
membrane by two other scaold molecules into a trimer
is key to domain formation whereas the simpler reaction
Sb  S  2S alone is not sucient
Indeed gephyrin
scaold molecules are thought to form both dimers and
trimers under the usual conditions in which neural do-
mains are observed 4 However if trimerization is pre-
vented no domains or only very small ones appear 9
The above results demonstrate how stable synaptic re-
ceptor domains can emerge in the absence of presynaptic
stimulation
In a synapse however presynaptic activ-
ity regulates 27 the concentration of receptors in the
postsynaptic domain Our reaction-diusion model sug-
gests novel mechanisms for how such regulation may be

these parameters taken from experiments 49 15 we
found that irregular patterns of stable RSDs similar to
experimental ones emerged over a timescale of hours see
Figs 2a and 1a Individual domains resulted from
a coordinated increase of receptor and scaold densities
Occasionally we observed sets of closely-spaced RSDs in
the outcomes of simulations resulting from initial ran-
dom uctuations see Figs 2ab At lower resolution
these appeared as larger than average irregularly shaped
domains reminiscent of similar instances obtained exper-
imentally see the lower panels in Fig 1b

of molecular noise in our reaction-diusion model is ex-
pected to further distort the simulated patterns with-
out changing their overall characteristics 24 Moreover

istic size observed in neurons can emerge from noth-
ing more than interactions between receptors and scaf-
folds together with the rapid diusion of receptors on
the cell membrane A reaction-diusion model quanti-
tatively accounts for our experimental results yielding
spontaneous formation of stable receptor domains and
their observed characteristic size as well as new puta-
tive mechanisms for the regulation of synaptic strength
Collectively our results show how stable synaptic recep-
tor domains may form even in the absence of presynaptic
stimulation 4 6 11 and how rapid turnover and diu-
sion of receptors 4 6 far from being a hindrance may
in fact be crucial 1 for ensuring overall stability and
delicate control of synaptic receptor domains

achieved It has been observed 8 28 that the diusion of
receptors on the postsynaptic membrane can be modied
through binding of presynaptic neurotransmitters Sim-
ilarly scaold diusion may be 29 30 modulated by
synaptic activity This suggests that local modication
of the diusion properties of receptors or scaolds may
contribute to the regulation of postsynaptic domains As
a simple phenomenological perturbation to our model
we therefore implemented pre- and postsynaptic inter-
actions through a local increase in the receptor diu-
sion rate which within the framework of our reaction-
diusion model has the same eect as a local decrease
in the scaold diusion rate
As shown in Fig 3 our model predicts that modu-
lation of receptor or scaold diusion yields a transient
increase of the in-domain receptor population following
presynaptic activity Clearly this speculative purely bio-
physical mechanism may coexist with biochemical mech-
anisms of postsynaptic plasticity Applying a few seconds
of stimulation at a time Fig 3 left panel we found
a correlation between the increase in in-domain recep-
tor population and the duration of stimulation Fig 3
right panel After an initial short-lived suppression the
population increase lasted for a few tens of secondsthe
timescale typically associated with short-term plasticity
In this window of time RSDs were richer in receptors
Fig 3 inset and hence yielded a larger synaptic ef-
cacy This phenomenon has a simple explanation in
terms of the Turing instability exhibited by our model
Enhanced diminished receptor scaold diusion de-
pletes the receptor increases the scaold population in
a transient manner which because receptors are repulsive
and scaolds are attractive in turn attracts even more
receptors and scaolds into RSDs
In summary we have used a minimal experimental
system devoid of synaptic machinery to show that neu-
rotransmitter receptor domains of the stable character-
