1 Introduction 
Recently  an  old  interest  in  the  zitterbewegung  ZB  of  the  Dirac  electron  has  been 
rekindled by the investigations on spintronics graphene and superconducting systems etc 
1-9 In particular there are important progresses in improving the predictions for detecting 
ZB and relating them to Schrodinger cats in trapped ions 10 11 On the other hand as is 
well known the Hawking radiation can be viewed from very different perspectives In this 
letter  we  present  another  perspective  on  the  Hawking  radiation  by  means  of  ZB  In  the 
following  the  natural  units  of 
cid61
  are  applied  and  the  four-dimensional  4D  flat 
space-time  metric  tensor  is  taken  as

2 Quantized-field description of the Dirac electrons ZB   
      Traditionally  the  investigations  on  ZB  have  been  developed  at  the  level  of  quantum 
mechanics  where  one  has  to  resort  to  the  concept  of  position  operator  However  at  the 
level of quantum field theory the ZB should be studied in terms of a 3D current vector or 
3D momentum vector The free Dirac field can be expressed as

  together  form  a  3D  orthonormal  basis  they  are  actually  the  spinor 
representation  of  three  linear  polarization  vectors  Because  of

  note  that

Eq 4 shows that the classical current

  is formed by electrons or positrons with the 
momentum 
  In  Eqs  5  and  6 
 c d
  are  respectively  the  creation  and 
annihilation operators of electron-positron pairs with vanishing total momentum then the 
ZB  currents 
cid38Z
  are  related  to  the  creation  and  annihilation  of  virtual 
electron-positron pairs In fact let 
A  be a 4D electromagnetic potential 
a  4D  current-density  vector  according  to  QED  in  the  electromagnetic  interaction 
let  the  unit  charge  e
  the  classical  current 
classicV
  can  contribute  to  the  Compton 
scattering  while  the  ZB  currents 
Z   and 
cid38Z
  can  contribute  to  the  Bhabha  scattering 
However in the presence of the electromagnetic interaction the vacuum is replaced with 
electromagnetic  fields  and  the  electron-positron  pairs  in  the  Bhabha  scattering  are  real 
rather than virtual ones 
Seeing  that  a  hole  in  Diracs  hole  theory  can  be  interpreted  as  a  positron  within  the 
framework  of  quantum  field  theory  the  traditional  argument  12  13  for  the  ZB  of  an 
electron in a bound or free state can be restated as follows around an original electron 
virtual  electron-positron  pairs  are  continuously  created  and  annihilated  subsequently  in 
vacuum the original electron can annihilate with the positron of a virtual pair while the 
electron of the virtual pair which is left over now replaces the original electron by such an 
exchange  interaction  the  ZB  occurs  Therefore  from  the  point  of  view  of  quantum  field 
theory  the  occurrence  of  the  ZB  for  an  electron  arises  from  the  influence  of  virtual 
electron-positron pairs or vacuum fluctuations on the electron The exchange interaction 
resulting in the Dirac electrons ZB is shown in Figure 1
Fig 1 Exchange interaction resulting in the ZB of an electron   
In  Figure  1  around  an  original  electron  with  the  initial  position  of 
  a  virtual 
electron-positron pair is created at position 
  in the vacuum its positron annihilates with 
the original electron at position 
 while its electron arriving at position 
  is left over 
and  then  replaces  the  original  electron  by  such  an  exchange  interaction  the  ZB  of  the 
electron occurs 
3 Depicting Hawking radiation in terms of ZB 
As for the occurrence of ZB the effect of electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations can be 
replaced by that of gravitational vacuum fluctuations For our purpose we regard free fields 
in a curved spacetime as the fields interacting with a gravitational field 
As  we  know  the  Hawking  radiation  can  be  viewed  from  very  different  perspectives 
Now we present another perspective on the Hawking radiation by means of ZBBased on 
Figure  1  let  us  assume  that  there  is  a  horizon  of  a  Schwarzschild  black  hole  between 
positions 
  and  rewrite  the  x-axis  as  the  r-axis  in  spherical  coordinates 
t r    for  the  moment  Figure  1  becomes  Figure  2  where 
gr   denotes  the 
Schwarzschild radius of the black hole As we know quantum theory predicts that black 
holes  emit  particles  moving  away  from  the  horizon  The  particles  are  produced  out  of 
vacuum  fluctuations  of  quantum  fields  present  around  the  black  hole  14-16  As  an 
example  let  us  assume  that  a  virtual  electron-positron  pair  is  created  at  position 
where the pairs electron moves to  r    while its positron moves to 
rr  such that 
the black hole obtains a negative-energy positron or equivalently it loses a positive-energy 
electron As result one can present the black hole evaporation with an equivalent picture as 
shown  in  Fig  2  now  that  the  process  that  the  black  hole  absorbs  a  negative-energy 
antiparticle is equivalent to that the black hole loses a positive-energy particle let us assume 
that  from  the  very  beginning  there  is  a  positive-energy  particle  as  the  original  particle 
inside  the  black  hole  its  original  position  satisfies 
r  naturally  afterward  at  another 
position 
  say  it  annihilates  with  the  negative-energy  antiparticle  of  a  virtual 
particle-antiparticle pair created at position 
r  which is equivalent to that the original 
particle  is  replaced  by  the  virtual  pairs  particle  that  moves  away  from  the  horizon  to 
r  
 That is the black holes particle at position 
r   is vaporized in the form of ZB 
comparing Fig 2 with Fig 1 Therefore the Hawking radiation can also be viewed from 
the perspective of ZB Though Fig 2 shows that 
  one may also have

4 Conclusions   
At the level of quantum field theory the ZB of the Dirac electron can be studied more 
exactly  by  which  one  can  show  that  the  ZB  is  due  to  vacuum  fluctuations  eg  an 
electromagnetic or gravitational vacuum fluctuations and its vector property is described 
by  the  spinor  representation  of  three  linear  polarization  vectors  In  particular  Hawking 
radiation can also be viewed from the perspective of ZB
