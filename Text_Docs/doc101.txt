ABSTRACT
We present the luminosity function and selection function of 60 m galaxies selected
from the Imperial IRAS-FSC Redshift Catalogue IIFSCz Three methods including
the 1Vmax and the parametric and non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator
are used and results agree well with each other A density evolution  1  z3409 or
a luminosity evolution  exp17 tL  where tL is the look-back time is detected in
the full sample in the redshift range 002 01 consistent with previous analyses Of
the four infrared subpopulations cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts show
similar evolutionary trends galaxies with signicant AGN contributions show stronger
positive evolution and Arp 220-type starbursts exhibit strong negative evolution The
dominant subpopulation changes from cirrus-type galaxies to M82-type starbursts at
log10L60L  103
In the second half of the paper we derive the projected two-point spatial correla-
tion function for galaxies of dierent infrared template type The mean relative bias
between cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type starbursts which correspond to quiescent
galaxies with optically thin interstellar dust and actively star-forming galaxies respec-
tively is calculated to be bcirrusbM82  125  007 The relation between current
star formation rate SFR in star-forming galaxies and environment is investigated
by looking at the the dependence of clustering on infrared luminosity We found that
M82-type actively star-forming galaxies show stronger clustering as infrared luminos-
ity  SFR increases The correlation between clustering strength and SFR in the local
Universe seems to echo the basic trend seen in star-forming galaxies in the Great

INTRODUCTION
The study of galaxy distribution on large scales  10 h1
Mpc where density uctuations are still in the linear regime
  1 has been an important tool in constraining cos-
mological models However the unknown relationship be-
tween the distribution of dark matter and that of luminous
objects usually referred to as galaxy bias has complicated
the extraction of cosmological parameters especially when
we compare results from surveys of dierent galaxy subpop-
ulations or of varying depths At small scales  1 h1 Mpc
where nonlinear eects become important detailed studies
of galaxy bias can improve our understanding of galaxy for-
mation and evolution which is still unclear due to the con-
 E-mail lingyuwangsussexacuk
volution of gravitational evolution and complex astrophys-
ical processes eg gas cooling fragmentation star forma-
tion feedback This paper attempts to measure the relative
galaxy bias over the intermediate scale 1  10 Mpc ie the
weakly nonlinear scale as we are constrained by low galaxy
density at small scales
Several models of galaxy bias have been developed over
the past 20 years or so The simplest one is to assume galax-
ies trace the underlying mass in a linear deterministic way
g  bm where g and m is the galaxy and matter density
perturbation or contrast eld and b is the linear bias pa-
rameter In the peaks bias model Kaiser 1984 Bardeen et
al 1986 the relationship between the correlation function
of galaxies and that of the underlying dark matter satises
gr  b2mr based on statistics of the density peaks
in a Gaussian random eld On large scales it seems rea-
L Wang and M Rowan-Robinson
sonable to assume a scale independent linear galaxy bias if
galaxies form in virialized dark matter halos On interme-
diate and small scales the situation is more complicated
In more realistic galaxy bias models b is thought to be
time-varying scale-dependent non-local or even stochas-
tic to some extent N-body simulations of dark matter and
semi-analytic models of galaxy formation predict a scale-
dependent relation between galaxies and dark matter due to
the mass-dependence of galaxy formation eciency as well
as a luminosity-dependent bias for galaxies with luminosities
above L Benson et al 2000 Benson et al 2001 Attempts
to understand galaxy bias have also been made in the halo
occupation distribution HOD framework where the rela-
tionship between the galaxy distribution and the underlying
dark matter is encoded in the conditional probability func-
tion P N M  which gives the number of galaxies of a given
type in a halo of virial mass M Jing et al 1998 Ma  Fry

Observationally several manifestations of galaxy bias
are known From dipole analysis dierent values of the

m b parameter have been reported using dierent
types of mass tracer Rowan-Robinson et al 2000 Ko-
cevski Mullis  Ebeling 2004 Erdogdu et al 2006 and refer-
ences therein The well-known morphology-density relation
Dressler 1980 Goto et al 2003 states that late-type galax-
ies disk-dominated prefer low density regions and early-
type bulge-dominated galaxies dominate in dense cluster
cores There is also a correlation between colour and mor-
phology the majority of blue galaxies are late-type galaxies
while red galaxies are mostly early-type galaxies as well as
a correlation between colour and luminosity red galaxies are
systematically more luminous than blue galaxies There-
fore galaxy clustering is expected to be dependent on phys-
ical properties such as morphology colour surface bright-
ness and luminosity Using a total of over 100 000 galaxies
from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dFGRS Norberg et
al 2001 found a scale-independent luminosity dependence
of galaxy bias of the form bb  085  015LL which
means the luminosity-dependence is conspicuous above L
It agrees with the conclusions of Benoist et al 1996 based
upon 3600 galaxies selected from the Southern Sky Red-
shift Survey 2 at the faint end but it exhibits a less steep
rise at the bright end Zehavi et al 2002 2005 studied
galaxy clustering in the SDSS which not only conrmed
the conclusions of Norberg et al 2001 but also probed
the relative bias behaviour to fainter galaxies Madgwick et
al 2003 divided their sample from the 2dFGRS into rel-
atively passive and active star-forming galaxy subsamples
A scale-dependent relative bias was found in comparing the
clustering strength of the two subsamples On scales smaller
than 8 h1 Mpc the relative bias between the two spec-
tral classes is bpassivebactive  145  014 On scales larger
than 10 h1 Mpc the relative bias reduces to unity Zehavi
et al 2002 2005 used a luminosity-dependent colour-cut
to divide their volume-limited sample from the SDSS The
colour-dependence of the correlation function is found to
be very similar to that found in Madgwick et al 2003
In addition the luminosity-dependence for red galaxies is
such that both faint and luminous red galaxies cluster more
strongly than moderately bright red galaxies around L
while a luminosity-dependence for blue galaxies is not no-
ticeable Wang et al 2007 Swanson et al 2008 Cresswell

The optical colour of a galaxy is connected with a com-
plicated combination of star formation history and current
star formation rate SFR In contrast it is well known that
the far-infrared emission is a good SFR indicator due to
the re-processing of starlight by dust So in principle one
can measure clustering strength of infrared galaxies to learn
about the relation between environment and SFR So far
little is known about the clustering of infrared galaxies and
its dependence on various physical parameters The largest
sample of local infrared galaxies is provided by IRAS The
correlation length of IRAS galaxies r0  4 h1 Mpc is
similar to that of local star-formingblue galaxies found in
the SDSS and 2dFGRS Saunders et al 1992 Fisher et al
1994 Clustering measurements of infrared galaxies did not
show signicant dependence on infrared luminosity Beis-
bart  Kerscher 2000 Szapudi et al 2000 Hawkins et al
2001 This was thought to be a result of the combined ef-
fect of the dark matter halo mass and SFR in determining
the far-infrared luminosity From the SFR - density relation
we know that star-forming galaxies preferentially reside in
low density environments Gomez et al 2003 On the other
hand the gas content in a galaxy is largely dependent on the
mass of the host dark matter halo The dependence of clus-
tering on infrared galaxy types is not entirely clear either
With a few thousand galaxies in the QDOT IRAS galaxy
redshift survey Lawrence et al 1999 Mann Saunders 
Taylor 1996 did not detect any signicant variation in the
clustering of warm and cool IRAS galaxies separated by the
far-infrared emission temperature above or below 36 K re-
spectively assuming the far-infrared spectrum can be tted
by S  B T  Hawkins et al 2001 using the much big-
ger IRAS PSCz sample Saunders et al 2000 found that
the relative bias between cool and warm infrared galaxies is
around 15 on scales between 1 and 10 h1 Mpc
Our aim is to investigate the relation between star for-
mation activity in star-forming galaxies and environment
using infrared samples in the general eld in the local Uni-
verse We study the clustering dependence on infrared lumi-
nosity and infrared template type taking advantage of a new
redshift catalogue of over 60000 galaxies selected at 60 m
from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog FSC The remain-
der of this paper is organised as follows Section 2 briey
describes the galaxy sample used Details of the new cata-
logue can be found in Wang  Rowan-Robinson 2009 In
Section 3 we derive the luminosity function and the selec-
tion function using various methods which will then be used
to construct random catalogues in measuring the clustering
signal with ux-limited samples In Section 4 clustering de-
pendence on infrared template type and infrared luminosity
is investigated using the projected two-point spatial corre-
lation function Finally discussions and conclusions are pre-
sented in Section 5 Throughout the paper unless otherwise
stated we assume H0  72 km s1 Mpc1 and a at uni-

2 THE GALAXY SAMPLE
The Imperial IRAS-FSC Redshift Catalogue IIFSCz Wang
 Rowan-Robinson 2008 is a recently constructed cata-
logue containing 60303 galaxies selected at 60 m from the
IRAS FSC The IIFSCz covers most of the sky at b  20
 61 of the entire sky 55 of the sources have spectro-
scopic redshifts obtained from past redshift surveys and a
further 20 have optical near-infrared andor radio iden-
tications for which photometric redshifts were estimated
through the training set or template-tting method We also
determine the best-t infrared template for each galaxy with
either spectroscopic or photometric redshift Fig 1 shows
the main four infrared template types infrared cirrus dust
emission due to the interstellar radiation eld M82 star-
burst interaction-induced starburst AGN dust torus emis-
sion and Arp 220 starburst merger-induced starburst
The intrinsic 90 completeness limit of the IRAS
FSC is at around F60  036 Jy In order to reduce
incompleteness-induced problems we have selected a sam-
ple of around 22500 galaxies with F60  036 Jy At this
ux limit around 75 of our sample have spectroscopic red-
shifts 15 have photometric redshifts and 10 do not have
any redshift estimates Almost all galaxies in areas covered
by the SDSS DR6 survey have redshift either spectroscopic
or photometric Thus the redshift completeness is a spa-
tially varying function and this is taken into account in this
We convert heliocentric redshift to redshift in the Local
Group frame Redshifts are used as distance indicators with-
out corrections for peculiar motions In consequence we do
not include galaxies below redshift z  0003 for which z is
a poor estimate of the distance in our sample In Fig 2 the
redshift distribution of galaxies in our sample is plotted in
comparison with galaxies in the IRAS PSCz Fig 3 shows
the normalised redshift distribution for each infrared galaxy
type in our sample
Cirrus-type galaxies are mainly found in the local Uni-
verse z  006 while the other three types are more com-
mon at relatively high redshift So cirrus-type galaxies are
almost absent at the high luminosity end This transition
in the predominant subpopulation in the mixture across the
redshift or luminosity range is important in understanding
the clustering dependence on luminosity for the full sample
We will return to this point in Section 4
3 THE LUMINOSITY AND SELECTION
FUNCTION
The selection function Sz hereafter SF of a ux-limited
survey is dened as the mean comoving number density of
galaxies that can be observed at redshift z It is the inte-
gration of the luminosity function L hereafter LF at
redshift z which species the luminosity distribution of the
galaxy population observed in the survey
Sz Z 
Lminz
zLdL
where Lminz is the minimum luminosity a galaxy at redshift
z can have in order to remain above the ux limit The
inherent assumption is that the LF does not depend on the

local density eld However it has been known for some
time that the LF is dependent on galaxy type which is in
turn related to the environment Therefore the assumption
that the bivariate distribution function of luminosity and
position is separable is not strictly valid

31 Methods
The LF is of fundamental importance in constraining mod-
els of galaxy formation and evolution Various techniques
have been proposed to measure it such as the maximum-
volume estimator 1Vmax Schmidt 1968 and the paramet-
ric Sandage Tammann  Yahil 1979 hereafter STY and
non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator Efstathiou
Ellis  Peterson 1988 Springel  White 1998 hereafter
SW98 The 1Vmax method assumes a uniform number den-
sity throughout the observed volume and therefore is vul-
nerable to density inhomogeneities present in a survey The
maximum likelihood estimators have the advantage of being
insensitive to any local clustering eect but lose information
on the overall normalisation
The STY method requires a prior knowledge of the
appropriate functional
form of the LF The probability
of a source at redshift zi having luminosity in the range
Li Li  dL is
pLizi 
Lminzi 
nzi Li
nzi LdL
zi Li
In Bayesian statistics the posterior probability of the pa-
rameters characterising the LF given the data is propor-
tional to the likelihood function ie the probability of the
data given the parameters assuming a uniform prior prob-
ability of the parameters Therefore the best-t parameters
in the LF are the ones which maximise the likelihood given
pLizi
Saunders et al 1990 hereafter S90 using the STY
method determined the present-epoch 60 m LF from 2818
IRAS galaxies which is a Gaussian combined with a power

L  10847 h2 L Note that L is dened as the LF

from the expected number density of sources with F60  06
Jy per unit solid angle
The parametric maximum likelihood technique does not
have an intrinsic measure of goodness-of-t Therefore a
non-parametric approach is needed to justify the functional
form of the LF or the closely related SF SW98 proposed a
non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator which adopts
stepwise power laws to characterise the SF

Most of the previous estimates in the literature have de-
rived the K-correction term by assuming a power-law spec-
trum of the form S   2 although in some papers people
have tried other methods such as a grey-body model con-
strained by the 60-100 m ux ratio In light of Fig 1 this
assumption may not seem very problematic over a narrow
redshift range except for AGN dust tori Fig 4 compares
the K-corrected 60 m luminosity derived from the best-t
infrared template1 for each galaxy with that derived from a
S   2 spectrum over the redshift range 0003 6 z 6 40
without evolution correction As expected the dierence be-
tween the two luminosity estimates is small except for AGNs
at relatively high redshifts
32 Evolution
A similar maximum likelihood approach can be used to de-
termine the evolution of the LF S90 Fisher et al 1992
For pure density evolution parametrised in Eq 6 the evo-
lutionary rate P can be found by maximising the likelihood
of observing galaxies at positions r1 r2  respectively that

The above method known as the constant-density
method is strongly aected by density inhomogeneities in
the analysed sample Therefore a lower redshift limit is usu-
ally used to reduce this eect which is strongest in the local
Universe Table 1 is a compilation of our estimates of P in
various redshift bins in an Einstein-de Sitter to facilitate
Figure 5 The 1Vmax 60 m LF derived for the full sample in
3 redshift bins without evolution correction To increase the con-
trast between LFs in dierent redshift bins we have normalised
the LF by Saunders et als estimate of the present-day LF ie
comparison with others or CDM model and previous es-
timates Using the constant-density method S90 detected a
strong density evolution P  67  23 Eq 6 It was con-
rmed from source number counts in the deep IRAS Faint
Source Survey FSS data base at b  50 Lonsdale et al
1990 However Fisher et al 1992 found no evidence for
evolution in their sample of 5297 IRAS galaxies ux-limited
at 12 Jy at 60 m Oliver et al 1995 found P  56 in a
spectroscopic sample of around 2000 galaxies with F60  02
Jy Bertin Dennefeld  Moshir 1997 also found evidence
to support strong evolution in a deep subsample of the IRAS
FSS at a ux limit of F60  011 Jy using several methods
such as background uctuations ie confusion noise num-
ber counts and optical identication rate SW98 developed a
minimum variance estimator which is less aected by density
inhomogeneities and re-analysed the 12 Jy sample2 They
claimed a milder evolution P  43 in the IRAS galaxies
The IRAS 1 Jy survey of ULIRGs ultraluminous infrared
galaxies with Lir  1012L showed a strong evolution Kim
 Sanders 1998 Takeuchi Yoshikawa  Ishii 2003 applied
the constant-density method to the IRAS PSCz and found
P  34 consistent with SW98
33 Result and discussion
Although evolution seems to be detected in most cases
there is disagreement in the literature about the magni-
tude of evolution The value of P does not vary much
between an Einstein-de Sitter and CDM model over the
limited redshift range examined here However it depends
quite strongly on the redshift boundaries of the sample Our
1 For galaxies which are detected at 60 m only around 13 of
the whole sample we have assumed a power-law spectrum of the
form S  2
2 The sample used in Fisher et al 1992 was an early version
The nal version was used in the re-analysis by SW98

als estimate of the present-day LF Eq 4 to increase the contrast between LFs in dierent bins Arp 220-type galaxies exhibit strong
negative evolution For galaxies with signicant AGN contributions there seems to be some indications of strong positive evolution
although the error bars are too big for it to be conclusive Cirrus- and M82-type galaxies show similar weak positive evolutionary trend
Because the redshift range is quite narrow the eect of evolution is not obvious In Fig 9 we show that LF derived from maximum
likelihood method assuming a luminosity evolution of Q  17 Eq 13 describes both cirrus and M82 type reasonably well indicating
that the two types have similar evolutionary trends
adopted value is P  34 derived from the redshift interval
002 01 in which the sample is expected to be relatively
complete and less aected by the peculiar velocity eld The
pure density evolution can be replaced by pure luminosity
evolution with Q  17 Eq 13 In Fig 5 the 1Vmax LFs
of the full sample are shown in three redshift bins within
redshift z  02 We have corrected for the fact that both
the rst faintest and last brightest luminosity bins are
usually biased low Evolution is clearly seen3 and the mag-
nitude of evolution is consistent with that derived from the
maximum likelihood method
Galaxy evolution as a function of infrared template type
is also investigated Fig 6 shows the LFs derived for each in-
frared galaxy population in three bins in the redshift range
002 02 Apart from Arp 220-type starbursts all other
types seem to experience dierent degrees of positive evo-
lution4 As a result the dependence of P on the redshift
3 If there is positive evolution higher redshift points appear
above the lower redshift points in the luminosity range where
they overlap If there is negative evolution the reverse is true
Eg for density evolution positive evolution means that number
density decreases with time or increases with redshift
4 In Fig 9 it can be clearly seen that a pure luminosity evolution
of magnitude Q17 derived from the whole sample using maxi-
mum likelihood method ts the evolution in both cirrus and M82
subpopulations quite well AGN dust tori show stronger evolution
than that of cirrus and M82 while Arp 220 - type galaxies have
an opposite trend of evolution

Equation 16 Right The non-parametric SF solid line versus the best-t analytic SF dashed line The normalisation is derived from
the number density of galaxies with F60  036 Jy per unit solid angle
range is perhaps due to the varying fraction of each infrared
subpopulation which undergoes dierent evolutionary trend
The apparent negative evolution of the A220-type starbursts
at low redshift is interesting and perhaps indicates the era of
major merger events has ended However we do not exclude
the possibility that the very dierent evolutionary trend seen
in A220-type starbursts a very small fraction of the whole
infrared population might be caused by incorrect classica-
tion Presumably A220-type starbursts show strong positive
evolution at higher redshift as a result of higher merger rate
Interestingly this negative evolution at low redshift is pre-
dicted in the source count model of Rowan-Robinson 2009

The faint end of the 1Vmax LF is problematic as this
method is sensitive to density inhomogeneities which are
more pronounced in the very local Universe The non-
parametric LF derived from the non-parametric SF shows
a good agreement with the estimate from S90 and our esti-
mate using the STY method Our best-t parameters in the
LF parametrised in Eq 4 are
the distribution of photometric redshift is a Gaussian5 we
can use Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the uncertainty
in the LF induced by photometric redshift error
We have created 100 realisations of the ux-limited sam-
ple in the redshift range 0003 6 z 6 02 with photomet-
ric redshifts replaced by random numbers generated from
a Gaussian distribution   002 centred at the original
photometric redshift estimate we then derive the 1Vmax
LF for each realisation The resulting rms scatter is at most
7 mean scatter 4 Compared to the Poisson error 45
at most mean scatter 10 we will neglect the uncertainty
induced by the inaccuracy of the photometric redshifts

Therefore our best-estimate LF using the STY method has
a steeper faint end than that of S90 and a higher charac-
teristic luminosity L The normalisation is obtained via a

The right panel of Fig 8 shows the 1Vmax LF in the
redshift range 02 6 z 6 40 corrected for a pure luminos-
ity evolution of Q  17 Again it is compared with the
present-day LF of S90 The LF begins to atten at around
L60  10130L which might be due to signicant evo-
lution or a new infrared galaxy population arising at red-
shift z  02 We have subsequently obtained 99 hours on
ESO VLT to do spectroscopy for these ultraluminous in-
frared galaxies ULIRGs and hyperluminous infrared galax-
ies HLIRGs The nature of these objects will be discussed
in future papers
The present-day LF for each infrared subpopulation is
plotted in Fig 9 assuming a common evolution for all tem-
plate types Although Fig 6 suggests dierent rates of evolu-
tion for dierent spectral types the samples of the Arp 220-
type starbursts and AGN dust tori were not large enough to
determine their rate of evolution reliably we can see that at
the low luminosity end cirrus-type galaxies dominate while
M82 starbursts dominate at the high luminosity end at least
up to 1012L The subpopulation of AGN and Arp 220-
type starbursts exhibit large deviations from the evolution
derived for the full sample reinforcing the conclusion drawn
from Fig 6

the galaxies in the IIFSCz have photometric redshifts ob-
tained through the empirical training set for galaxies with

number of random galaxies in each grid of the sky accord-
ing to the redshift completeness so that regions with higher
redshift completeness will have more random galaxies
The well known redshift-space distortions consist of
small-scale elongation ngers-of-God eect and large-scale
compression of structures along the line-of-sight The former
is due to random motions in virialized systems while the lat-
ter is caused by coherent motions of galaxies towards over-
dense regions To derive the real-space correlation function

Due to the correlated nature of the correlation function at
dierent separations Poisson error may seriously underesti-
mate the true uncertainties in the correlation function To
determine the covariance of our data we use the bootstrap
resampling technique Ling Frenk  Barrow 1986 to create
a series of data sets

43 The luminosity dependence of clustering
The infrared emission of galaxies comes from dust emission
associated with regions of active star formation as well as
the general interstellar radiation eld Luminous infrared
galaxies are often starbursts or dust-enshrouded AGN As
a result the FIR luminosity is expected to be an excel-
lent SFR tracer for strong compact dusty starbursts but
is less reliable for the disks of normal galaxies where radi-
ation from old stars contribute signicantly to the heating
of dust Helou 1986 Kennicutt 1988 Rowan-Robinson et
al 1997 In this paper we use the 60 micron luminosity to
derive SFR Rowan-Robinson et al 1997

where   23 is the adopted fraction of UV light absorbed
by dust
Previous studies using smaller samples were unable to
detect any luminosity-dependence of the clustering ampli-
tude possibly due to the contrasting eects of the dark
matter halo mass and specic star formation rate SSFR
on determining the far-infrared luminosity7 Based upon the
luminosity - colour correlation and the colour dependence of
the correlation function Hawkins et al 2001 proposed a
luminosity-dependence of the form
log10s0  0028 log10L60  095
where s0 is the correlation length in the redshift space So
unlike optical galaxies they found a weaker correlation for
infrared galaxies of higher luminosity but their result is of
low statistical signicance However there might be a prob-
lem with their estimate because they used the redshift-space
correlation function The eect of redshift distortion at the
scale we are interested in tends to boost the clustering signal
and it is worse for nearby samples where peculiar velocities

along the line-of-sight are not negligible Thus the correla-
tion length derived from redshift-space correlation function
will be higher than the true value for nearby samples It is
also important to bear in mind that Eq 35 was proposed
to describe the luminosity-dependence for the full sample
including both cirrus and M82 type Therefore it is not re-
ally relevant to the question we are trying to address in this
paper ie the relation between SFR and environment for
star-forming galaxies
To investigate the luminosity dependence of galaxy clus-
tering and at what range it occurs the IIFSCz is divided
into nested volume-limited subsamples In Table 2 we have
listed redshift range 60 m luminosity threshold mean 60
m luminosity number of galaxies in the sample correlation
length r0 in the real-space power-law index  the bolo-
metric infrared luminosity derived from the best-t infrared
template and SFR derived from Eq 34 We also extract
volume-limited samples of cirrus-type galaxies and M82-type
starbursts In Fig 10 the relative bias dened by Eq 30 with
  3 Mpc is plotted against the mean 60 micron luminos-
ity L60 for each subsample in Table 2 The error bars are
the rms scatter derived from 25 bootstrap realisations The
empty stars and the lled stars represent the relative bias
for cirrus and M82 subsamples respectively The open cir-
cles show the relative bias of the full sample which closely
follow the relative bias of cirrus-type galaxies at low lumi-
nosities log10L60  103 and then M82-type starbursts at
higher luminosities This behaviour of the whole sample is
expected as we have already seen from Fig 3 and Fig 9
that cirrus-type galaxies is the dominant subpopulation at
low redshift  luminosity and then M82-type starbursts take
over at around log10L60  103
For cirrus-type quiescent galaxies dust emission caused
by old stellar population contributes signicantly to the in-
frared emission and thus the derived SFR are subject to
large uncertainties To study the relation between current
star formation activity and environment it is more relevant
to look at the clustering of M82-type starbursts as a function
of infrared luminosity In Fig 10 we can see that the cor-
relation strength correlates tightly with SFR for M82-type
starbursts The thick solid line is the best-tting straight
line of the SFR - clustering strength correlation Possible
cause for this tight correlation will be discussed in Section
45 where our result is compared with clustering of star-
forming galaxies in the distance Universe at z  1
44 The infrared template type dependence of
clustering
The top panel of Fig 1 in Wang  Rowan-Robinson 2008
shows the ratio of F100 and F60 as a function of spectro-
scopic redshift compared with predictions based on four in-
frared templates At redshift z  12 cirrus-type quiescent
galaxies generally have cooler FIR colours than M82 star-
bursts In Hawkins et al 2001 cold galaxies are dened by
F100F60  23 which are essentially cirrus-type galaxies in
our sample The colour-luminosity correlation means galax-
ies of dierent colour will preferentially be found in dierent
volumes To reduce the eect of cosmic variance and lumi-
nosity dependence of clustering see the previous section
we need to compare subsamples of cirrus-type galaxies and
M82 starbursts corresponding to cooler and hotter galaxies
respectively in the same volume redshift range and same
luminosity bin
L Wang and M Rowan-Robinson
Figure 10 Relative bias for volume-limited samples listed in Table 2 as a function of 60 micron luminosity The relative bias is calculated
using Eq 30 and   3 Mpc The error bars are derived from 25 bootstrap realisations of each subsample At log10L60  103 cirrus-
type galaxies dominate in number see Fig 9 so galaxy clustering of the whole sample open circles follows that of cirrus-type empty
stars At higher luminosities log10L60  103 M82-type starbursts start to dominate and the clustering of the full sample is almost
the same as that of M82-type starbursts The thick solid line is the best-t straight line of the luminosity-dependence of clustering for
M82-type starbursts which clearly exhibits a correlation between SFR and clustering strength

Already in Fig10 we can see that cirrus-type galaxies
have larger relative bias than M82-type starburst in all lu-
minosity bins Fig 11 compares the projected two-point cor-
relations functions of the two infrared subpopulations The
top row shows  for selected volume-limited samples of
the two types listed in Table 2 The selection is based on the
number of galaxies to ensure that we are not comparing very
noisy correlation functions Similarly the bottom row shows
the  for selected ux-limited samples of the two types
listed in Table 3 Dierence in clustering strength between
cirrus and M82 is clearly present in the sense that cirrus-type
galaxies are more strongly clustered than M82 starbursts
We can also derive the correlation lengths with xed power-
law index   18 for subsamples of cirrus and M82-type
galaxies listed in Table 2 and the relative bias is calculated to
be bcirrusbM82  125  007 on scales 2 6 r 6 13 h1
72 Mpc
At scales larger than 10 Mpc there is some indication that
the relative bias between the two infrared types decreases

Our result is consistent with the conclusions of Hawkins et
al 2001 that cooler galaxies cluster more strongly than
hotter galaxies
The clustering dependence on infrared template type is
perhaps analogous to the colour or optical spectral type
dependence found in optical galaxies Madgwick et al 2003
Zehavi et al 2002 2005 Wang et al 2007 Cresswell  Perci-
val 2009 Ma et al 2009 It suggests that the bulk of infrared
luminosity for the two types cirrus and M82 arises from
dierent sources The FIR emission of cirrus-type galaxies
could be mainly due to dust heated by the general interstel-
lar radiation eld where old stars dominate Given the local
SFR - density relation star-forming galaxies are preferen-
tially found in low-density regions and so it is expected that
the clustering strength of M82-like starbursts is weaker than
that of cirrus-type quiescent galaxies
45 Comparison with the distant Universe z  1
At z  1  Cooper et al 2006 found luminous blue galaxies
in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey are found in environ-
ments with greater overdensity There are also evidence that
clustering strength of star-forming galaxies correlates with
SFR in the distant Universe Gilli et al 2007 used star-
forming galaxies detected at 24 micron by SpitzerMIPS
in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey GOODS
elds to measure the spatial clustering They found galaxies
of higher infrared luminosity have a larger correlation length
than less luminous ones It indicates that more intensive star
formation is hosted by more massive dark matter halos
The stronger clustering of star-forming galaxies with
higher SFR detected in the distant Universe can be ex-
plained by the tight correlation between SFR and stellar
mass Noeske et al 2007 Elbaz et al 2007 assuming more
massive galaxies generally reside in more massive dark mat-
ter halos However because the SFR - stellar mass relation
is also valid in the local Universe we should expect a sim-
ilar correlation between clustering strength and SFR which
is exactly what we see in the clustering dependence on in-
frared luminosity for M82-type starbursts the solid line in

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We have derived the luminosity function and selection func-
tion of the IIFSCz to learn about the evolution of infrared
galaxies To minimize the eect of incompleteness we chose
a ux limit of 036 Jy at 60 m Either a pure density evo-
lution P  34 or pure luminosity evolution Q  17 is
detected in the full sample using the maximum likelihood
method The magnitude of evolution is at the lower end of
previous estimates The value of P shows some dependence
on the redshift boundaries which might be caused by dif-
ferent mixtures of infrared subpopulations which have very
dierent evolutionary trends The present-epoch 60 m lu-
minosity function derived from galaxies in the redshift range
0003  z  02 shows good agreement with the luminosity
function from Saunders et al 1990 However the lumi-
nosity function derived from galaxies in the redshift range
02  z  40 shows evidence for much stronger evolution
or possibly an entirely new class of infrared galaxies of high
luminosity emerging at redshift z  02 Follow-up spec-
troscopy studies will investigate further the population at
the high luminosity end
The spatial clustering of galaxies as a function of galaxy
properties such as type and luminosity provides strong con-
straints on models of galaxy formation and evolution In
particular the clustering of the infrared galaxies contains
essential information on the relation between star forma-
tion activity and environment We use the projected corre-
lation function  which is free from redshift-space dis-
tortion to study the clustering dependence on infrared tem-
plate type and infrared luminosity When comparing clus-
tering strength between the two infrared subpopulations
we found that cirrus-type galaxies cluster more strongly
than M82 starbursts in all luminosity bins until the cirrus-
population becomes absent at high luminosityredshift The
average relative bias between the two infrared populations is
bcirrusbM82  125007 on scales 2 6 r 6 13 h1
72 Mpc This
is consistent with the SFR - density relation which states
that star-forming galaxies preferentially reside in low den-
sity environments The dependence of clustering strength on
SFR using infrared luminosity as a proxy is investigated
using M82-type starbursts We detect a correlation between
SFR and clustering strength which follows the basic trend
found in the distant Universe at z  1 It can probably be
explained by the tight correlation between SFR and stellar
mass which holds at the local Universe as well as z  1 and
possibly z  2 However the trend that the SFR increases
with clustering strength must becomes invalid at some point
as we do not nd galaxies with the highest SFR in environ-
ments of highest density such as centres of rich clusters
in the local Universe The two seemingly inconsistent state-
ments the SFR - density relation and the correlation be-
tween SFR and clustering strength can be reconciled if the
latter operates mainly in the low density regime and be-
comes invalid once the density exceeds a certain threshold
Direct measurement of the infrared emission of galaxies
is crucial to measuring SFR of distant galaxies We hope to
extend our study of the relation between SFR and environ-
ment to higher redshift using surveys such as SWIRE and
COSMOS Observations to be made by the Herschel satellite
will undoubtedly provide more insight
