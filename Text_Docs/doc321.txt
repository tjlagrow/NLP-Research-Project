ABSTRACT
A constant age population of blue galaxies postulated in the model of
Gronwall  Koo 1995 seems to provide an attractive explanation of the excess
of very blue galaxies in the deep galaxy counts Such a population may be
generated by a set of galaxies with cycling star formation rates or at the other
extreme be maintained by the continual formation of new galaxies which fade
after they reach the age specied in the Gronwall and Koo model For both
of these hypotheses we have calculated the luminosity functions including the
respective selection criteria the redshift distributions and the number counts in
the BJ and K bands We nd a substantial excess in the number of galaxies at
low redshift 0  z  005 over that observed in the CFH redshift survey Lilly
et al 1995 and at the faint end of the Las Campanas luminosity function Lin
et al 1996 Passive or mild evolution fails to account for the deep galaxy counts
because of the implications for low redshift determinations of the I-selected
redshift distribution and the r-selected luminosity function in samples where the
faded counterparts of the star-forming galaxies would be detectable

Introduction
That the deep galaxy counts require an extensive blue population of faint galaxies
is undisputed A variety of dierent models invoke large scale merging or new galactic
 2 
populations to explain this excess Others claim that this excess can be explained simply
with mild essentially passive evolution and that the introduction of merging and new
populations is unnecessary eg Gronwall  Koo 1995 hereinafter GK Pozzetti Bruzual
 Zamorani 1996 In particular GK provide an attractive explanation of the deep galaxy
counts by determining the local luminosity functions LFs for galaxies in 11 dierent
morphological classes so as to also t the galaxy redshift distributions and broadband
colors For eight of the eleven morphological classes GK allow the luminosities and
colors of the galaxies to evolve in a way that is consistent with their construction of their
morphological classes GK require that the remaining three classes be very blue and
completely non-evolving Maintaining this population of blue galaxies requires either the
continual formation of blue galaxies in which case a remnant of fading galaxies would be
left or a cycling star formation rate in these galaxies in which case the colors would not
seem to be the same unless there was a signicant amount of time between bursts Babul
 Ferguson 1995 In this paper we impose the aforementioned physical interpretations on
the non-physical blue galaxies in the GK model and we assess their credibility
2 Results
In our physical interpretations of the GK model we maintain GKs population of
non-physical blue galaxies from z  0 to z  1 We believe that z  1 is early enough to
account for a predominance of blue galaxies seen at faint magnitudeswhich the GK model
attempts to explain with a population of non-physical blue galaxiesbut not so early as
to produce an unreasonably high number of faded galaxies We interspersed periods of
constant star formation of duration equal to that given by GK for the non-physical blue
galaxies with periods of no star formation If the B-V colors specied for the non-physical
blue galaxies in the GK model are not to be more than 010 magnitude dierent from the
colors specied in the GK model during the active star formation phase we nd that the
periods of no star formation have to be at least 12 Gyr for GKs bluest morphological type
and 20 Gyr for GKs second bluest morphological type
We consider four models which bear out a range of dierent physical interpretations
of the GK models In Model A the bluest class of galaxies corresponding to class 1 of the
GK model undergoes a period of constant star formation for 04 Gyr followed by a 12 Gyr
period with no star formation and repeats this cycle indenitely The second bluest class
of galaxies corresponding to class 2 of the GK model undergoes a period of constant star
formation for 2 Gyr followed by a 2 Gyr period with no star formation and again repeats
this cycle indenitely Models B C and D are similar to model A except the bluest class of
 3 
galaxies have 24 Gyr 48 Gyr and an innite period of time respectively separating the
bursts of star formations and the second bluest class of galaxies have 6 Gyr 12 Gyr and
an innite period of time respectively separating the bursts of star formation To maintain
this constant population of young blue galaxies in the GK model we employed several sets
of these galaxies with the star formation timed so that exactly one set of these galaxies
would be undergoing their burst of constant star formation at any given time Obviously
in models where galaxies cycle more frequently a much smaller set of galaxies is required
and in models where galaxies cycle less frequently a much larger set of galaxies is required
to maintain this population of very blue galaxies We assumed a Salpeter 1955 IMF with
upper and lower mass limits of 01M and 125M respectively and aged the galaxies
using a relatively current 1995 version of the spectral evolution code of Bruzual  Charlot
1993 In accordance with the GK model we assume a SMC extinction law Bouchet et al
1985 and EB  V   01 for all but the two reddest morphological types and we assume
that H0  50 km s1Mpc1 throughout
GK do not specify the surface brightness properties of their sample and we adopt
values derived from local observations and the relation between star formation history
and morphological type We take the three reddest classes of objects in GKs model GK
classes 9-11 B  V  085 to represent elliptical galaxies with a de Vaucouleurs prole
with intrinsic half-life radii determined by Bingelli Sandage  Tarenghi 1984 We take
the next three reddest classes GK class 6-8 065  B  V  085 to represent Sa-Sc
galaxies with surface brightnesses given by Freemans law Freeman 1970 on which we
superimpose an exponential prole for the bulge with a total ux equal to one quarter that
of the disk and a scale length equal to 0082 that of the disk Courteau de Jong  Broeils
1996 We take the ve bluest classes to be irregularlate spiral galaxies GK class 1-5
B  V  065 with a surface brightness for the disk identical to that for the Sa-Sc galaxies
Since GK do not specify a distinct star formation for simplicity we assume the same star
formation history for the bulges and the disks We mimic seeing and other smearing eects
by convolving the angular proles of each simulated galactic image with a Gaussian point
spread function We consider the disk galaxies to be oriented at an ensemble of incident
angles and we apply the selection criteria used in various determinations of the LF in a
way very similar to that outlined in Yoshii 1993
From these models we calculated the luminosity functions that would have been
determined by Loveday et al 1992 Marzke Huchra  Geller 1994 Lin et al 1996
and Mobasher et al 1993 from the APM CfA Las Campanas and Anglo-Australian
redshift surveys respectively Our calculations are shown in Figure 1 Because the selection
criteria for these surveys are often variable from eld to eld or even somewhat unclear
we consider the selection criteria we have employed to be average estimates of the true
 4 
selection criteria For the APM survey we selected galaxies with apparent magnitudes
between 15 and 1715 BJ mag and whose surface brightness is at least 245 BJ magarcsec2
over a region with a 115 arcsec radius Maddox et al 1990 For the CfA survey we
selected galaxies with apparent magnitudes brighter than 155 BJ mag and whose surface
brightness is at least 235 BJ magarcsec2 over a region with a 45 arcsec radius criteria
we consider only to be a reasonable estimate To mimic the scatter in the relationship
between Zwicky magnitudes and BJ mag we convolved the derived LF with a Gaussian
of standard deviation 035 mag Bothun  Cornell 1990 For the Las Campanas redshift
survey LCRS we used the 112-ber selection criteria given in Lin et al 1996 and took
their magnitudes to be isophotal down to a surface brightness of 23 Gunn r magarcsec2
For the Anglo-Australian Redshift Survey AARS we selected galaxies whose apparent
magnitude is less than 172 BJ mag and whose surface brightness is at least 235 BJ
magarcsec2
Using the 2 test and taking  equal to obsqNmodelNobs 1 we compared the
LFs predicted for various interpretations of the GK model to the actual determinations
Formally the calculated LF for the GK model to within 03 magnitude of an observation
and our models are inconsistent with the LF of Mobasher et al 1993 Lin et al 1996
Loveday et al 1992 and Marzke et al 1994 to 8  31  4  and 5  respectively
Since these discrepancies are arguably a result of uncertainties in both the calibrations
of the observed apparent magnitudes and the normalization due to the limited volumes
surveyed we will base our comparisons on those normalizations only for CfA and AARS
and calibrations which produced the best ts to the calculated LFs For these best-t
parameters the LFs of our models are still generally inconsistent with the measured LF
the LF from the LCRS is inconsistent to 19  a result essentially due to the fact that the
knees of the LFs are extremely well dened For the faint Mr  194 end of the LF
however we nd that only the LF from the LCRS is still inconsistent Our cycling models
are especially inconsistent Model A is inconsistent to 6  as they predict many more faint
galaxies than are observed Table 1
We show the redshift distributions we predict for the Canada-France-Hawaii Redshift
Survey Lilly et al 1995 CFHRS for both the GK model and our models in Figure
2 In accordance with the selection procedure we took the seeing FWHM to be 09
arcsec and have included those galaxies which had a central surface brightness of 2402 I
magarcsec2 We took their magnitudes to be isophotal down to a surface brightness of
2752 I magarcsec2 The predicted overabundance at low redshifts has two sources the
1Note that the observational mean is only an estimate of the true variance which is determined by the
 5 
very steep upturn at the faint end of the GK LFa feature inherent to the GK modeland
the additional populations of fading or cycling galaxies which are not forming stars Since
this rst source of low redshift galaxies predominates at z  005 while the second is more
uniformly spread over low redshifts we have decided to examine the relative number of
galaxies observed and predicted for the redshift bins 0  z  005 and 005  z  015
separately For the sake of comparison we assume the observed redshift distribution
though mildly incomplete is representative
The GK model predicts too many galaxies in the lowest redshift bin 35  but roughly
the right number in the other low redshift bin In contrast all our models predict too many
galaxies in this other low redshift bin 21-38  inconsistency We have summarized these
results in Table 1 along with the relative consistency levels of these models to the faint
end of the LCRS r-band LF In Table 1 we have also included the cumulative degree to
which the CFHRS and the faint end of the LCRS r-band LF rule out the various models
considered in this Letter Of course one should interpret these results with some caution
as our analysis makes the questionable assumption that the galaxies in the CFHRS are
unclustered
Ignoring surface brightness selection eects we have calculated number counts in the
BJ and K bands for the GK model and our models We display these calculations in
Figure 3 along with a comparison to a set of recent observations2 The GK model and our
interpretations of it agree reasonably well with the observations in the BJ band though
the predictions seem to be about 25 too high and low on a portion of the bright and
faint ends in the K band respectively Though some of this dierence can be attributed
to the use of dierent versions of the Bruzual  Charlot spectral evolution code much of
this dierence simply results from the mildly imperfect t to the number counts used in
producing the GK model
To determine the sensitivity of the present results to the surface brightness properties
of these non-physical blue galaxies we repeated our calculations assuming a surface
brightness lower than Freemans law by 15 magarcsec2 In accordance with expectations
we calculated that fewer fading galaxies and fewer cycling galaxies would be observed in
both the LFs considered and the CFHRS For these lower surface brightness galaxies we
nd that both the GK model and our models can be made consistent with the faint end
of the LFs considered Nevertheless the GK model and our models are still inconsistent
2Note that for the purposes of this gure the error bars on the number counts from Metcalfe et al 1991
and Metcalfe et al 1995 are equal to the sum in quadrature of half the estimated completeness correction
and the Poissonian error times one and a half
 6 
with the number of galaxies at low redshift to 32  and 41  respectively Therefore
while lowering the surface brightness of the non-physical blue galaxies in the GK model
permits a reconciliation with the faint end of the Las Campanas LF it does not permit a
reconciliation with the lack of low redshift galaxies in the CFHRS Of course one could
always suppose these non-physical blue galaxies have even lower surface brightnesses than
we have considered ie greater than 231 BJ magarcsec2 but at some point this lower
surface brightness would remove these galaxies from other observations as well such as the
color distributions these non-physical blue galaxies were originally employed to explain
In fact the observed properties of the galaxies responsible for the deep counts excess
only require a steepening of the low luminosity end of the LF in the distant universe
z  05 Treyer  Silk 1994 Fading by expansion due perhaps to a very substantial wind
that drives mass loss might be invoked to reconcile the high redshift data with the local
observations but we have not explored this possibility cf Babul  Rees 1992
3 Conclusions
In this Letter we have proposed various physical interpretations of the non-physical
population of blue galaxies in the GK model and have calculated how these interpretations
would be manifested in various determinations of the redshift distribution the luminosity
function and the number counts Firstly we nd that the GK model and all our models
predict too many galaxies at low redshift 0  z  005 in the CFHRSan excess which
is intrinsic to the GK model itself Glazebrook et al 1995 previously reported this low
redshift excess with regard to a similar model Koo Gronwall  Bruzual 1993 For
our models we predict an additional low redshift population which exceeds the observed
galaxies in CFHRS in the redshift range 005  z  015 Secondly for our cycling
models we predict that too many intrinsically faint galaxies would be observed in the
LCRS LF If one supposes this bluest class of galaxies has lower surface brightnesses ie
231 BJ magarcsec2 we no longer nd an excess of galaxies at the faint end of the LCRS
LF Nevertheless there is still a discrepancy between the number of galaxies observed in
the lowest redshift bins 0  z  015 and the number predicted from the GK model and
our models respectively Hence passive evolution using normal galaxies essentially in
the spirit of the GK model and the modications that we have advocated fails to account
both for the deep counts and for the low redshift counterparts of the distant galaxies One
needs to add either luminosity evolution in the form for example of dynamical fading or a
top heavy IMF or number evolution as occurs in merging histories or some combination
of these eects
 7 
Recently in a model which is somewhat similar to the GK model Pozzetti Bruzual
 Zamorani 1996 have presented an alternate set of models which propose to explain
much of the current observational data number counts redshift distributions and color
distributions with essentially passive evolution One of the most notable improvements
of this new model over the GK model is the relative absence of galaxies at low redshifts
z  005 Despite this improvement this new model invokes a population of eternally
young 01 Gyr galaxies quite similar to those galaxies used in the GK model Making
these galaxies physical in the ways outlined here would have similar observational eects to
those we have calculated though our own calculations have shown that the corresponding
low redshift eects are not large enough to cause a problem with the observations employed
in this paper The basic reason for this dierence is that the non-physical blue galaxies in
this model make up a much smaller fraction of the galaxies seen at any apparent magnitude
than the non-physical blue galaxies do in the GK model Nevertheless for the case that
galaxies have normal surface brightnesses this model still predicts a 200 excess in the
number of galaxies found at the faint Mr  186 end of LF derived from the LCRS
As a nal note while we have examined how both the GK model and our physical
interpretations would manifest themselves in various determinations of the redshift
distribution number counts and luminosity function at zero redshift we suspect that it
may also be fruitful to consider other constraints on passive evolution models from various
recent studies that have shown albeit with sparser data that the luminosity function
steepens Ellis et al 1996 or brightens Lilly et al 1995 as one progresses back in redshift
