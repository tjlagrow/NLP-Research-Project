Abstract
Natural Language whether spoken and attended
to by humans or processed and generated by com-
puters requires a series of structures and networks
that reect creative processes in semantic syntac-
tic phonetic linguistic social emotional and cul-
tural modules Being able to produce novel and
useful behavior following repeated practice gets to
the root of both articial intelligence and human
language This paper investigates current modal-
ities involved in language-like applications that
computers  and programmers  are engaged with
and seeks ways of ne tuning the questions we ask
to better account for context self-awareness and
embodiment
1 Introduction
In the genesis of intelligent computational systems one
often observes programs that write before they can read
compose before they can listen and paint before they can
see However the most successful systems in poetry mu-
sic and visual art are indeed perceptually aware  and de-
rive signicant benets from that ability Kurzweil 1990
Screene and Wiggins 2015 Colton et al 2015b
We will argue that the bar by which we judge computa-
tional creativity in text generation  and appreciation  can
and must be raised in order to build systems that we can
meaningfully communicate with Our paper takes the form
of a necessarily high-level sketch supported by hand-crafted
examples that draw on both standard and custom software
Most of these examples concern computer poetry but our aim
is not to present a technical or aesthetic achievement Rather
we use the examples to survey the limitations of current sys-
tems and to indicate some potentially novel approaches
Specically we highlight three interrelated thematic areas
that we think will repay effort
Contextual understanding
Ie responding meaningfully
to some meaningful circumstance even if it is just a one-line
writing prompt rather than babbling The paper includes an
example of a computer-generated poem that is essentially just
verbose babbling tted to a predened template This poem
was previously reviewed by a published poet and it doesnt
stand up well to critical scrutiny Corneli et al 2015 The
poem misses a sense of why  and the program that gener-
ated this poem would not be able to offer what the Provenal
poets called the razo Agamben 1995 p 51 that is an ex-
position of the poem
Self-awareness Here the ablility to reason about creativ-
ity as a process The computer currently has available lim-
ited metadata about its available processes and the potential
to reason about this abstractly But the software tools we
are examining cannot as yet make sense of simple writing
prompts nor reason about how revise a process of response
into a more suitable process nor respond to feedback to pro-
duce a better poem In the future the computer might know
something about all of these things  and it could also know
when its knowledge is uncertain and proceed accordingly
 perhaps by asking for help or by making two different gen-
erative attempts in parallel and assessing which one works
better relative to its contextual understanding
consider
Simulated embodiment We will
program
owcharts Charnley et al 2014 as the primary framework
with which to describe the computers process layer
Flowcharts resemble a factory or workshop more than
they resemble the kinds of bodies that humans are used to
inhabiting Nevertheless a workshop-like workow lends
a kind of simulated physicality to the creative process
and suggests a somewhat different way of thinking than
the more linguistic thought associated with the underlying
computer code For instance if the computer is revising a
owchart or poem it would be able to move things around
or see where something ts Perhaps most importantly the
processes available to the system can start to be thought of as
a collection of gestures and a poem can be read or written
in respect to its gestural content The denition of gesture
due to Twelfth Century theologist Hugues de Saint-Victor
quoted in Mazzola 2016 shows the connection with our
other themes
Gesture is the movement and guration of the
bodys limbs with an aim but also according to the
measure and modality proper to the achievement of
all action and attitude
After exploring these themes from a computing standpoint
we turn to a discussion that evaluates the technical sketching
from the point of view of the second author an English as
a Foreign Language teacher with a prior background in con-
sciousness studies Finally we draw on this discussion to
outline a plan for future computational experiments centered
on the idea of making sense of language
2 Motivation
Oscar Schwartz offers the following framing
Can a computer write poetry This is a provoca-
tive question You think about it for a minute and
you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like
What is a computer What is poetry What is cre-
ativity Schwartz 2015
Computer poetry may sound like a bit of a lark  after all
its not clear that anyone really needs it Nevertheless ask-
ing these questions about poetry begins to suggest a way of
working with language that has wider implications
Consider Turings idea that machines would be able to
converse with each other to sharpen their wits Turing
1951 This could be realized as a QA site specically for
computers The topics discussed could address all manner
of practical concerns for example those arising for bots that
are engaged in code or editorial review tasks
If the com-
puters had sufcient abilities with natural language this sys-
tem could be bridged into a QA site that is in everyday use
by human beings However before a computational system
would be useful in a QA context it would need to be able to
understand the questions that are being asked to a reasonable
degree and also to be able to compose meaningful responses
So how would meaningful responses occur A high-level
outline could be something like this Corneli et al 2015
1 Read and understand the prompt to a sufcient degree
2 Compose a response that makes sense 3 Criticize the
response along various dimensions for instance does it read
well does it tell a story or develop a character 4 Consider
how it might be improved This outline is based on an estab-
lished process that groups of creative writers use to critique
and revise poetry or literary works for publication
When we turn to computer generated text  say poetry to
be concrete  in addition to examining the generated poem a
sophisticated audience can also examine the process whereby
the poem was generated and read the product against this
process or vice versa Indeed the computer can create both
poem and process the later via automatic programming  and
offer its own assessments of both as well as long as it can
make sense of the success criteria
21 Related work
Natural language processing often begins with a grammar If
none is available it may be induced for instance by using
compression techniques Wolff 1988 Both in older Red-
ington and Chater 1997 and quite recent work Hermann
et al 2015 statistical and neural network approaches to
corpus-based language understanding have shown strong po-
tential for developing reasoned ways of thinking about lin-
guistic structure without the usual grammatical assumptions
Corpus methods help to understand the patterns in the way
people use language and the creative potential of unexpected
word combinations Hoey 2005 One example cited by
Hoey is Tennysons famous line Theirs is not to reason why
Here the word reason is used with its verb sense rather than
with the noun sense that most readers would expect based
on their prior experience with the two-word phrase reason
why This unique feature makes the line memorable and in-
teresting The psycholinguistic properties of the broader phe-
nomenon of lexical priming have been extensively studied
Pace-Sigge 2013
The ascendant status of neural networks and data-driven
methods in natural language processing does not obviate sym-
bolic AI which continues to be useful for work with spe-
cialist languages For computer programming languages in
particular techniques for reection and in the case of LISP
homoiconicity ie treating code as data make it possible
to write computer programs that reason about and write or
rewrite computer programs Articial languages have been
used in video games in creative ways however as of the time
of this writing it does not seem that any of these languages
are used for functional communication with or between non-
player characters Multi-agent systems have however been
used in poetry generation One example system creates po-
ems based on repeated words and sounds driven by a model of
agents emotional states Kirke and Miranda 2013 inspired
by earlier work in music Kirke 2011 As for computer pro-
grams that read poetry this currently seems limited to reading
and mimicking surface style without extending to meaning
Carslisle 2000  even if some readers were fooled With-
out knowing whats in a poem it seems difcult to be other
than supercial The various challenges posed by computer
poetry serve as point of departure Of particular interest is the
following point Poetry exercises are used to allow learners
to explore the complexities of English Parker 2010
3 Exploration
Table 1 contains 10 short writing prompts excerpted from the
book 642 Things to Write About San Francisco Writers
Grotto 2012
In order to create a computer-generated re-
sponse to any of these prompts in addition to the prompt it-
self some suitable understanding of its meaning is required
The response itself will have various standard features Many
of the following features of stories are found with minor
adaptations in poetry and other kinds of writing
A story is not a modular presentation of ideas but
a multi-layered work consisting of interdependent
characters plot elements and settings Kim et al
Let us consider then a simple theory of stories and sto-
rytelling using these prompts This might involve a micro-
world containing A Scenario A Narrator An Audience A
Beginning A Middle and An End Consider that  with re-
spect to the Thanksgiving dish prompt  the computer has
presumably never tasted food of any kind It could however
imagine a scenario in which there is a character who eats a
Thanksgiving dish
1 What can happen in a second
2 The worst Thanksgiving dish you ever had
3 A houseplant is dying Tell it why it needs to live
4 Tell a story that begins with a ransom note
5 Write a recipe for disaster
6 If you had one week to live   
7 What your desk thinks about at night
8 The one thing you are most ashamed of  
9 Describe your best friend
10 Describe Heaven
Table 1 10 short writing prompts
31 An example Scenario
The scenario could be represented with various relations
Squanto memberOf Patuxet tribe Patuxet tribe
hasCardinality 1 Thanksgiving isa event
Thanksgiving hasHost Pilgrims Thanksgiving
hasGuest Squanto Thanksgiving hasFood eel
eel hasCondition burnt
Naturally this might be extended with further information
as that comes to light and in practice we might use a more
robust formalism
32 The other components
The Narrator would walk through the scenario and say whats
there On a metaphorical level the narrators role is some-
what similar to the way a virtual camera moves through a 3D
simulation in order to create a lm However the Narrator
needs to consider the Audience in order to be effective As
indicated in the quote from Kim et al above the data in the
Scenario needs to be structured when telling the story
Here is one possible presentation of the scenario embel-
lished with some facts ctions and local color and combined
into several sentences that ow reasonably well
Squanto was the last surviving member of the
Patuxet tribe He attended the rst Thanksgiving
with the Pilgrims wearing a new buckskin jacket
One of the foods that was served was eel but it had
been rather badly burnt and Squanto didnt nd it
to his liking
This text manages to include a range of emotionally evoca-
thought provoking character establishing and sen-
sory language last surviving member rst Thanksgiving
new buckskin jacket rather badly burnt didnt nd it to
his liking  and at least one unexpected word combination
Thanksgiving   eel It also has a discernible Beginning
Middle and End It seems appropriate to call it a story
33 How to come up with stories
Lets start with a parse
NP DT The JJS worst
NNP Thanksgiving NN dish
SBAR S NP PRP you ADVP RB ever
VP VBD had  
Here are some associated word meanings from WordNet1

a particular item of prepared
pronoun

serve oneself to or consume
regularly
There are some other interesting word senses available and
knowing which one to pick or how and how much to com-
bine various senses seems like a bit of an art form Should we
consider a short prayer of thanks before a meal when thinking
of Thanksgiving For now we will say a short prayer and
tentatively assume that a NN dish is what you eat rather
than what you eat off of Lexical priming Hoey 2005
techniques would help make the relevant distinction here
But supposing we get this far now what Weve moved
from one sentence to several quasi-sentences without get-
ting that much closer to a Scenario like the one envisaged
above One possibility is that the WordNet expansion could
be sufcient give us relevant keywords and phrases from
which a small corpus could be built eg by doing a web
search for the glosses and then mined to learn relations be-
tween the items in that corpus Mining signicant associa-
tions from large scale text corpora is something people have
explored in various ways Finding subject-verb-object triples
in particular is a popular method one well-known algorithm
is presented by Rusu et al 2007 This is sometimes called
building a semantic model The basic theme goes back to
Quillian 1969  about whom there will be more to say later
For now we just remark that in addition to expanding the
writing prompt we may also want to draw on some stock
associations stored in a background knowledge base We il-
lustrate the method from Rusu et al by applying it to the be-
ginning of the novel Frankenstein Table 2
You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has ac-
companied the commencement of an enterprise

ings    Shelley 1831 emphasis added

1NB WordNet does not contain entries for determiners or pro-
As far as text understanding goes the result in Table 2 is
not particularly encouraging However even a low-delity
database of background knowledge would allow us to extend
the story Perhaps Squanto would decide that the burnt eel
gives a foretaste of things to come To make this associa-
tion we might use methods similar to the ones used to rea-
son about ConceptNet triples  which have been employed to
good effect in text and concept generation within the FloWr
framework Llano et al 2016 which is described below
34 Can FloWr owcharts be used to solve the
composition problem
FloWr Charnley et al 2014 is a owcharting system with
basic text processing abilities Metadata describing the Pro-
cessNodes from which FloWrs owcharts are formed can
be used to pose and solve simple automatic programming
problems A writing prompt like worst Thanksgiving dish
can be interpreted as a constraint  or more broadly a t-
ness function  that steers the generative process and trickles
through to guide the choice of functional components and
eventually words By tness function we understand that
text may be composed iteratively and improved along the
way relative to some context of evaluation The simple ex-
amples in Figure 1 illustrate problems that can be solved quite
straightforwardly
Give me a list of mixed adjectives and nouns
the italicized terms are independent variables that tell the
WordSenseCategoriser node how to behave or
Give me a list of rhyming couplets built of text
drawn from The Guardian and Twitter
It may make sense to include considerably more abstrac-
tion in the description of larger and more complex owcharts
For example a owchart discussed in Corneli et al 2015 in-
cludes 28 nodes and generates the following poem and others
that are similar
Oh dog the mysterious demon
Why do you feel startle of attention
Oh demon the lonely encounter
ghostly elusive ruler
Oh encounter the horrible glimpse
helpless introspective consciousness
Would the most succinct description of the owchart be
an approximately 28 clause sentence that is equivalent to the
owchart Perhaps in the current case everything can be
compressed down to the following template which is xed
for this particular owchart
Oh THEME the COLLOCATE SIMILAR
Why do you feel INVERSION of DESIRED
Oh SIMILAR the COLLOCATE-OF-SIMILAR SIMILAR-
SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATEcid48
TO-SIMILAR
COLLOCATE-OF-SIMILAR
SIMILAR-TO-SIMILARcid48
the COLLOCATE-OF-
SIMILAR-TO-SIMILAR SIMILAR-TO-SIMILAR-TO-
SIMILAR
SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE
COLLOCATE-OF-COLLOCATE
The connection between this template its instantiation and
the putative prompt Write a poem about an old dog who is
afraid of attention is tenuous at best Nevertheless reason-
able hope exists for future work that would generate models
 and a Narrator process  tailor-made to a given prompt
FloWrs ProcessNodes dene a micro-language denoting
the available ways in which the system can transform input
data to output data Table 3 In a meaningful expansion of a
given prompt many choices would have to be made and ide-
ally justied in a self-aware explicable manner  using a
generate and test methodology as needed New owcharts
built in response to writing prompts or other contextual data
would constitute the systems core learnings In short po-
etry and process need to be thought about together
4 Discussion
In this section we will briey review human language learn-
ing from a second language teaching perspective and then
draw comparisons with the foregoing description of a hypo-
thetical computer language learner
First why are primary language learning and second
foreign language learning often considered separately One
of the biggest differences between the two cases is that af-
ter learning a rst language neural pathways have been set
down so that second language information has to be encoded
along with or beside the rst language pathways New
neural connections have to be formed to maintain the mem-
ory of the second language whereas the rst language has
been implanted quite thoroughly So when learning verbs
nouns etc the person child adult learns or has learned for
instance stand up rst and then that levantate means a
similar thing in Spanish or that chair  silla As they
progress in the second language what we nd is a process
that linguists call interlanguage Selinker 1972 or a lan-
guage that is not quite English and not totally Spanish yet
because of the variations in the two languages in structure
phonemes morphemes allophones semantics and so on
Language is also very multi-modal and if we think again
in terms of neurons and brain pathways the word dog not
only brings up images of a furry canine animal but all kinds
of other associations Pet dogs Large and small dogs Dogs
with different color fur visual cortex Dog as a verb mo-
tor cortex associations The smell of wet dogs olfactory
bulb Fear of dogs limbic system Favorite pet dogs you
have loved in your life emotions The spelling or sound
of the word D-O-G as opposed to D-A-W-G auditory and
visual cortex
If you are from certain countries perhaps
even dog meat Imagining a demon dog will invoke net-
works running all over the brain Schlegel et al 2013 Now
what about computers do they have a similar symbolic or
multi-modal operating ability People as they become lit-
erate learn to write and sound out letters at the same time
 and the foundations of rst language learning draw heav-
ily on a sensory-motor channel Iverson and Thelen 1999
Hernandez 2013
Computers may be said to have a rst language with sev-
eral dialects highly constrained by grammar  namely byte-
code and programming languages The owcharts described

Table 3 Triples describe the functional mapping from input to output for selected FloWr nodes
above begin to recover a degree of multi-modality and a pro-
cess orientation that is similar in certain partial respects to
sensory-motor experience In the Introduction we described
nodes and owcharts using a workshop metaphor We may
also think of them as somewhat akin to neurons and cortexes
as above After all there is a kind of embodiment even in the
brain  it is an active and evolving organ Flowcharts are quite
different from classical neural network models but one com-
mon feature is that they would need to be grown and trained
in order to understand and express language
Again the theme of poetry suggests a route forward Ex-
ercises from a book like Writing Simple Poems Pattern Po-
etry for Language Acquisition Holmes and Moulton 2001
might be used to teach computers as well as humans Note
that grammar and poetry are very different and perhaps com-
plementary Thus for example a Learn English notebook
found in Japan with Subject  Verb  Direct Object  Indirect
Object  Prepositional Phrase  Adjectival Phrase written
at the top of each page offers a useful rubric for Japanese
students since the verb comes at the end of the sentence
in Japanese SOV But grammar will only get you so far
Consider Chomskys famous nonsense statement Colorless
green ideas sleep furiously A poetic gesture  like prex-
ing that phrase with a description of planted tulip bulbs  is
able to make some sense out of nonsense by adding context2
5 Future work
Quillians The Teachable Language Comprehender A Sim-
ulation Program and Theory of Language 1969 took the
novel  and fundamental  approach of understanding things
in such a way that new understandings could be added di-
rectly to its knowledge base3 When reading a piece of text
2httpwwwlinguistlistorgissues22-
457html2
3In practice While the monitor can add TLCs encoded output
to the programs memory the program itself makes no attempt to do
the TLC program would search its memory for related infor-
mation that it could use to make sense of the input More
specically a given text would be expanded using form
tests which extracted meaningful pieces of the text and con-
nected these to items stored in memory Quillian writes that
ultimately a human-like memory should relate descriptive
knowledge of the world to perceptual-motor activity in a
manner like that indicated by Piaget  but deems this to be
far beyond our present scope Quillian 1969 p 474
Future research might use FloWr to develop a TLC-like li-
brary of form tests and generative tools that would add a
multi-modal aspect to knowledge representation To be sure
a owchart-based representation of poetic process would be
quite different from the embodied sensory-motor experience
of humans Nevertheless computational processes that allow
us to model text generation contextually procedurally and
gesturally can help to understand the way linguistic meaning
comes to be This is not something we can readily learn from
parsing corpus-based modeling or grammar-based text gen-
eration alone
There is exciting potential for future experiments with nat-
ural language that strives to capture and express shades of
meaning and the feel of the language Experimentation is
necessary if we have learned anything about language it is
that learners should be motivated to speak bravely Wang

1 Introduction
In the genesis of intelligent computational systems one
often observes programs that write before they can read
compose before they can listen and paint before they can
see However the most successful systems in poetry mu-
sic and visual art are indeed perceptually aware  and de-
rive signicant benets from that ability Kurzweil 1990
Screene and Wiggins 2015 Colton et al 2015b
We will argue that the bar by which we judge computa-
tional creativity in text generation  and appreciation  can
and must be raised in order to build systems that we can
meaningfully communicate with Our paper takes the form
of a necessarily high-level sketch supported by hand-crafted
examples that draw on both standard and custom software
Most of these examples concern computer poetry but our aim
is not to present a technical or aesthetic achievement Rather
we use the examples to survey the limitations of current sys-
tems and to indicate some potentially novel approaches
Specically we highlight three interrelated thematic areas
that we think will repay effort
Contextual understanding
Ie responding meaningfully
to some meaningful circumstance even if it is just a one-line
writing prompt rather than babbling The paper includes an
example of a computer-generated poem that is essentially just
verbose babbling tted to a predened template This poem
was previously reviewed by a published poet and it doesnt
stand up well to critical scrutiny Corneli et al 2015 The
poem misses a sense of why  and the program that gener-
ated this poem would not be able to offer what the Provenal
poets called the razo Agamben 1995 p 51 that is an ex-
position of the poem
Self-awareness Here the ablility to reason about creativ-
ity as a process The computer currently has available lim-
ited metadata about its available processes and the potential
to reason about this abstractly But the software tools we
are examining cannot as yet make sense of simple writing
prompts nor reason about how revise a process of response
into a more suitable process nor respond to feedback to pro-
duce a better poem In the future the computer might know
something about all of these things  and it could also know
when its knowledge is uncertain and proceed accordingly
 perhaps by asking for help or by making two different gen-
erative attempts in parallel and assessing which one works
better relative to its contextual understanding
consider
Simulated embodiment We will
program
owcharts Charnley et al 2014 as the primary framework
with which to describe the computers process layer
Flowcharts resemble a factory or workshop more than
they resemble the kinds of bodies that humans are used to
inhabiting Nevertheless a workshop-like workow lends
a kind of simulated physicality to the creative process
and suggests a somewhat different way of thinking than
the more linguistic thought associated with the underlying
computer code For instance if the computer is revising a
owchart or poem it would be able to move things around
or see where something ts Perhaps most importantly the
processes available to the system can start to be thought of as
a collection of gestures and a poem can be read or written
in respect to its gestural content The denition of gesture
due to Twelfth Century theologist Hugues de Saint-Victor
quoted in Mazzola 2016 shows the connection with our
other themes
Gesture is the movement and guration of the
bodys limbs with an aim but also according to the
measure and modality proper to the achievement of
all action and attitude
After exploring these themes from a computing standpoint
we turn to a discussion that evaluates the technical sketching
from the point of view of the second author an English as
a Foreign Language teacher with a prior background in con-
sciousness studies Finally we draw on this discussion to
outline a plan for future computational experiments centered
on the idea of making sense of language
2 Motivation
Oscar Schwartz offers the following framing
Can a computer write poetry This is a provoca-
tive question You think about it for a minute and
you suddenly have a bunch of other questions like
What is a computer What is poetry What is cre-
ativity Schwartz 2015
Computer poetry may sound like a bit of a lark  after all
its not clear that anyone really needs it Nevertheless ask-
ing these questions about poetry begins to suggest a way of
working with language that has wider implications
Consider Turings idea that machines would be able to
converse with each other to sharpen their wits Turing
1951 This could be realized as a QA site specically for
computers The topics discussed could address all manner
of practical concerns for example those arising for bots that
are engaged in code or editorial review tasks
If the com-
puters had sufcient abilities with natural language this sys-
tem could be bridged into a QA site that is in everyday use
by human beings However before a computational system
would be useful in a QA context it would need to be able to
understand the questions that are being asked to a reasonable
degree and also to be able to compose meaningful responses
So how would meaningful responses occur A high-level
outline could be something like this Corneli et al 2015
1 Read and understand the prompt to a sufcient degree
2 Compose a response that makes sense 3 Criticize the
response along various dimensions for instance does it read
well does it tell a story or develop a character 4 Consider
how it might be improved This outline is based on an estab-
lished process that groups of creative writers use to critique
and revise poetry or literary works for publication
When we turn to computer generated text  say poetry to
be concrete  in addition to examining the generated poem a
sophisticated audience can also examine the process whereby
the poem was generated and read the product against this
process or vice versa Indeed the computer can create both
poem and process the later via automatic programming  and
offer its own assessments of both as well as long as it can
make sense of the success criteria
21 Related work
Natural language processing often begins with a grammar If
none is available it may be induced for instance by using
compression techniques Wolff 1988 Both in older Red-
ington and Chater 1997 and quite recent work Hermann
et al 2015 statistical and neural network approaches to
corpus-based language understanding have shown strong po-
tential for developing reasoned ways of thinking about lin-
guistic structure without the usual grammatical assumptions
Corpus methods help to understand the patterns in the way
people use language and the creative potential of unexpected
word combinations Hoey 2005 One example cited by
Hoey is Tennysons famous line Theirs is not to reason why
Here the word reason is used with its verb sense rather than
with the noun sense that most readers would expect based
on their prior experience with the two-word phrase reason
why This unique feature makes the line memorable and in-
teresting The psycholinguistic properties of the broader phe-
nomenon of lexical priming have been extensively studied
Pace-Sigge 2013
The ascendant status of neural networks and data-driven
methods in natural language processing does not obviate sym-
bolic AI which continues to be useful for work with spe-
cialist languages For computer programming languages in
particular techniques for reection and in the case of LISP
homoiconicity ie treating code as data make it possible
to write computer programs that reason about and write or
rewrite computer programs Articial languages have been
used in video games in creative ways however as of the time
of this writing it does not seem that any of these languages
are used for functional communication with or between non-
player characters Multi-agent systems have however been
used in poetry generation One example system creates po-
ems based on repeated words and sounds driven by a model of
agents emotional states Kirke and Miranda 2013 inspired
by earlier work in music Kirke 2011 As for computer pro-
grams that read poetry this currently seems limited to reading
and mimicking surface style without extending to meaning
Carslisle 2000  even if some readers were fooled With-
out knowing whats in a poem it seems difcult to be other
than supercial The various challenges posed by computer
poetry serve as point of departure Of particular interest is the
following point Poetry exercises are used to allow learners
to explore the complexities of English Parker 2010
3 Exploration
Table 1 contains 10 short writing prompts excerpted from the
book 642 Things to Write About San Francisco Writers
Grotto 2012
In order to create a computer-generated re-
sponse to any of these prompts in addition to the prompt it-
self some suitable understanding of its meaning is required
The response itself will have various standard features Many
of the following features of stories are found with minor
adaptations in poetry and other kinds of writing
A story is not a modular presentation of ideas but
a multi-layered work consisting of interdependent
characters plot elements and settings Kim et al
Let us consider then a simple theory of stories and sto-
rytelling using these prompts This might involve a micro-
world containing A Scenario A Narrator An Audience A
Beginning A Middle and An End Consider that  with re-
spect to the Thanksgiving dish prompt  the computer has
presumably never tasted food of any kind It could however
imagine a scenario in which there is a character who eats a
Thanksgiving dish
1 What can happen in a second
2 The worst Thanksgiving dish you ever had
3 A houseplant is dying Tell it why it needs to live
4 Tell a story that begins with a ransom note
5 Write a recipe for disaster
6 If you had one week to live   
7 What your desk thinks about at night
8 The one thing you are most ashamed of  
9 Describe your best friend
10 Describe Heaven
Table 1 10 short writing prompts
31 An example Scenario
The scenario could be represented with various relations
Squanto memberOf Patuxet tribe Patuxet tribe
hasCardinality 1 Thanksgiving isa event
Thanksgiving hasHost Pilgrims Thanksgiving
hasGuest Squanto Thanksgiving hasFood eel
eel hasCondition burnt
Naturally this might be extended with further information
as that comes to light and in practice we might use a more
robust formalism
32 The other components
The Narrator would walk through the scenario and say whats
there On a metaphorical level the narrators role is some-
what similar to the way a virtual camera moves through a 3D
simulation in order to create a lm However the Narrator
needs to consider the Audience in order to be effective As
indicated in the quote from Kim et al above the data in the
Scenario needs to be structured when telling the story
Here is one possible presentation of the scenario embel-
lished with some facts ctions and local color and combined
into several sentences that ow reasonably well
Squanto was the last surviving member of the
Patuxet tribe He attended the rst Thanksgiving
with the Pilgrims wearing a new buckskin jacket
One of the foods that was served was eel but it had
been rather badly burnt and Squanto didnt nd it
to his liking
This text manages to include a range of emotionally evoca-
thought provoking character establishing and sen-
sory language last surviving member rst Thanksgiving
new buckskin jacket rather badly burnt didnt nd it to
his liking  and at least one unexpected word combination
Thanksgiving   eel It also has a discernible Beginning
Middle and End It seems appropriate to call it a story
33 How to come up with stories
Lets start with a parse

NNP Thanksgiving NN dish
SBAR S NP PRP you ADVP RB ever

Here are some associated word meanings from WordNet1

regularly
There are some other interesting word senses available and
knowing which one to pick or how and how much to com-
bine various senses seems like a bit of an art form Should we
consider a short prayer of thanks before a meal when thinking
of Thanksgiving For now we will say a short prayer and
tentatively assume that a NN dish is what you eat rather
than what you eat off of Lexical priming Hoey 2005
techniques would help make the relevant distinction here
But supposing we get this far now what Weve moved
from one sentence to several quasi-sentences without get-
ting that much closer to a Scenario like the one envisaged
above One possibility is that the WordNet expansion could
be sufcient give us relevant keywords and phrases from
which a small corpus could be built eg by doing a web
search for the glosses and then mined to learn relations be-
tween the items in that corpus Mining signicant associa-
tions from large scale text corpora is something people have
explored in various ways Finding subject-verb-object triples
in particular is a popular method one well-known algorithm
is presented by Rusu et al 2007 This is sometimes called
building a semantic model The basic theme goes back to
Quillian 1969  about whom there will be more to say later
For now we just remark that in addition to expanding the
writing prompt we may also want to draw on some stock
associations stored in a background knowledge base We il-
lustrate the method from Rusu et al by applying it to the be-
ginning of the novel Frankenstein Table 2
You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has ac-
companied the commencement of an enterprise
which you have regarded with such evil forebod-
ings    Shelley 1831 emphasis added

1NB WordNet does not contain entries for determiners or pro-
As far as text understanding goes the result in Table 2 is
not particularly encouraging However even a low-delity
database of background knowledge would allow us to extend
the story Perhaps Squanto would decide that the burnt eel
gives a foretaste of things to come To make this associa-
tion we might use methods similar to the ones used to rea-
son about ConceptNet triples  which have been employed to
good effect in text and concept generation within the FloWr
framework Llano et al 2016 which is described below
34 Can FloWr owcharts be used to solve the
composition problem
FloWr Charnley et al 2014 is a owcharting system with
basic text processing abilities Metadata describing the Pro-
cessNodes from which FloWrs owcharts are formed can
be used to pose and solve simple automatic programming
problems A writing prompt like worst Thanksgiving dish
can be interpreted as a constraint  or more broadly a t-
ness function  that steers the generative process and trickles
through to guide the choice of functional components and
eventually words By tness function we understand that
text may be composed iteratively and improved along the
way relative to some context of evaluation The simple ex-
amples in Figure 1 illustrate problems that can be solved quite
straightforwardly
Give me a list of mixed adjectives and nouns
the italicized terms are independent variables that tell the
WordSenseCategoriser node how to behave or
Give me a list of rhyming couplets built of text
drawn from The Guardian and Twitter
It may make sense to include considerably more abstrac-
tion in the description of larger and more complex owcharts
For example a owchart discussed in Corneli et al 2015 in-
cludes 28 nodes and generates the following poem and others
that are similar
Oh dog the mysterious demon
Why do you feel startle of attention
Oh demon the lonely encounter
ghostly elusive ruler
Oh encounter the horrible glimpse
helpless introspective consciousness
Would the most succinct description of the owchart be
an approximately 28 clause sentence that is equivalent to the
owchart Perhaps in the current case everything can be
compressed down to the following template which is xed
for this particular owchart
Oh THEME the COLLOCATE SIMILAR
Why do you feel INVERSION of DESIRED
Oh SIMILAR the COLLOCATE-OF-SIMILAR SIMILAR-
SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATEcid48
TO-SIMILAR
COLLOCATE-OF-SIMILAR
SIMILAR-TO-SIMILARcid48
the COLLOCATE-OF-
SIMILAR-TO-SIMILAR SIMILAR-TO-SIMILAR-TO-
SIMILAR
SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE SIMILAR-TO-COLLOCATE
COLLOCATE-OF-COLLOCATE
The connection between this template its instantiation and
the putative prompt Write a poem about an old dog who is
afraid of attention is tenuous at best Nevertheless reason-
able hope exists for future work that would generate models
 and a Narrator process  tailor-made to a given prompt
FloWrs ProcessNodes dene a micro-language denoting
the available ways in which the system can transform input
data to output data Table 3 In a meaningful expansion of a
given prompt many choices would have to be made and ide-
ally justied in a self-aware explicable manner  using a
generate and test methodology as needed New owcharts
built in response to writing prompts or other contextual data
would constitute the systems core learnings In short po-
etry and process need to be thought about together
4 Discussion
In this section we will briey review human language learn-
ing from a second language teaching perspective and then
draw comparisons with the foregoing description of a hypo-
thetical computer language learner
First why are primary language learning and second
foreign language learning often considered separately One
of the biggest differences between the two cases is that af-
ter learning a rst language neural pathways have been set
down so that second language information has to be encoded
along with or beside the rst language pathways New
neural connections have to be formed to maintain the mem-
ory of the second language whereas the rst language has
been implanted quite thoroughly So when learning verbs
nouns etc the person child adult learns or has learned for
instance stand up rst and then that levantate means a
similar thing in Spanish or that chair  silla As they
progress in the second language what we nd is a process
that linguists call interlanguage Selinker 1972 or a lan-
guage that is not quite English and not totally Spanish yet
because of the variations in the two languages in structure
phonemes morphemes allophones semantics and so on
Language is also very multi-modal and if we think again
in terms of neurons and brain pathways the word dog not
only brings up images of a furry canine animal but all kinds
of other associations Pet dogs Large and small dogs Dogs
with different color fur visual cortex Dog as a verb mo-
tor cortex associations The smell of wet dogs olfactory
bulb Fear of dogs limbic system Favorite pet dogs you
have loved in your life emotions The spelling or sound
of the word D-O-G as opposed to D-A-W-G auditory and
visual cortex
If you are from certain countries perhaps
even dog meat Imagining a demon dog will invoke net-
works running all over the brain Schlegel et al 2013 Now
what about computers do they have a similar symbolic or
multi-modal operating ability People as they become lit-
erate learn to write and sound out letters at the same time
 and the foundations of rst language learning draw heav-
ily on a sensory-motor channel Iverson and Thelen 1999
Hernandez 2013
Computers may be said to have a rst language with sev-
eral dialects highly constrained by grammar  namely byte-
code and programming languages The owcharts described

Table 3 Triples describe the functional mapping from input to output for selected FloWr nodes
above begin to recover a degree of multi-modality and a pro-
cess orientation that is similar in certain partial respects to
sensory-motor experience In the Introduction we described
nodes and owcharts using a workshop metaphor We may
also think of them as somewhat akin to neurons and cortexes
as above After all there is a kind of embodiment even in the
brain  it is an active and evolving organ Flowcharts are quite
different from classical neural network models but one com-
mon feature is that they would need to be grown and trained
in order to understand and express language
Again the theme of poetry suggests a route forward Ex-
ercises from a book like Writing Simple Poems Pattern Po-
etry for Language Acquisition Holmes and Moulton 2001
might be used to teach computers as well as humans Note
that grammar and poetry are very different and perhaps com-
plementary Thus for example a Learn English notebook
found in Japan with Subject  Verb  Direct Object  Indirect
Object  Prepositional Phrase  Adjectival Phrase written
at the top of each page offers a useful rubric for Japanese
students since the verb comes at the end of the sentence
in Japanese SOV But grammar will only get you so far
Consider Chomskys famous nonsense statement Colorless
green ideas sleep furiously A poetic gesture  like prex-
ing that phrase with a description of planted tulip bulbs  is
able to make some sense out of nonsense by adding context2
5 Future work
Quillians The Teachable Language Comprehender A Sim-
ulation Program and Theory of Language 1969 took the
novel  and fundamental  approach of understanding things
in such a way that new understandings could be added di-
rectly to its knowledge base3 When reading a piece of text
2httpwwwlinguistlistorgissues22-
457html2
3In practice While the monitor can add TLCs encoded output
to the programs memory the program itself makes no attempt to do
the TLC program would search its memory for related infor-
mation that it could use to make sense of the input More
specically a given text would be expanded using form
tests which extracted meaningful pieces of the text and con-
nected these to items stored in memory Quillian writes that
ultimately a human-like memory should relate descriptive
knowledge of the world to perceptual-motor activity in a
manner like that indicated by Piaget  but deems this to be
far beyond our present scope Quillian 1969 p 474
Future research might use FloWr to develop a TLC-like li-
brary of form tests and generative tools that would add a
multi-modal aspect to knowledge representation To be sure
a owchart-based representation of poetic process would be
quite different from the embodied sensory-motor experience
of humans Nevertheless computational processes that allow
us to model text generation contextually procedurally and
gesturally can help to understand the way linguistic meaning
comes to be This is not something we can readily learn from
parsing corpus-based modeling or grammar-based text gen-
eration alone
There is exciting potential for future experiments with nat-
ural language that strives to capture and express shades of
meaning and the feel of the language Experimentation is
necessary if we have learned anything about language it is
that learners should be motivated to speak bravely Wang
