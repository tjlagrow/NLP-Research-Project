Abstract We study by computer simulation the Hawkes process that was
proposed in a recent paper by Crane and Sornette Proc Nat Acad Sci USA
105 15649 2008 as a plausible model for the dynamics of YouTube video viewing
numbers We test the claims made there that robust identication is possible for classes
of dynamic response following activity bursts Our simulated timeseries for the Hawkes
process indeed fall into the dierent categories predicted by Crane and Sornette
However the Hawkes process gives a much narrower spread of decay exponents than
the YouTube data suggesting limits to the universality of the Hawkes-based analysis

1 Introduction
Recently 1 Crane and Sornette analysed the viewing of YouTube videos as an example
of a nonlinear social system They identied peaks in the timeseries of viewing gures
for around half a million videos and studied the subsequent decay of the peak to a
background viewing level A self-excited Poisson process or Hawkes process 2 was
proposed as a model of the video-watching dynamics and a plausible link made to
the social interactions that create strong correlations between the viewing actions of
dierent people Individual viewing is not random but inuenced by various channels
of communication about what to watch next
The Hawkes process has a Poisson distributed number of views with an
instantaneous rate given by
t  t  X
it  ti
Here  is a noisy source term allowing viewing to occur even for a completely dormant
video for instance and the summation describes how past viewing events at times ti
inuence the current event rate The coecient i is the number of potential viewers
inuenced directly by person i who viewed a video at time ti the function  describes
the waiting time distribution for those inuenced between trigger and response Put
dierently this is the distribution of waiting times between nding out about a particular

video and actually viewing the video If t is a power-law memory function as used
in this work the resulting process is also known as an ETAS model 3 and can be used
to model earthquake aftershocks
On the basis of previous work 4 Crane and Sornette chose a long-memory waiting
time distribution
t  t1

For xed  we address variability in  later on the behaviour of a timeseries generated
by such a Hawkes process then depends on the distribution of  There are four separate
dynamical classes two if a viewing shock happens from an external stimulus two from
internal dynamics 5 In this paper we address only the dynamics of externally shocked
timeseries but for completeness all four dynamic classes will be outlined below
In each dynamic class there is a dierent prediction for the power-law decay of the
activity level following an initial shock The power laws involved are quite distinct for
each class and predicted by 5 to depend solely on  whereas the statistics of  control
solely which class one is in Therefore if Eq2 were really to hold with a unique  one
might naively expect the distribution of power law exponents observed in the data to
collapse onto a set of discrete delta-functions one for each dynamic class On reection
however this cannot be correct since an individual activity burst represents a sequence
of discrete events which unless the total number of these is enormously large is unlikely
to be fully self-averaging for the purposes of tting a power law to the long-time decay
In practice for the YouTube data 1 the distribution of tted exponents is very broad
with at best bump-like features at the expected discrete exponent values Crane and
Sornette get around this by using a quite separate method detailed below to classify
the dynamic class of each burst and then showing that the subdistributions for each
class are unimodal with modal values close to the expected one for that class The
overlapping exponent distributions that necessitate this procedure do however call into
question the announced robustness 1 of the dynamic classes inferred from the Hawkes
In the present work we perform simulations that shed light on how much of this
exponent variability can be expected to arise from the Hawkes process itself Any
variability beyond this level in the YouTube data is evidence that Eq2 does not really
describe the social dynamics of YouTube Of course nobody would expect this dynamics
to be captured exactly by the Hawkes process however behind the concept of robust
dynamic classes in 1 lies a broader notion of universality For instance in equilibrium
critical phenomena a very simple model the Ising model captures to arbitrary accuracy
the universal features of a wide class of phase transitions involving order parameters of
the same symmetry
In the wider context of nonequilibrium criticality the universal
status of simple models is much less well established and deserves detailed attention
Our simulation results suggest that this universality may be somewhat limited at least
if one is interested in the distribution of tted exponents for individual activity bursts
within each dynamic class
Hawkes process as a model of social interactions a view on video dynamics
In what follows we rst classify all four dynamic regimes before presenting the
analysis of our results
2 External shock
In this regime the viewing rate is rst dominated by the  term in Eq2 At some
time t0 the video gains widespread public attention It might be featured in a national
newspaper or on some high-trac website or it may relate to a famous person whose
death is suddenly announced This produces a spike in the viewing gures which then
decay away The form of the decay depends on the distribution of 
 If hi  1 a cascade of viewing events occurs and the timeseries decays from the
shock like  t1 This is termed a critical decay
 If hi  1 only rst generation viewing events are important ie those stimulated
by the external source and the timeseries decays like  t1 This is a subcritical
3 Internal shock
A particular series of viewing events can lead to an internally created maximum in the
timeseries above that expected for a Poisson noise process This internal shock has
a dierent decay exponent again from the externally induced peaks The two internal
dynamic classes are
 A simple noise process if hi  1 no coherent peak arises
 A peak grows and decays like  t12 this occurs if hi  1
4 Classication and exponent values
If this model is correct for the dynamics of video views it should be possible to identify
the dierent dynamic classes by nding peaks in the viewing timeseries and then tting
a power law to the subsequent decay These power laws should form a distribution
which arises as the merger of the various classes if the individual activity bursts can
separately be classied the subdistribution for each class can be extracted Crane and
Sornette perform such an analysis and by tting to the modal exponent for each class
infer a value for the exponent  in Eq2 of   04 We therefore create articial
timeseries with hi  04 for best comparison with their data With this choice we
expect to extract decay exponents recalling that we only study the externally shocked
case of
 sc  1    14 and
 c  1    06
Hawkes process as a model of social interactions a view on video dynamics
As mentioned previously the model might lead one to expect -function peaks in
a PDF of decay exponents corresponding to the various dynamic classes The data
presented in 1 show weak peaks at these values but with a signicant spread
particular some of extracted exponents would imply values of  that lie outside the
range 0    1 required by the model itself With the help of our simulation data we
can look at whether the spread arises through miscategorisation a poor tting method
uctuations in the tted exponents due to noise inherent in the Hawkes process itself
or failure of the Hawkes model to accurately describe the YouTube data
5 Generating the synthetic data
We carry out a discrete-time simulation of the PoissonHawkes process restricting
attention to activity bursts initiated by external shocks We generally take each initial
shock to comprise N0  5000 views We choose to generate a random number of views
from a Poisson distribution with given mean at each timestep and update the rate
accordingly afterward Eectively we treat the continuously varying t as a constant
generate a given number of events and then modify  according to Eq 1 We must
also choose what values  and  can take Additionally we need a normalisation for the
distribution of waiting times  Following 1 we take this distribution normalized to
unity so that all those inuenced to watch a video by a particular viewing event do
watch it eventually Remembering that the waiting time will be an integer due to our
simulation strategy we have
t 
t11  
with  the Riemann -function This ensures
t  1
Our algorithm for generating the synthetic data is therefore as follows
i Shock the system by creating N0  N0 initial viewing events
ii For each viewing event generate the number of subsequent viewers i by sampling
i1 i future viewing events Each
from P  At time t we therefore seed n  P
of these n future viewers has their own decay constant i drawn from P 
iii Generate a Poisson event rate t by summing over the past history according to
iv Use this rate to generate the number of viewing events Nt between time t and
t  t
v Increment t by t and repeat steps ii to v until the maximum specied time has
been reached
The model analysis in 1 assumes that all  values are equal It is however not
If those
clear that all interactions would involve exactly the same response kernel
Hawkes process as a model of social interactions a view on video dynamics
inuenced have a distribution of waiting habits this can safely be averaged unless there
is a correlation with the person exerting the inuence so that  varies between the
events i in Eq2 To allow for the latter possibility we carry out simulations not
only with a single   04 but with a random distribution of i to see if this modies
the results For the latter we choose  from a truncated Gaussian with mean 04 and
standard deviation 02 restricting the support to   0 1
Finally we need to choose the statistics of i We will see that the particular choice
of distribution does not make an appreciable dierence to the results for the externally
shocked system although as detailed above the value of hi is important Here we
present results where  is drawn from appropriately weighted -function distributions
as well as Poisson distributions
6 Fitting the data
We estimate decay exponents from the articially produced timeseries both via the
method described in 1 and using a maximum likelihood estimator The least squares
estimator used in 1 can give incorrect parameters 6 since some of the assumptions
behind it are violated for power law decays However
in our study we nd little
dierence between the maximum likelihood decay exponents and the least squares
exponents which is evidence that errors in the exponent estimation method used in
1 are not the main cause of the large spread of observed exponents
61 Maximum likelihood estimator
Each post-shock timeseries decay has two free parameters once the peak has been
identied the decay exponent  and the time at which the peak has decayed to the
background noise level tmax To construct the maximum likelihood estimator MLE
for  we assume the data to be independent identically distributed random variables
drawn from a discrete power law distribution P t  That is with a peak occurring
at t  0 we expect for t  1     tmax
P t  
Htmax 
Htmax
is a generalized harmonic number
For every possible tmax we nd the best t value of  for this distribution using
a maximum likelihood estimator For a timeseries At our dataset consists of Ati
observations at each time ti Each of these tis has an individual likelihood given by
P ti  We assume each observation of ti is independent and so the likelihood of the
dataset factorises into the product of the individual likelihoods
L  Y
P ti 
titmax
Hawkes process as a model of social interactions a view on video dynamics
To nd the best t value of  for a given dataset we maximise the likelihood with
respect to  In fact since the likelihood is such a small value we instead maximise
the logarithm of the likelihood but this gives the same result To nd the best value of
tmax we follow the method of 6 and choose that tmax which minimises the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov distance statistic That is for each value of tmax we nd the best t decay
exponent and calculate
D  max
Ex  Cx
where Ex is the empirical cumulative distribution function and Cx the best-t-
hypothesis cumulative distribution function We then pick tmax as that value which
minimises D Note that this tting method while nding the best t tells us nothing
about the quality of that t
62 Least squares estimator
We also calculate the decay exponents for the same timeseries using the method
described by Crane and Sornette 1 This uses a least squares regression on the dataset
to nd the decay exponent from the peak over a xed window size For each t they
look at the distribution of the relative residuals ie the dierence between the model
and the empirical data divided by the expected value at that point
If the relative
residuals are not distributed normally the t for that window size is rejected The best
t to the data is chosen to be the largest window size with normally distributed relative
residuals Following 1 we reject the t if the hypothesis of a normal distribution is
violated at the 1 level using a 2 test
63 Fitting to an ensemble average
The individual timeseries that we generate are subject to a reasonable amount of noise
giving a spread of best t decay exponents Given that we control the time and size of
the initial shock we can easily obtain better statistics for the dierent parameter choices
by considering ensemble averaged timeseries This allows us to observe the behaviour
of the decay for a longer time and get a better t for the decay exponents
The tting method in this case is as before we obtain the best t  value by
maximising the likelihood of the data The decay now occurs over the whole tail of the
timeseries and so we do not need to nd tmax we can set it manually as equal to the
largest time in our dataset We t both from the peak of the decay and the tail To
determine where the tail of the data starts we follow the same procedure as detailed
above for nding tmax only this time we apply it to nd tmin That is for each tmin
value we calculate D Eq 8 of the best t and subsequently choose as our lower cut-o
that tmin which minimises D We obtain errors on our estimates of  by noting that our
MLE is asymptotically optimal 7 for N observations the variance in the estimated
value is therefore given by the inverse of the observed Fisher information 8

which can easily be obtained numerically The MLE is asymptotically Gaussian with
mean  and variance given by Eq9 and so condence intervals are just the standard

7 Results
To begin we look at the behaviour of the ensembled-averaged timeseries As expected
we see a clear distinction between the subcritical decay where hi  1 and the critical
decay with hi  1 The best t decay exponents are also those expected gure 1
The dierence between critical and subcritical decays remains when we draw  from a

well with the predicted values
Notice how the subcritical decay appears to exhibit a crossover between a short
time critical decay exponent and long time subcritical decay Increasing hi towards
the critical value of unity moves the crossover to later and later times Interestingly
when  is drawn from a Gaussian distribution both the critical and subcritical decays
exhibit some sort of crossover behaviour not seen in the critical decay for single-valued
 This crossover can contribute to the spread of exponents in the subcritical case since

the tting mechanism may pick up the early time decay The crossover observed is
discussed in detail in the context of the ETAS model in 3 9
We now look at the distribution of decay exponents of individual timeseries obtained
from both the MLE and least squares estimator Our results for the ensembled averaged
timeseries indicate that we will likely not see the asymptotic exponent in the subcritical
case if we t the entire post-shock timeseries tmin  0 as the decay exponent will be
skewed by the early time critical decay We therefore show results with tmin  0 10 20
and 30 these latter ts will give us an indication of what the tail exponent looks like
The results for a single value of  are shown in gure 3 those with  from a Gaussian
distribution are shown in gure 4
As expected tting the entire post-peak timeseries underestimates the subcritical
decay exponent Both tting methods pick up the early time decay which is slower once
the early time peak is ignored the decay exponents are more similar to the tail seen in the
ensemble-averaged case We note that the ts for tmin  1 do have quite a large spread
of exponents This is due to poor statistics in the tail of the decay the uctuations are
large enough that we occasionally pick up a highly anomalous decay exponent This
form of statistical noise appears to be intrinsic to the Hawkes process once the data is
ltered by tmin Improved ts and presumably also narrower distributions of the tted
exponents would arise if we used much larger initial shocks N0  5000
Our choice of N0 is however consistent with the statements in 1 of mean total
views in the tens of thousands with at least 20 of these viewed on the peak day
for the shocked case It is intended to give a realistic estimate of the intrinsic noise in

the Hawkes process to see if this can account for the large exponent spread actually
found in 1 Comparison of their gure 4 with our gures 3 and 4 shows such an
explanation to be implausible the exponent spread in the YouTube data is much too
large particularly for the subcritical case We have also performed simulations with
N0  500 and N0  50000 ie one order of magnitude in either direction from the
results reported here
In studying the ensemble average of 700 such timeseries from
these simulations we nd that we cannot reject at the 95 signicance level the
hypothesis that the data are the same as those we have reported for N0  5000 In
other words the size of the initial shock does not aect the statistics of the resulting
timeseries For the small initial shocks N0  500 the spread of individually tted
exponents is indeed larger than those we show here with N0  5000 and vice versa for
the larger shocks N0  50000 This is simply due to the tting method being more
less aected by statistical uctuations The peaks of the exponent distributions do
not however change appreciably

71 Classifying timeseries
Crane and Sornette do not have a priori knowledge of which dynamic class each
timeseries belongs to Because the exponents do not fall into clear classes they use
a classication method based on the fraction of the total views that arise on the day
of maximal viewing termed the peak fraction F 
This fraction is of course a
measure of the steepness of the subsequent decay hence of 
In our simulations
since we know hi and hence which class any given timeseries is actually in we can
look at the peak fraction and see if this method allows for any misclassication The
classication according to F in 1 is to consider F  08 as an exogenous subcritical
decay 02  F  08 as exogenous critical decay and F  02 as endogenous critical
decay There are some further comments that the classication between the two
exogenous cases is not signicantly altered when varying the boundary between F  07
and F  1 We have not calibrated our simulations to any of Crane and Sornettes
data and hence do not know how long the time increment in our updates is relative
to their data The boundaries we choose for classication will therefore not have the
same numerical values this will not however invalidate our study of the classication

method We nd that our simulated timeseries show two well-dened peaks in the
distribution of peak fractions Choosing a cut-o of F  02 to dene exogenous critical
and F  02 to dene exogenous subcritcal decay recall we do not treat the endogenous
case results in no misclassication

In both cases there is an obvious divide between
subcritically decaying timeseries and critical decays For a suitably placed boundary
between high and low peak fractions F  02 this method correctly classies every
single timeseries we have studied
8 Conclusions
The observed behaviour of the Hawkes process subject to external shock is for the case
of a single-valued  distribution exactly as predicted in Refs1 5 When  is drawn
from a broad distribution the numerical values of the decay exponent are modied
but the overall picture of critical and subcritical decays remains Our results show a
signicant spread of tted decay exponents though much less than that seen in the
YouTube data reported in 1 We can however shed some light on this We have good
control of all the timeseries we t to in particular we ensure that they are all subject
to the same size of uctuation by always studying the same size of shock Crane
and Sornette do not have this luxury Our tting to the tails of individual timeseries
shows that the exponent can vary widely if the statistics are poor in some instances
the best-t exponent is very dierent from that of the underlying distribution of which
a given timeseries represents a single sample It seems likely that some of the breadth
Hawkes process as a model of social interactions a view on video dynamics
in the range of exponents seen in 1 is caused by considering many timeseries with
poor statistics in the tail By only considering timeseries with particularly large peaks
relative to the background viewing rate a set of decay exponents with lower variance
might be obtained Of course this would have a cost in terms of the overall statistics
of the sample
In addition our study shows that the peak fraction classication method is a
good one and we suggest that carrying out this classication and then tting to the
ensemble average of suitably normalised timeseries may give the best estimate of the
decay exponents We have also shown that the least squares tting method gives results
that are not very dierent from the maximum likelihood approach favoured here
Our results demonstrate a way to test if  is really a unique global constant
equivalently drawn from a -function distribution The ensemble-averaged timeseries
in this case are measurably dierent from those where  is broadly distributed with the
same mean Particularly we observe a crossover eect in the critical decay for a broad
 distribution that is not present if  is constant
If the timeseries can be correctly
classied using the peak-fraction method an ensemble average of suitably normalised
critical timeseries might be diagnostic of whether  is eectively constant or not
Finally we reiterate that although our analysis of synthetic Hawkes process data
results in a spread of tted exponents within each dynamic class this intrinsic noise does
not fully account for the much wider distributions seen in the YouTube data of Crane
and Sornette 1 This suggests limits to the universality concept which presumably
underlies attempts to classify activity bursts in social systems into robust dynamic
classes 1 While the Hawkes process is clearly useful in analysing real-world data
from complex social systems some fairly basic observables such as the variance of the
exponent distribution for individual activity bursts are seemingly not captured by it
These aspects are thus either nonuniversal or lie in the universality class of a more
complex model than Hawkes
