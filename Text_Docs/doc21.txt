In vivo localization of FADD 
Tourneur et al  
Abstract 
FADD  Fas-associated  death  domain  is  the  main  death  receptor  adaptor  molecule  that 
transmits apoptotic signal Recently FADD protein was shown to be expressed both in the 
cytoplasm and nucleus of in vitro cell lines In contrast to the cytoplasmic FADD the nuclear 
FADD was shown to protect cells from apoptosis However in vivo subcellular localization 
of  FADD  was  still  unknown  Here  we  demonstrated  that  FADD  protein  was  expressed  in 
both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment in ex vivo thyroid cells demonstrating that nuclear 
sublocalization of FADD protein was a relevant phenomenon occurring in vivo Moreover 
we  showed  that  in  the  nucleus  of  untransformed  thyroid  cells  FADD  localized  mainly  on 
euchromatin We confirmed the nuclear localization of FADD in ex vivo liver and showed 
that in this organ FADD and MBD4 interact together These results demonstrate that FADD is 
physiologically expressed in the nucleus of cells in at least two mouse organs This particular 
localization opens new possible role of FADD in vivo either as an inhibitor of cell death or as 
a transcription factor or as a molecular link between apoptosis and genome surveillance

Introduction 
Normal thyrocytes constitutively express the Fas death receptor but not the Fas ligand 
FasL  1-3  However  FasL  expression  in  thyroid  follicular  cells  TFC  can  occur  under 
numerous thyroid pathological conditions including autoimmune diseases and cancer 4-6 
For instance FasL expression has been reported in TFC from patients suffering of Graves 
disease  7  and  Hashimotos  thyroiditis  8  the  two  main  thyroid  autoimmune  disorders  in 
humans and thyroid carcinomas 6 In these pathologies thyrocytes appear to be relatively 
insensitive to Fas-mediated cell death although expressed FasL is functional 9-12 Reasons 
for such phenomenon are not clearly established and probably involve several mechanisms 
such as expression of FLIP FLICE-inhibitory protein and Bcl-xL anti-apoptotic molecules 
11 or loss of FADD Fas-associated death domain pro-apoptotic protein 13 Interestingly 
normal TFC are naturally resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis suggesting that the observed high 
insensitivity  of  pathological  thyrocytes  could  result  from  an  intrinsic  property  of  normal 
thyroid  cells  Since  FADD  physically  interacts  with  death  receptors  located  at  the  cell 
membrane  FADD  protein  was  thought  to  be  mainly  cytoplasmic  Recently  we  reported  by 
mean  of  an  in  vitro  organ  culture  the  existence  of  a  new  regulatory  mechanism  of  FADD  protein 
expression following adenosine receptor signaling 14  
Furthermore the human FADD protein contains both a nuclear export and a nuclear 
localization  sequence  which  account  for  FADD  localization  both  in  the  cytoplasm  and  the 
nucleus respectively 15 Whereas cytoplasmic FADD possesses pro-apoptotic functions it 
was recently reported that FADD expression in the nucleus protects cells from apoptosis 15 
The mechanism implicated in this survival function has not been investigated  
As dogmas can be challenged FADD nuclear sublocalization has been debated It was 
found that FADD primarily resided in the nucleus of cells and thereafter shuttled from the 
nucleus to the cytoplasm 16 In contrast other report showed that FADD was exclusively

located in the cytoplasm of most adherent and non adherent cell lines 17 It now appears that 
the  discrepancies  between  these  two  studies  likely  resulted  from  different  technical 
approaches 18 19   
Although it is now demonstrated that FADD is expressed in the nucleus of both human 
and mouse cell lines 20 and in the nucleus of human lung adenocarcinoma cells 21 no 
data are available concerning the FADD subcellular localization in non transformed cell in 
vivo Thus one important issue that needed to be clarified was the in vivo FADD subcellular 
localization Regarding the innate resistance of TFC to apoptosis and the important role of 
the Fas pathway in thyroid autoimmune and tumoral diseases we addressed this issue in ex 
vivo mouse thyroid sections We demonstrated for the first time that nuclear localization of 
FADD protein is not a cell line dependent event We confirmed this result in mouse liver and 
showed that FADD is linked to MBD4 in vivo

Results and discussion 
Animals were sacrificed and the thyroid removed The two thyroid lobes were either 
immediately  covered  in  optimal  temperature  embedding  medium  for  immunofluorescence 
analysis  Fig  1  or  immediately  fixed  with  glutaraldehyde  for  immunogold  electron 
microscopy Fig 2 To avoid the problems associated with permeabilisation reagents such as 
saponin  18  19  we  performed  thyroid  cryosections  that  we  immunolabeled  with  the 
previously characterized specific anti-mouse FADD antibody 13

Confirming  our  previous  study  13  confocal  immunofluorescence  microscopy 
analysis  showed that FADD protein was expressed in the cytoplasm of all TFC Figure 1 A 
E G and in all thyroid examined independently of the genetic background of the mice data 
not shown Moreover we observed that FADD was additionally localized in the nucleus of 
some but not all TFC Fig 1 A B E-G In contrast omission of the primary antibody or 
staining  with  an  isotype-matched  control  antibody  showed  no  positive  reactivity  in  the 
nucleus Fig 1 C D H-J and data not shown To confirm these results and to localize more 
precisely the FADD protein in TFC we used immunogold electron microscopy This method 
allowed us to detect FADD protein both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of TFC Fig 2 A 
and  B  confirming  the  results  obtained  by  confocal  microscopy  Furthermore  the  electron 
microscopy technique showed that FADD was expressed in the nuclear compartment of all 
the TFC examined data not shown  
The different cell-types in tissue samples provided useful internal comparators when 
assessing FADD immunolabelling We found that FADD protein was not or barely detected 
in  the  nucleus  of  endothelial  cells  from  blood  vessel  which  are  localized  between  thyroid 
follicles Fig 2 E and F Since FADD was present in the nucleus of ex vivo mouse thyroid 
cells  our  data  demonstrated  that  nuclear  localization  of  FADD  protein  was  not  an  in  vitro 
culture  cell  line  dependent  event  However  the  TFC  restricted  pattern  of  expression  of 
nuclear FADD protein in thyroid gland suggested that nuclear sublocalization of this protein 
may not be a common feature and may depend on cell type Finally we confirmed that FADD 
could  be  expressed  in  the  nucleus  of  cells  in  vivo  using  a  third  approach  which  is  cellular 
fractionation  Because  of  the  large  amount  of  protein  needed  for  such  technic  we  used 
proteins of ex vivo mouse liver instead of thyroid We chose liver to compare with thyroid 
because both hepatocytes and thyrocytes are epithelial cells Whatever the amounts of protein 
extracts loaded on SDS-PAGE we detected FADD expression both in the cytoplasmic and

nuclear fractions Fig 3 A Quantification of bands obtained by western blot showed that the 
nuclear  FADD  represents  one  third  of  the  total  FADD  protein  demonstrating  that  in  this 
organ FADD is mainly cytoplasmic Fig 3 B These results confirmed that FADD is present 
in the nucleus of two types of mouse epithelial cells in vivo  
We observed that part of FADD was localized in the nucleus This result differed from 
several results reporting the nuclear localization of only a minor fraction of FADD On the 
other hand it was in line with the results reported in adherent cell lines in which  FADD seems 
to  primarily  reside  in  the  nucleus  and  thereafter  to  translocate  to  the  cytoplasm  16  a 
phenomenon which depends on phosphorylation at serine 194 Here in we estimated that in 
our setting around 20 of the total FADD was localized in the nucleus  
FADD is a complex molecule and some of its assigned properties have not been yet 
fully  demonstrated  For  instance  the  death  effector  filaments  DEF  structures  are 
cytoplasmic filament network composed of death effector domain DED-containing proteins 
including FADD 22 that recruit and activate pro-caspase 8 23 However the existence of 
DEF has not been established in vivo and increasing evidences suggest that DEF could be 
structures resulting only from protein over-expression 15 16 Indeed DEF formation has 
always been observed in the context of FADD protein over-expression and DEF have been 
characterized  as  detergent-insoluble  in  contrast  to  endogenous  FADD  which  is  soluble  in 
NP40  or  triton  Here  we  demonstrated  that  the  ability  of  FADD  to  localize  in  the  nuclear 
compartment  is  a  natural  phenomenon  since  it  occurred  in  primary  normal  cells  ex  vivo 
Moreover we showed that FADD protein localized in the nucleus of thyrocytes and liver cells 
in physiologic conditions as well as in the cytoplasm demonstrating that in vivo FADD does 
not have exclusive subcellular localization in these two cell types  
The function of nuclear FADD in contrast to the well established role of cytoplasmic 
FADD  in  cell  death  24  25  is  poorly  understood  Whereas  FADD  interaction  with  death 
In vivo localization of FADD

receptors activates caspase activation cascade in the cytoplasm thus leading to the apoptotic 
death of the cell nuclear FADD appears to be implicated in survival mechanisms 15 It has 
been suggested that sequestration of FADD in the nucleus could protect cells from apoptosis 
by hindering FADD-triggered caspase interactions in the cytoplasm 16 Indeed it has been 
demonstrated  in  cell  line  that  the  methyl-CpG  binding  domain  protein  4  MBD4  could 
interact with FADD in the nucleus The relative level of FADD MBD4 and caspase 8 may 
determine the apoptotic output of the cells 18 Here in we tested if FADD could interact 
with  MBD4  in  vivo  We  performed  coimmunoprecipitation  experiments  using  rabbit 
polyclonal anti-MBD4 or anti-FADD antibodies and revealed the presence of FADD protein 
by specific western blotting We could not perform the converse experiment since the anti-
MBD4  did  not  work  well  for  western  blot  detection  Immunoprecipitates  obtained  from 
nuclear  extract  of  liver  cells  contained  a  FADD  signal  in  contrast  to  those  obtained  with 
isotype-matched  control  rabbit  IgG  Fig  4  The  anti-FADD  antibody  did  not  allow 
immunoprecipitation  of  all  the  nuclear  FADD  since  the  protein  was  still  detected  in  the 
supernatant  after  immunoprecipitation  Fig  4  A  By  contrast  all  the  nuclear  FADD  was 
immunoprecipitated by the anti-MBD4 antibody demonstrated that all the nuclear FADD was 
bound to MBD4 Fig 4 A  
These  results  demonstrated  that  FADD  interacts  with  MBD4  in  vivo  This  interaction  by 
contributing to FADD sequestration in the nucleus could be involved in protection of cells 
from death receptor-mediated apoptosis Alternatively knowing the key role of MBD4 in GT 
mismatches  repair  26  MBD4-FADD  interaction  could  link  genome  surveillanceDNA 
repair and apoptosis in liver cells in vivo  
On the other hand FADD could be a transcription factor which could induce anti-apoptotic 
gene expression 15 Interestingly using immunogold electron microscopy we observed in 
the nucleus of TFC that the FADD protein localized almost exclusively on euchromatin ie

noncondensed DNA Fig 2 B-D This particular localization was observed in nucleus of all 
TFC data not shown These results are in favor of FADD playing a role as a regulator of 
transcription in thyroid cells Now that we have demonstrated the dual subcellular localization 
of FADD in TFC further experiments are needed to determine whether nuclear FADD is a 
real transcription factor and whether it might regulate expression of anti-apoptotic gene in 
particular in pathological TFC This could contribute to the high resistance of TFC to death 
receptor-mediated cell death despite the concomitant presence of FADD in the cytoplasm 2 
13 Characterization of potential FADD-DNA binding sequences or FADD-protein binding 
partners in nucleus might provide keys for this concept
