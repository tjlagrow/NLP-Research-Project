ABSTRACT
We use the number counts of X-ray selected normal galaxies to explore their
evolution by combining the most recent wide-angle shallow and pencil-beam deep
samples available The dierential X-ray number counts dNdS for early and
late-type normal galaxies are constructed separately and then compared with
the predictions of the local X-ray luminosity function under dierent evolution
scenarios The dNdS of early type galaxies is consistent with no evolution out
to z  05 For late-type galaxies our analysis suggests that it is the sources
with X-raytooptical ux ratio log fXfopt  2 that are evolving the fastest
Including these systems in the late-type galaxy sample yields evolution of the form
 1  z27 out to z  04 On the contrary late-type sources with log fXfopt 
2 are consistent with no evolution This suggests that the log fXfopt  2
population comprises the most powerful and fast evolving starbursts at moderate
and high-z We argue that although residual low-luminosity AGN contamination
may bias our results toward stronger evolution this is unlikely to modify our
main conclusions

redshifts Hornschemeier et al 2003 Bauer et al 2004 Georgakakis et al 2004 Norman
et al 2004 Georgantopoulos et al 2005 This development has opened the opportunity
to explore the evolution at X-ray wavelengths of the dominant population of the Universe
normal galaxies powered by stellar processes rather than accretion on a supermassive black
hole The unique feature of X-rays is that they are the only tool available to directly probe
the X-ray binaries and the hot gas in galaxies providing complementary information on their
evolution compared to other wavelengths eg Ghosh  White 2001
The evidence above has motivated a number of studies which use dierent approaches
to constrain the evolution of X-ray selected normal galaxies Stacking of optically selected
spirals in the Chandra Deep Field North provided the rst evidence for evolution of these
systems at X-ray wavelengths Brandt et al 2001 Hornchemeier et al 2002 A more direct
method which however requires the detection of individual systems is to estimate the X-ray
luminosity function at dierent redshift bins eg Norman et al 2004 A simpler but
equally instructive technique uses the observed number counts in comparison with model
predictions assuming dierent forms of evolution eg Ranalli Comastri  Setti 2005
The general consensus from the complementary methods above is that the X-ray evolution
of normal galaxies to z  1  15 is similar to that obtained from other wavelengths eg
Hopkins 2004
In addition to the studies above which mainly concentrate on deep surveys eg Chan-
dra Deep Fields aiming to select high-z normal galaxies there have also been eorts to
identify such systems at low redshifts Georgakakis et al 2004 Georgantopoulos et al 2005
Georgakakis et al 2006 These samples are complementary to deep surveys providing a
tight anchor point at low-z that is essential for any conclusions on evolution Despite the
signicant progress in the eld however there is still limited number of studies that exploit
all the complementary low and high-z samples available to constrain the evolution of normal
galaxies over as a wide redshift range as possible
In this paper we expand on previous results on the X-ray evolution of normal galaxies by
combining the most up to date wide-angle shallow surveys probing on average lower-z with
the latest compilation of normal galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field North and South Bauer
et al 2004 These samples are used to construct the dierential X-ray number counts of
normal galaxies over about 4 dex in ux and to compare against dierent evolution models
We further improve on previous studies by splitting the sample into early and late-type
galaxies to explore their evolution separately This is particularly important since dierent
galaxy types are expected to follow dierent evolution patterns Throughout this paper we
adopt Ho  70 km s1 Mpc1 M  03 and   07

2 Sample selection
In this paper we combine normal galaxy samples compiled from independent wide-area
shallow and pencil-beam deep surveys spanning a wide range of uxes fX05  2 keV 
1013  1016 erg s1 cm2
At the bright ux end we use galaxies identied in i the Needles in the Haystack
Survey NHS Georgakakis et al 2004 Georgantopoulos et al 2005 ii the 1st release of
the XMM-Newton Serendipitous Source Catalogue 1XMM prodcued by the XMM-Newton
Survey Science Centre see Georgakakis et al 2006 for the galaxy selection and iii public
Chandra observations analysed as part of the XAssist project Ptak  Griths 2003 that
overlap with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Schneider et al 2005 For the latter
sample full details on the eld selection and normal galaxy identication will be presented in
a future publication The galaxy catalog for this sample is electronically available from the
web httpwwwastronoagrxrayXAssist-SDSStxt In brief sources are detected in the
03-8 keV band of ACIS pointings with exposure times  20 ks to avoid observations that are
too shallow to be useful for our purposes Fluxes in the 05-2 keV band are estimated from
the 03-8 keV count-rates in the XAssist catalogue assuming a power-law spectral energy
distribution with   18 The sensitivity curve in the 05-2 keV band for these observations
is constructed using methods described in Georgakakis et al 2006
The total area of the combined bright sample 1XMMNHSXAssist is about 15 deg2
with a sensitivity curve shown in Figure 1 A total of 68 normal galaxy candidates are
selected by searching for sources with log fXfopt  2 soft X-ray spectral properties to
avoid type-II Seyferts and optical spectra available for 55 of the 68 sources consistent with
stellar emission rather than AGN activity For the log fXfopt calculation we adopt the
denition of Stocke et al 1991 assuming   18 and B  V  08
At faint uxes fX05  20 keV  1017  1015 erg s1 cm2 we use the CDF-North
and South Alexander et al 2003 Giacconi et al 2002 to identify normal galaxy candi-
dates We focus in particular on a total of 104 sources 28 in CDF-S and 76 in CDF-N
classied normal galaxies by Bauer et al 2004 on the basis of their X-ray and optical
properties eg hardness ratios X-ray luminosity optical emission lines which appear con-
sistent with stellar processes This sample has a less stringent X-raytooptical ux ratio
cut log fXfopt  1 compared to the galaxies identied in the shallow surveys above
Because of evolution andor dierential X-rayoptical k-corrections a more stringent X-
raytooptical ux ratio cut eg log fXfopt  2 is likely to aect more seriously these
deeper samples which probe on average higher redshifts resulting in incompleteness On
the contrary the log fXfopt cut is likely to has little impact in the brighter lower-z samples
described above eg Georgantopoulos et al 2005 Tzanavaris et al 2006 see section 4

3 Galaxy classication
The normal galaxies identied in the surveys above are classied into early and late
types by tting galaxy templates to their broad band colours For the X-ray bright samples
presented here we use primarily the SDSS-DR4 ugriz photometry for spectral tting A
total of 12 systems from the 1XMM catalogue do not have SDSS observations available in
which case we rely on visual inspection of their optical spectra for classication For the
CDF-South we use the COMBO-17 photometry eg Wolf et al 2003 while for the CDF-
North we also employ the SDSS-DR4 ugriz photometry The exception are 7 CDF-North
systems fainter than the SDSS limit for which we use the multiwaveband observations of
Barger et al 2003 UBV RIzHK
The template SEDs are constructed by smoothly interpolating between the 4 galaxy
types of Coleman Wu  Widman 1980 ES0 Sbc Scd Im extended in the UV and IR
wavelengths using the GISSEL98 code eg Bruzual  Charlot 2003 This method provides
a total of 60 SEDs from ellipticals spectral classication 0 to extreme starbursts spectral
classication 60 Sources with best-t SEDs in the range 025 are classied early type This
spectral range is in good agreement with the visual classication of the optical spectra eg
absorption lines when available
Table 1 summarizes the galaxy types found in the four dierent surveys It is evident
that the bright 1XMM NHS and XAssist samples which include only low redshift galaxies
z  02 consist of roughly equal numbers of early and late type galaxies
In contrast
the fainter CDF surveys consist primarily of late-type galaxies This suggests that late and
early type galaxies have dierent evolution with cosmic time A quantitative analysis and a
detailed discussion of this point are presented in the next section

4 The galaxy X-ray number counts
In this section we discuss the number density of X-ray selected normal galaxies over
4 decades of ux in the context of evolution models We choose to use the dierential
galaxy counts dNdS instead of the cumulative log N  log S frequently employed in X-ray
astronomy because of the independence of individual ux bins simplifying the estimation of
errors and the interpretation of the results
Some contamination from low-luminosity AGN is expected in the ultra-deep Chandra
elds used here which comprise on average higher-z systems that are harder to study in
detail Therefore the full Bauer et al
2004 sample used here total of 104 galaxies
likely represents close to the upper bound in the number density of X-ray selected normal
galaxies We also independently consider galaxies in the Bauer et al 2004 sample with low
X-raytooptical ux ratio log fXfopt  2 The AGN contamination in this restricted
subsample is expected to be minimal in the expense of possibly missing powerful starbursts
or massive ellipticals suggested to occupy the log fXfopt  2 region of parameter space
eg Alexander et al 2002 Bauer et al 2002 More recently Tzanavaris et al 2006
cross-correlated the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey with public XMM-Newton and Chandra
observations and found a non-negligible fraction normal galaxies at z  01 mostly early
types however with log fXfopt  2 The evidence above suggests that the Bauer et
al 2004 CDF-North and South restricted subsample with log fXfopt  2 is likely to
represent the lower bound in the number density of normal galaxies
Figure 2 presents the 05-2 keV dierential counts for all normal galaxy candidates in the
ux range fX0520 keV  10171013 erg s1 cm2 identied in the surveys described in
section 2 The dNdS in this gure is constructed using the sensitivity curve shown in Figure
1 We consider separately the two samples that include i all the Bauer et al 2004 galaxies
and ii only those systems in the CDF-North and South with log fXfopt  2 The former
is hereafter referred to as the full sample while the latter is dubbed the restricted sample
We t the unbinned data for these two galaxy samples with a power-law using the parametric
Maximum Likelihood method This yields slopes of 247  004 and 222  005 for the
full and restricted samples respectively Using the full sample and adopting the combined
early and late-type X-ray luminosity function XLF of Georgakakis et al 2006 assuming
luminosity evolution of the form 1  zp we nd p  192  035 This is consistent with
the evolution derived by Norman et al 2004 and Ranalli et al 2005 The dNdS of
the restricted sample with log fXfopt  2 is best t with negative values of p implying
no-evolution The evidence above suggests that in the case of the total sample both early
and late types the evolution is driven by the log fXfopt  2 systems
In addition to the total galaxy counts we also consider early and late-type galaxy sub-

samples independently Figure 3 plots the dNdS for evolved galaxies according to the
classication presented in section 3 The full and restricted subsamples for early-type galax-
ies are plotted separately delineating the upper and lower X-ray number density limit of
evolved galaxies In the case of the full subsample using the parametric maximum likeli-
hood method and assuming luminosity evolution of the form  1  zp for the Georgakakis
et al 2006 early-type XLF we constrain p  059078
059 consistent with no evolution The re-
stricted subsample requires negative values of p implying either incompleteness of the CDFs
due to the log fXfopt  2 cuto or uncertainties in the earlylate type classication Nev-
ertheless the evidence above suggests that optically classied early-type galaxies show little
if any evolution at X-ray wavelengths at least out to z  05 the median redshift of
evolved galaxies in the CDFs
In Figure 4 we plot the dierential counts for late-type galaxies These are compared
with the dNdS estimated by integrating the late-type galaxy XLF of Georgakakis et al
2006 assuming dierent scenarios for the evolution of this population The restricted
subsample comprising systems with log fXfopt  2 appears in agreement with the no
evolution model Indeed a maximum likelihood t to the data parameterising the evolution
as  1  zp for the Georgakakis et al 2006 late-type XLF yields p  041085
041 consistent
with no evolution On the contrary a similar analysis for the full subsample gives p  270 
035 suggesting evolution out to z  04 the median redshift of the late-type subsample
This suggests that it is the log fXfopt  2 galaxy population that evolves the faster
Indeed these sources are suggested to comprise a large fraction of starburst galaxies expected
to show most dramatic evolution with redshift eg Alexander et al 2002 The evolution
derived here for the late-type sample is comparable within the uncertainties to this of the
full sample This is not surprising as most of the galaxies at high redshift which drive
the evolution are late-types The derived evolution at X-ray wavelengths is consistent
with that estimated for star-forming galaxy samples selected at other wavelengths eg
Hopkins 2004 Therefore the late-type X-ray population studied here closely maps the
star-formation history of the Universe at least out to the median redshift of the sample
z  04 The evolution rate derived here p  270  035 is consistent with those models of
Ghosh  White 2001 that adopt a slow evolution timescale for the low-mass X-ray binary
population  1 Gyr Shorter timescales predict exponents much higher than that derived
here almost independent of the star-formation history of the Universe at higher redshift
Finally we caution that low-luminosity AGN contamination may be present in our
sample This problem is likely to be more severe for higher-z systems where weak AGN
optical signatures are harder to identify against the stellar continuum eg Severgnini et al
2003 Although the presence of low-luminosity AGN may bias our results to higher values
for the evolution parameter p we argue that this is unlikely to modify the main conclusions

presented here The X-ray spectra of many low luminosity AGN are indeed dominated by
thermal emission below about 2 keV Levenson Weaver  Heckman 2001 Terashima et al
2002 suggesting stellar processes Even if the late-type galaxy sample used in this paper has
some level of residual AGN contamination this is likely to have only a minor contribution
to the 05-2 keV employed here
