Abstract In this article we study the kinetics of reversible ligand binding to receptors on a spherical cell 
surface using a self-consistent stochastic theory  Binding dissociation diffusion and rebinding of ligands 
are  incorporated  into  the  theory  in  a  systematic  manner  We  derive  explicitly  the  time  evolution  of  the 
ligand-bound receptor fraction pt in various regimes  Contrary to the commonly accepted view we find 
that  the  well-known  Berg-Purcell  scaling  for  the  association  rate  is  modified  as  a  function  of  time 
Specifically the effective on-rate changes non-monotonically as a function of time and equals the intrinsic 
rate  at  very  early  as  well  as  late  times  while  being  approximately  equal  to  the  Berg-Purcell  value  at 
intermediate  times    The  effective  dissociation  rate  as  it  appears  in  the  binding  curve  or  measured  in  a 
dissociation  experiment  is  strongly  modified  by  rebinding  events  and  assumes  the  Berg-Purcell  value 
except  at  very  late  times  where  the  decay  is  algebraic  and  not  exponential  In  equilibrium  the  ligand 
concentration everywhere in the solution is the same and equals its spatial mean thus ensuring that there is 
no depletion in the vicinity of the cell  Implications of our results for binding experiments and numerical 
simulations of ligand-receptor systems are also discussed  
1 Introduction 
A  large  number  of  cellular  processes  are  triggered  by  ligand  binding  to  cell  surface 
receptors  In  contrast  to  reactions  taking  place  within  a  test  tube  ligand-receptor  cell 
binding involves reactants that are not well-mixed primarily because the receptors are 
confined to the cell surface  In addition the ligand concentration close to the surface is 
subject to fluctuations arising from association and dissociation processes The kinetics of 
ligand-receptor  binding  could  therefore  deviate  substantially  from  the  traditional 
ordinary differential equation ODE based descriptions which are appropriate for well-
mixed reactants whose densities remain constant in space 1  
A  related  issue  is  the  history-dependence  of  the  binding  process  arising  from  the  re-
attachment  of  dissociated  ligands  to  the  cell  surface  at  later  times  For  this  reason  any 
effective equation describing the binding kinetics has to be necessarily non-local in time 
an  interesting  feature  which  does  not  seem  to  have  been  widely  appreciated  in  the 
literature  The  traditional  approach  starting  with  the  classic  paper  on  bacterial  chemo-
sensing by  Berg and Purcell 2 and later extended by other authors 345 has been to 
find  the  effective  rate  constants  by  solving  for  the  steady  state  ligand  flux  to  the  cell 
surface Berg and Purcell showed that for a spherical cell of radius  a  with  N  receptors

of these results  
The  scaling  relations  for  the  binding  and  dissociation  rates  mentioned  above  have  been 
found  to  agree  well  with  experimental  results  67  are  widely  used  in  biochemical 
modeling  and  have  also  been  extended  to  cell  surface  reactions  In  addition  Berg  and 
Purcells  well-known  result  for  the  relative  error  in  concentration  measurement  by  a 
chemotactic cell like the bacterium E Coli follows directly from Eq1 It is therefore 
of  interest  to  re-examine  the  validity  of  the  quasi-steady  state  assumptions  where  the 
ligand  concentration  is  assumed  to  reach  a  stationary  profile  much  faster  than  the 
receptors under which these relations were derived and look for possible modifications 
in  a  more  systematic  theory  In  addition  we  note  that  in  the  previous  theoretical 
treatments  association  and  dissociation  processes  are  treated  separately  and  in 
particular effects of ligand rebinding on the association kinetics are neglected altogether 
89  An  attempt  towards  a  unified  treatment  of binding  and  dissociation  was  made  by 
Goldstein  and  Dembo  10  However  this  technique  method  of  weighted  residuals  is 
essentially perturbative in nature and does not always predict the correct kinetic behavior  
For  example  in  the  pure  dissociation  problem  the  asymptotic  decay  is  algebraic  but 
MWR predicts exponential decay10 
In  this  paper  we  generalize  a  recently  introduced  self-consistent  stochastic  formalism 
1112 originally developed to study ligand rebinding to uniformly distributed receptors 
on  a  planar  surface12  and  later  extended  to  include  receptor  clusters11  to  study 
association  and  rebinding  of  ligands  to  receptors  on  a  spherical  cell  in  solution  Being 
based on the statistics of individual ligand trajectories this formalism eliminates the need 
to  impose  ad  hoc boundary  conditions  for  the  variation  of  ligand  concentration  close  to 
the cell surface We derive the ligand-bound receptor fraction explicitly as a function of 
time  and  thus  derive  the  effective  rate  constants  We  observe  deviations  from  Berg-
Purcell scaling close to equilibrium and show that the association rate equals the intrinsic 
rate and the ligand concentration at the surface equals its spatial mean value on solution 
at  equilibrium  We  discuss  experimental  implications  of  our  findings  and  also  test  the

21 General formalism 
Let  us  consider  a  spherical  cell  of  radius  a in  three  dimensions  with 
receptors  distributed  randomly  on  its  surface 
exposed  to  a  ligand  in  the  surrounding  medium  whose  concentration  at 
infinite distance from the cell is 
0R being  the  surface  density  The  cell  is 
  and  at 
 the fraction of ligand-bound 
receptors at time t  The basic kinetic equation for 
0  Let us denote by 
               3 
k  and 
tr  is the radially  symmetric ligand concentration at distance from the center 
k  are the dissociation and association rates of the ligand to 
of the cell at time  t  
the  receptor  For  the  rest  of  this  section  we  will  assume  that  internalization  of  ligand-
receptor complexes by the cell can be neglected in comparison with dissociation

in  the  form
  is  the 

density contribution from the bulk ie from the ligands which have not been bound to 
a  receptor  until  time  t   although  they  may  have  been  reflected  earlier  by  bound-
receptors  or  the  non-receptor  part  of  the  surface  The  ligands  that  make  up
t   and  released  during  the 
those  which  were  receptor-bound  at  an  earlier  time 
interval
 Let us now define a Greens function for ligand diffusion around the 
semi-absorbing  sphere  centered  at 
  is  the  probability 
density  dimension  1length 3   that  a  ligand  that  starts  at  a  radial  distance  r   from  the 
 is located close to the surface at time  t  with possibly multiple visits to the 
origin at 
semi-absorbing surface in between but no absorption by a receptor Using this Greens 
function the above two densities may now be expressed as 
taGpdNk

           4a 
The first relation is obvious In order to understand the second relation let us assume the 
ligand  under  consideration  was  bound  to  a  receptor  last  at  time    and  was  released 
during  the  interval 
is  the 
total number of bound receptors at time  and the probability that the ligand returns to 
t   without  being  absorbed  by  a  receptor  in  between  is 
the  surface  in  the  interval

  Note  that  we  have  assumed  complete  spherical  symmetry  of  ligand 
diffusion which is justified for a uniform distribution of receptors as is the case here 
  which  takes  place  with  probability  dk
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
The  separation  of  the  surface  ligand  density  into  bulk  and  rebinding-originated  parts  is 
the  first  new  feature  of  our  formalism  The  second  feature  is  the  expression  of  these 
densities  in  terms  of  Greens  function  for  individual  ligand  diffusion  trajectories  in  the 
presence of a semi-absorbing surface The Greens function is computed in the next sub-
section

The  formalism  in this  section  is  very  similar  to what  was presented  in  our  earlier paper 
  which  is  the

probability per unit volume that a ligand at radial distance  r  at t0 arrives close to the 
surface for the first time at time t which is related to

reside  inside  a  volume  element 
gives the probability that the ligand arrives at the surface for the first time at t the second 
term gives the sum of all other events The factor 
 gives the probability 
0Rk 
of non-binding upon contact with the surface In general close to equilibrium we need to 
correct  for  the  number  of  occupied  receptors  which  can  be  done  approximately  by 
replacing 
 in  See also the note following Eq9b 
0R  by 
In  order  to  calculate
  we  next  consider  the  case 
completely reflecting as far as ligand diffusion is concerned In this case 
Eq5 reduces to  
  so  that  the  surface  is 
1  and hence 
We will now re-express Eq5 and 6 in terms of Laplace-transforms 
 between the equations which produces the elegant relation

Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
After substituting Eq8 into Eq7 and using the basic equations Eq4a and 4b we arrive at 
the  following  expressions  for  the  Laplace  transforms  of  the  densities  For  the  bulk 
density we find 
           9a 
where the factor is defined in Eq2 Inversion 13 gives 
where the last expression illustrates the approach to the steady state value at large times 
  The  density  contribution  from  receptor-released  ligands  after  using 
the theorem for convolutions in Eq4b is given by 
For kinetics close to the steady state the factor  N in Eq2 and the denominators of Eq7 
Eq9a-c should be corrected for the number of ligand-bound receptors which is done by 
replacing  N  by 
 in these places See Eq18 and Eq19 later 
3 Results 
The kinetics in various time regimes may now be worked out by inverting Eq9a and 9c 
and substituting in Eq3 We now study three important cases of interest 
31 Early time regime 
This is equivalent to the regime 
 for which Eq9a gives 
 so that 
  which  is  to  be  expected  In  this  limit 
tr   is  negligible  since  release  and 
 tb
rebinding events are significant only after a considerable fraction of receptors are bound 
to ligands The association curve in this regime is therefore

Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
is of the order of 
32 Intermediate regime 
  This  regime  is  of  very  little  practical  interest  since  the  time-scale 
310  seconds only for 
cm and 
cm 2 s 1  
In this case we consider the regime beyond the microscopic time scale
receptor  occupancy  by  ligands  is  still  small  ie 
 but the 
  In  this  case  using  the 
condition 
  we  find  from  Eq9a  that 
  ie  the  bulk-
contributed density is now only a fraction of the constant density at infinity Eq9b can 
also be inverted trivially in this regime to give 
     for 
Let us now substitute for 
tb  and 
tr  in Eq3 The resulting equation is 
For consistency we neglect the quadratic term in pt  and to linear order we have

backward rates

arguments discussed in the introduction 24 
33 Late time regime and steady state

We  now  proceed  to  analyze  the  kinetics  in  the  asymptotic  regime  when  the  system  is 
close  to  equilibrium  Let  us  first  assume  that  at  very  late  times  the  quantities 
 respectively Let us therefore 
 assume their steady state values 
consider small deviations of the form

close  to  the  steady  state  In  terms  of  Laplace-transformed  variables  the  equivalent 
relations are 
    16 
We  now  substitute  these  expressions  in  Eq9a  and  Eq9cand  the  following  relations 
follow easily The steady state bound fraction is 
where the equilibrium surface concentration is

Note that the scaling factor 
s1
in Eq9a and is defined as  
 appearing in Eq18 is slightly different from the factor 
  19 
As  mentioned  earlier  this  approximate  modification  reflects  the  reduction  in  the 
number  of  available  sites  for  ligand  association  as  binding  progresses  Upon  solving 
Eq17 and Eq18 together it is easily seen that 
 and hence
0 s
in Eq18 and Eq19 From Eq17 it also follows  then that
ie the ligand density close to the surface at equilibrium is the same as the bulk density 
This is in fact true everywhere in the solution see Appendix C Note that this result is 
r  and the correction factor 
crucially dependent on the inclusion of the rebinding density 
 ie 
the  equilibrium  bound  fraction  is  insensitive  to  kinetic  modifications  of  rate  constants 
ie extrapolating  Eq10 and Eq13 to 
Having  found  the  steady  state  in  a  precise  manner  we  now  proceed  to  calculate  the 
leading kinetic terms close to the steady state After substituting Eq15 into Eq3 we find 
the following equation for
tp  up to linear terms in the deviations 
gives the same equilibrium value

In the final step of the procedure the expansions Eq24a and Eq24b are used in Eq23 
which is then substituted into Eq21 After a few elementary simplifications we arrive at 
the final result 
We see that this regime is characterized by a time-scale

The  time  evolution  in  this  regime  is  still  exponential  with  the  time  scale  defined  by 
Eq26 Eq26 and Eq27 are the principal results of this paper Note that unlike the time 
scale appearing in Eq13 in Eq26 only the dissociation rate is scaled by the factor
s1
whereas the association rate has now recovered to its original intrinsic value  
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
It  would  appear  from  our  analysis  that  unlike  what  is  found  using  the  standard  Berg-
Purcell-Shoup-Szabo rates Eq13 the equilibrium dissociation  constant 
as measured from the binding curve would be time-dependent remaining at its intrinsic 
 over the early and intermediate regimes of evolution but later settling down 
at a different value smaller than the intrinsic value by a factor
s1
  Note however that 
the steady state bound fraction still depends only on the intrinsic 
dK  Eq17 This means 
that  care  should  be  taken  when  the  effective  rate  constants  as  extracted  from  kinetic 
measurements are used to predict quantities like the steady state receptor occupancy 
Although possibly  of  little  experimental  relevance  let  us  also  take  a  look  at  the  regime 
 which is arbitrarily close to equilibrium The kinetics which is now very 
slow since we are very close to the steady state already in this regime controlled by the 
  Inversion1    of  Eq25  and  using  the  appropriate 
  term  in  Eq25  since

At  very  late  times  therefore  the  binding  curve  approaches  its  equilibrium  value 
algebraically  The  power-law  approach  to  the  final  steady  state  is  in  agreement  with  a 
general  result  in  the  theory  of  bimolecular  reactions  which  predicts  that  in

d dimensions  equilibrium  is  approached  asymptotically  as

been  assumed  here  In  any  realistic  situation  however  the  number  of  ligands  is  finite 
and  therefore  the  absorption  by  receptors  will result  in  a  reduction  in  their  number  and 
hence  the  mean  concentration  Nevertheless  our  main  conclusion  that  there  is  no 
depletion region for the ligand concentration close to the cell should still be valid 
In  Fig1  we  have  depicted  the  time-variation  of 
tr   for  typical  parameter 
 The total surface 
t   is  also  shown  for  the  same  parameter  values  which  clearly 
tb  and Eq27 for 
ts   and 
ligand  concentration 
displays the non-monotonic variation in time as argued above 
34 Time-dependent association rate 
The time-dependence of the surface ligand concentration may also be framed in terms of 
a time-dependent association rate which may be defined as 
The  advantage  of  this  approach  especially  for  numerical  simulations  is  that  all  the 
effects of concentration fluctuations due to ligand release and rebinding are taken care of 
in this new effective association rate and no separate treatment of rebinding eg by using 
a  reduced  dissociation  rate  as  in  Eq13  is  needed  For  the  dissociation  rate  we  may 
therefore simply use the intrinsic value 
In order to study the time-dependence of the effective association rate over time-regimes 
of experimental interest let us concentrate on the intermediate and late-time regimes as 
tr  is given 
defined earlier In the intermediate regime we have 
by Eq11 Upon combining the two and making use of Eq17 we find that

A compact expression that smoothly interpolates between Eq30 and Eq31 in the 
appropriate time-regimes may be obtained by defining the factor 
             
using which we find an approximate expression for the effective on-rate for all times 
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
             
Eq33 provides a compact although not completely rigorous since the introduction of the 
factor 1-pt in Eq32 is of an ad-hoc nature and this additional time-dependence has not 
been included in the Laplace transform method used earlier expression which smoothly 
interpolates between the correct limiting forms given by Eq30 and Eq31 This form may 
be  suitable  for  use  in  computational  studies  of  ligand-receptor  interactions  where 
rebinding  and  consequent  fluctuations  in  ligand  concentration  close  to  the  surface  are 
deemed  important  and  may  be  captured  at  least  approximately  A  specific  example  is 
discussed in Section 5 
4 Experimental implications 
In experimental studies of ligand-receptor binding the quantity that is typically measured 
is the time evolution of 
 for which the effects of ligand release and rebinding on the 
binding  kinetics  are  more  subtle  and  less  direct  as  opposed  to  the  ligand  concentration 
itself  Our  analysis  predicts  that  as  long  as  the  bound  fraction  is  sufficiently  small  the 
binding curve may be very closely approximated to an exponential with both the on and 
off-rates  scaled  by  the  same  factor  1
  Eq13  and  Eq14  However  closer  to  the 
steady state the time scale of the exponential undergoes a change and switches to 
sT  in 
  Eq26  Although  there  is  a  significant 
which  only  the  off-rate  is  scaled  by 
s1
change in the surface ligand concentration the qualitative nature of the binding curve is 
likely  to  be  only  subtly  altered  since  both  time  scales  are  involved  in  determining  the 
kinetics  of  evolution  In  particular  the  cross-over  from  Eq18  to  Eq27  is  likely  to  be 
difficult to observe in practice This is particularly true if the equilibrium bound fraction 
  for  which  the  transient  regime  might  well  extend  almost  up  to 
is  small  ie
equilibrium For example in the experiments of Erickson et al that verified Berg-Purcell 
scaling 6 by effectively tuning the number of receptors this fraction was below 05 in 
most cases  The authors also state that  corrections due to the reduction in free receptor 
number due to binding were never observed which lends further support to our assertion  
In order to see the differences in time evolution as predicted by Eq13 and Eq27 in two 
different

Upon  comparing  Eq34  with  Eq35  we  find  that  the  curves  approach  each  other  in  the 
  In  these  cases  the  distinction  between  the 
two  limiting  cases 
1   andor
intermediate and asymptotic regimes of evolution is unlikely to be sharp 
A  precise  estimation  of  the  regime  where  the  intermediate  regime  of  evolution  Eq34 
crosses  over  to  the  asymptotic  regime  Eq35  may  be  obtained  by  demanding  that  the 
quadratic  term  in  pt  in  Eq12  is  small  compared  to  the  linear  term  The  condition  for 
applicability of Eq13a or Eq34 then turns out to be 
For small values of 
1 
evolution is minor as we have already remarked Larger values of 
sp  the difference between the asymptotic and intermediate modes of 
sp  increase the time 
range of applicability of Eq13a  In both cases therefore the over-all time evolution of 
pt  will  be  dominated  by  the  intermediate  regime  given  by  Eq13a  and  34  except  for 
cases where 
 In the experiments of Erickson et al 6 the authors indicate 
that  the  best  fit  to  the  Berg-Purcell  prediction  was  obtained  with  parameter  values

    Upon  substitution  these  parameter  values  place    approximately  in  the

range 05 - 40 and  in the range 033-08 The equilibrium receptor occupancy 
reported as less than 05 in most of the experiments For concreteness let us use
cm 3 s 1   for  N   in  the  range 
  cm 3 s 1   and 
  the  applicability  of  the  intermediate 
  and  thus  extends  over  almost 
we  then  find  from  Eq31  that  even  for 
regime  is  valid  over  time  intervals  such  that 
the entire time regime up to saturation  
To summarize it is not surprising that the experiments of Erickson et al did not notice 
any  difference  between  the  effective  on-rate  constants  measured  from  i  the  slope  of 
initial  rise  of  the  data  curve  and  ii  by  fitting  the  entire  data  curve  to  a  theoretical 
function In order to see the effect predicted in the present paper it would be necessary to 
do  an  exponential  curve-fitting  at  both  ends  of  the  binding  curve  ie  near

values 17  can be found in Table 1 and the complete set of equations used are given in 
Appendix  D    The  primary  question  was  whether  application  of  Eq  33  would  lead  to 
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
differences  in  EGF  binding  curves  when  compared  to  the  Berg-Purcell-Shoup-Szabo 
effective rate constants Eq14 or simply using the intrinsic rate constants  Note that the 
dissociation rate constant was maintained at the intrinsic binding rate when coupled with 
Eq 33 since effects of rebinding were pooled into that expression 
A  slight difference in the fraction of receptor-ligand complexes formed as  a function of 
time  was  evident  when  using  Eq  33  compared  to  the  intrinsic  association  rate    and 
negligible difference when compared to using the Berg and Purcell expressions data not 
shown    The  maximal  value  of    for  this  system  was  02    which  suggests  that  the 
impact  would  be  small  here    The  differences  resulting  from  the  time-dependent 
association rate expression are better illustrated when the diffusion coefficient is lowered 
10 Fig 
by a factor of ten and the k is increased by a factor of five which resulted in 
2A  Table  1      At  early  times  the  new  expression  Eq  33  leads  to  similar  kinetics  to 
those of Berg and Purcell despite differences in the dissociation rate terms but quickly 
leads  to  kinetics  mirroring  that  of  the  intrinsic  rates    However  in  all  cases  the  same 
steady-state  level  of  complexes  was  obtained    Note  that  although  the  intrinsic  rate  of 
dissociation  was  used  in  the  simulations  for  the  dissociation  rate  with  Eq33    the 
effective dissociation rate found from experiments ie rate found if data was analyzed 
with  a  simple  ligand-receptor  binding  model  would  be  altered  from  the  intrinsic  value 
due  to  rebinding  which  in  our  analysis  is  dealt  with  through  the  time-dependent 
association rate given by Eq33 
We  then  asked  how  the  rate  expressions  would  impact  a  more  complex  system  where 
there were two ligands competing for the single receptor  Using a second mutant EGF 
ligand where the intrinsic association rate was set equal to EGF but the off-rate differed 
by  an  order  of  magnitude  we  simulated  a  competition  binding  study  at  4C  with  equal 
concentration of EGF and the higher affinity mutant 1 ngml Fig 2b  The effects are 
present  using  baseline  EGF  values  Table  1  data  not  shown  but  as  with  the  single 
ligand  system  are  more  prominent  when  a  lower  diffusion  coefficient  and  higher 
association  rate  are  used      As  expected  the  level  of  mutant  EGF-EGFR  complexes 
exceeds  those  of  EGF-EGFR  with  all  three  rate  expression  types  intrinsic  values  Berg 
and Purcell expressions and Eq33  The new expression matches the Berg and Purcell 
expression  for  early  times  for  both  mutant  EGF  complexes  and  EGF  complexes  but 
begins to track with the intrinsic rate in less than 10 min  All three expressions resulted 
in similar late time  60 min complex levels in agreement with the single ligand system  
There was some overshoot of the steady-state EGF-EGFR levels evident with all three 
expressions although none were large   
We next simulated conditions where there was an excess of mutant EGF 5 ngml mutant 
to  1  ngml  EGF  and  asked  how  the  unequal  concentration  impacts  complex  formation  
Trends  seen  with  the  EGF  mutant  with  regard  to  complex  formation  at  equal 
concentrations added were found with the only difference being the  significantly higher 
binding  levels    Complex  formation  with  EGF  however  was  somewhat  different  in  that 
the  overshoot  was  much  more  pronounced  Fig  2c    In  all  cases  the  levels  of 
complexes overshot the steady-state level with the new expression resulting in a larger 
overshot compared to either the intrinsic rate or the Berg and Purcell expression  This 
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
behavior  was  evident  whether  the  mutant  was  of  higher  or  lower  affinity  data  not 
shown  Clearly the differences in the kinetic behavior between Eq33 and the standard 
Berg-Purcell rates can be appreciable and could be important in situations where kinetic 
measurements play a crucial role  
6 Discussion 
Ligand binding to receptors on a spherical cell surface is a classic problem and has been 
studied  by  several  authors  starting  with  the  monumental  work  of  Berg  and  Purcell  2 
Although  differing  in  details  much  previous  work  has  essentially  dealt  with  calculating 
effective rate constants for the binding and dissociation of ligands 2-5 The underlying 
idea  was  that  the  effects  of  diffusion  limited  transport  of  ligands  and  the  non-
homogeneous distribution of receptors in space ie their confinement to the cell surface 
could  be  absorbed  into  these  effective  rates  The  question  of  the  detailed  nature  of  the 
kinetic  binding  curve  was  not  explicitly  addressed  although  it  seems  to  have  been 
generally assumed that once the intrinsic rates were replaced by these effective rates the 
standard  mean-field  space-averaged  rate  equation  would  be  sufficient  to  describe  the 
kinetics This assumption was questioned by Goldstein and Dembo 10 who pointed out 
that this assumption is of an ad-hoc nature However the technique they used although 
more  systematic  than  the  ad-hoc  approach  is  perturbative  in  nature  and  fails  to  predict 
the correct behavior in all the time regimes    
In  this  paper  we  have  developed  a  self-consistent  stochastic  approach  to  the  binding 
problem which has been built upon a similar formalism presented by us earlier to study 
ligand dissociation and rebinding in the presence of receptor clusters 11 The principal 
idea  behind  this  approach  is  to  look  at  the  problem  in  terms  of  individual  ligand 
trajectories  and  derive  an  expression  for  the  Greens  function  of  ligand  diffusion  in  the 
presence  of  the  semi-absorbing  cell  surface  The  final  expressions  for  the  cell  surface 
ligand concentration Eq7 and 8 involve only macroscopic experimentally measurable 
parameters like the ligand association rate and the receptor surface density  
Our results confirm the validity of the commonly used quasi-steady state approximation 
and the associated Berg-Purcell scaling relations over a certain well-defined time regime 
However we also predict that deviations from this relationship  will be evident at larger 
times close to equilibrium In particular we predict that the effective association rate is 
asymptotically  the  same  as  its  intrinsic  value  but  undergoes  a  non-monotonic  change 
between  the  Berg-Purcell  scaling  regime  and  this  late  time  The  dissociation  rate 
however remains a fraction of its true value at all times beyond a short initial transient 
period due to rebinding effects Our principal prediction is that if ligands are lost from 
the  surface  only  through  dissociation  ie  provided  other  mechanisms  like  receptor-
mediated internalization can be neglected the ligand concentration at the cell surface in 
fact anywhere in the solution at equilibrium is the same as the ligand density at infinity 
However  significant  variations  with  time  leading  to  this  point  do  occur  and  have  been 
fully characterized in the theory Eq18  
Self-consistent theory of ligand binding 
Our  results  are  of  possible  implications  in  many  areas  The  quasi-steady  state  scaling 
assumption  for  association  and  dissociation  rates  are  widely  used  in  computational 
modeling  of  biochemical  reactions  describing  ligand-receptor  interactions  and  it  is 
important  to  determine  if  the  non-monotonic  change  in  the  on-rate  and  its  eventual 
saturation at the intrinsic rate as predicted in this paper has a  significant  effect on these 
types  of  results  It  would  also  be  of  interest  to  extend  the  ideas  in  this  paper  to  cell-
surface  two-dimensional  ligand-receptor  reactions  where  the  ligand  interacts  with  the 
receptor after absorption on the cell surface and reaching it by surface diffusion and is an 
area we are currently pursuing This could have direct relevance in the context of receptor 
clustering as in for example lipid rafts 18 The results might also be applicable to the 
question of  gradient detection in chemosensory  cells Investigations in this direction are 
currently  in  progress  and  will  be  reported  in  the  near  future    In  general  the  self-
consistent formalism that we have presented might be found to be of use in many other 
problems  where  external  ligandsmoleculesmonomers  are  absorbed  and  released 
simultaneously  eg  motor  proteins  attaching  to  and  detaching  from  microtubule 
filaments

We compute the probability density  for a ligand that starts from a radial distance  0r  from the center of a 
perfectly reflecting sphere of radius  a  to be present close to its surface at time  t  For this purpose let us 
   is  the 
r 24  at  time  t  By  this  definition therefore 
first  consider  the  general  Greens  function
  so  that 
probability  of finding the ligand in the  volume  element 
 and the initial condition for  Q  is  
 satisfies the diffusion equation 
along with the reflecting boundary condition 
 on the surface of the sphere

In  this  appendix  we  will  solve  the  pure  dissociation  problem  where  there  are  no  ligands  in  the  bulk 
solution to start with but a certain fraction p0 of receptors are ligand-bound at 
 We are interested 
 For simplicity we assume that p01 so that the effective equation for 
in the kinetics of
this case has the form 
After Laplace-transformation we find 
Let us now use Eq9b for

Clearly for very early times 
 in EqB3 the factor

Appendix C 
Although it is not directly relevant to the binding problem it is nevertheless interesting to look at the 
density profile of ligands in the bulk solution in the steady state using our formalism For this we need the 
general Greens functions 
0rtrG N
 which is again related to  
by Eq7 The latter is 
easily calculated using EqA6 We omit the details and give the result 
Using Eq 4a and 4b we now find that 
In the small s-limit it is easy to see from EqC2 and EqC3 that the two density contributions approach the 
steady state values
     and     
 signifies the reduction in the availability of free receptors due to binding as explained 
The factor

The bulk-ligand density grows away from the surface and eventually saturates to 
0  at infinite distance 
from the cell while the receptor-released ligand density falls away from the cell as we expect It is also 
easily verified that the sum

We set up simulations to mimic ligand binding performed at a 4C ie no synthesis and no internalization  
Ligands were added at time t0 and all receptors were assumed to be unbound at that time  For a single 
ligand case we used the equations 
where  R  is  the  number  of  unbound  receptors  L  is  the  ligand  concentration  C  represents  the  number  of 
ligand-bound receptors kf is the association rate kr is the dissociation rate and V is the media volume per

For the two-ligand system equations A2 and A3 are unchanged but A1 is rewritten as 
and we have the additional equations 
fk and 
where L2 is the competing ligand C2 is the competing ligand-receptor complexes and 
rk are the 
association  and  dissociation  rate  constants  for  the  competing  ligand    Note  that  in  simulations  the 
association and dissociation rate constants were varied between the intrinsic rate constants the Berg and 
Purcell expressions and the new expressions as explained above
