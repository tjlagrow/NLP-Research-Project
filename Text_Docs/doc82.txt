A critical step in the bacteriophage life cycle is genome ejection into host bacteria The ejection
process for double-stranded DNA phages has been studied thoroughly in vitro where after triggering
with the cellular receptor the genome ejects into a buer The experimental data have been inter-
preted in terms of the decrease in free energy of the densely packed DNA associated with genome
ejection Here we detail a simple model of genome ejection in terms of the hydrostatic and osmotic
pressures inside the phage a bacterium and a buer solutionculture medium We argue that the
hydrodynamic ow associated with the water movement from the buer solution into the phage
capsid and further drainage into the bacterial cytoplasm driven by the osmotic gradient between
the bacterial cytoplasm and culture medium provides an alternative mechanism for phage genome
ejection in vivo the mechanism is perfectly consistent with phage genome ejection in vitro

INTRODUCTION
Bacteriophages  phages for short  are viruses that
infect bacteria In order to infect a host the phage tail
 95 phage virions contain tails attaches to a bac-
terium which triggers the opening of the tail and the
genome usually double-stranded DNA is delivered in
some cases together with protein molecules into the cy-
toplasm Inside the capsid the genome is packaged at
near crystalline density 500 mgml for many double-
stranded DNA phages 1 where it is in a state of high
free energy due to DNA self-interactions causing high
osmotic pressure within a mature phage and to a lesser
extent 2 the mechanical energy cost incurred in bend-
ing the polymer into a compartment with a radius com-
parable to DNAs persistence length Energy for genome
packaging is provided by the bacterial cell in which the
phage was assembled From a purely thermodynamic
perspective the stored free energy within the capsid can
provide the driving force for DNA ejection with the DNA
acting essentially as a loaded spring that expands when
opening of the tail is triggered There may be separate
gates at the junction of the capsid and the tail tip but
we only consider the situation where all gates are either
open or closed The loaded spring concept has been
formalized in a continuum mechanics model 35 Keep-
ing in mind that the model applies only to equilibrium

states and not to the dynamics or molecular mechanism
of the process it successfully explains in vitro data for
phage  DNA ejection Such experiments include the
addition of capsid-permeable DNA-condensing agents or
capsid-impermeable osmolytes to arrest ejection when
the DNA remaining in the capsid reaches equilibrium
with the buer 69 and time-resolved light scattering
In addition uorescence microscopy experiments
following in vitro  DNA ejection in real time at the
single-molecule level show that the genome is ejected in
a single step at an ion-dependent rate but one that is
not a simple function of the amount of DNA remaining
in the capsid 9 11
Experimental data on osmotic suppression of DNA
ejection of phage SPP1 12 are consistent with the con-
tinuum mechanics model but those on T5 are less so
The extent of T5 DNA ejected after tail triggering is not
proportional to low external osmotic pressure and dif-
ferent populations co-exist at equilibrium 13 Further
DNA remaining in individual capsids was shown to un-
dergo several phase transitions as ejection proceeds 14
and there are distinct pauses where DNA exit from in-
dividual particles is temporarily halted 15 16 These
pauses do not correspond to the natural nicks in the T5
genome which are also not required for pausing and each
re-starting event requires overcoming the same activation
energy 1618 It is not known what causes pausing dur-
ing T5 DNA ejection
It is natural to imagine that the loaded spring concept
extrapolates directly to DNA ejection in vivo where the
ejection medium consists of the bacterial cytoplasm in-
stead of a buer solution It has however recently been
argued that many features of phage DNA ejection in vivo
are incompatible with this simple concept 1921 These
include the problems that the osmotic pressure inside
growing bacteria should prevent complete ejection of the
genome the eciency of phage infection being reduced
when bacterial turgor is low the stationary phase of bac-
terial growth ejection of proteins before and also likely
after DNA ejection and that some phages do not con-
tain DNA packaged to high density Furthermore several
phage types are known to eject their DNA slowly into
the bacterial cytoplasm in two or more distinct phases
These observations suggest mechanisms other than the
loaded spring may contribute to DNA ejection in vivo
In vitro ejection into a buer is a two compartment
process capsid bacterium with distinct osmotic and
hydrostatic pressures in each compartment In vitro the
net thermodynamic potential gradient for water move-
ment up the tail-tube which directly connects the two
compartments is positive so water tends to ow up the
tail-tube see later Ejection into a bacterium in vivo
however diers in subtle ways from ejection into a buer
In particular ejection in vivo involves three distinct com-
partments bacterium capsid environment instead of
two in vitro This is sketched in Fig I Each compart-
ment again has distinct osmotic and hydrostatic pres-
sures with ramications for the transport of the genome
out of the phage
Growing bacteria continuously draw in water from the
environment For this to occur a pressure imbalance
osmotic andor hydrostatic must exist between the bac-
terium and the environment We argue that the capsid
takes osmotic and hydrostatic pressure values that are
intermediate to those of the environment and the cyto-
plasm leading to water always owing down the tail-
tube While the rate of water entry into the cytoplasm
through the tail tube is at least three orders of magnitude
smaller than that through the cytoplasmic membrane
it can exert signicant local forces on DNA inside the
tail tube Further the pressure imbalance represents a
separate driving force for genome ejection independent
of the physics of the loaded spring model The hydro-
dynamic model of genome ejection 1921 is consistent
with many of the in vivo observations that are not readily
explained by the loaded spring concept 21 We further
argue below that the model has ramications for the in-
terpretation of in vitro data in particular the dynamics
of ejection
To date the hydrodynamic model has remained rel-
atively qualitative 20 21 The purpose of the present
article is to present a simple explicit formulation of the
model that retains its key physical ingredients Partic-
ular emphasis is given to the fact that the hydrostatic
pressure inside the viral capsid is free to adjust in re-
sponse to DNA ejection a factor that has been largely
ignored We show that such an analysis can assist the in-
terpretation of existing experiments as well as guide the
creation of articial model systems in which the physics

of genome ejection can be further elucidated
II DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL
In general we consider three compartments namely
the inside of the capsid the bacterial cytoplasm and
the surrounding culture medium environment We de-
note the osmotic and the hydrostatic pressures of these
compartments by c Pc b Pb and e Pe respec-
tively The variables e and Pe are treated as constants
that characterize the environment b and Pb similarly
dene the state of the bacterial cytoplasm c is a mono-
tonically decreasing function of the amount of DNA re-
maining in the capsid and Pc is free to adjust to the dy-
namics of DNA ejection The thermodynamic potential
for water movement from compartment 2 to compart-
ment 1 is simply given by

Assuming for simplicity that both water and the cap-
sid are incompressible during the ejection process the
continuity equation for water movement implies that the
rate at which DNA volume exits the capsid equals the
volume rate W t of the net water entry into the cap-
sid at all times Water entry into or exit out of the
capsid can occur via two distinct paths namely by per-
meating through the capsid or by owing through the
tail tube Having noted that the available cross-section
of the tail-tube is much smaller than the capsid cross-
section we assume that permeation through the capsid
is the dominant contribution to W t This simplication
can easily be relaxed but only at the cost of complicat-
ing the analytical form of the nal results without yield-
ing additional insights into the underlying physics We
further assume that i ejection is suciently slow that
all compartments bacterium capsid and environment
remains well-stirred or equivalently the water is fully
equilibrated in all compartments at all stages of ejection
ie the osmotic and hydrostatic pressures are uniquely
and uniformly dened in all compartments and ii wa-
ter entry into the capsid from the environment is in the
linear response regime Under these conditions

Here ADNA is the cross-sectional area of the DNA
VDNAt is the speed of DNA ejection and c is the cap-
sids permeability to water
Having neglected the rate of water ow through the tail
tube in comparison to the rate of water entry into the
capsid from the environment through the capsid shell
the dynamics of genome ejection both in vitro and in
vivo are qualitatively the same namely that water osmo-
sis into the capsid from the environment is accompanied
by DNA ejection from the capsid The physical force
responsible for DNA ejection is the hydrostatic pressure
gradient acting on the DNA across the tail tube and the
corresponding work done in ejecting the DNA is derived
from the free energy made available as water crosses the
capsid shell from the environment with osmotic pres-
sure e into the capsid with osmotic pressure c where

Although we neglect the contribution of the hydrody-
namic ow of water in the tail for the purpose of de-
termining the total ux of water into the capsid ow
in the tail does inuence conditions locally Specically
any ow of water in the tail vw exerts a force on DNA
also located in the tail via hydrodynamic drag In or-
der to estimate this force we represent the DNA as a
cylinder of radius R0 ie ADNA  R2
0 and let the
axis of the moving DNA coincide with the axis of the tail
tube at all times during ejection We denote the inner
radius of the tail tube by R We further apply no-slip
boundary conditions at the surface of the DNA and at
the inner surface of the tail tube Under this simplied
geometry the velocity prole for water in the tail tube
qr exhibits cylindrical symmetry and is only a function
of r the radial distance measured from the axis of the
DNA and qr can be easily determined by solving the
Stokes equation r1rrrqr  L with no-slip
boundary conditions Here  is the dynamic viscosity

Note that with  being a combination of xed parameters
and the freely adjustable capsid pressure the rhs of Eq

to uniquely determine these quantities we treat the in
vitro and in vivo cases separately
III HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL FOR IN VITRO
EJECTION
In the in vitro experiments the phage is immersed in
a buer solution creating a two-compartment congura-
tion one compartment is the inside of the capsid while
the other is the environment around the capsid Before
the opening of the tail is triggered there is no net move-
ment of water between these two compartments conse-
quently ce  0 and 21

This is analogous to the classic case of the van t Ho
water columns
Following triggering of the tail DNA begins to exit
the capsid while water simultaneously enters the capsid
from the environment
In order to obtain an explicit
expression for VDNAt it is necessary to specify the re-
lationship between VDNAt and the current state of the
system In principle this requires knowledge of the free
energy stored in the conguration of the DNA conned
inside the capsid This free energy is a sum of the in-
teraction energy of the capsid content DNA water ions
and possibly other protein molecules and the mechani-
cal energy stored in the DNA due to its packaging in tight
circles The mechanical energy is however an order of
magnitude smaller than the contribution from interac-
tions 2 in the spirit of constructing the simplest model
that captures the role of hydrodynamics we therefore

on the partially ejected DNA that experiences a hydro-
static pressure dierence Pcet  Pct  Pe across the
tail-tube is given by ADNAPcet
Thus having denoted the eective mass of the mobile
DNA by m where it is reasonable to assume that m is
of the order of the mass of the DNA cylinder within the

Equation 5 is easily solved as an integral equation for
VDNAt in which mADNA sets the transient time-
scale beyond which the inertial term m VDNAt term is
not relevant The transient time-scale for typical tail-
tube diameters and lengths is estimated to be in the range
of microseconds Given that the time-scales for in vitro
ejection is in the range of seconds 11 we neglect the

For the hydrostatic pressure Pc within the capsid the
result 7 points to two distinct possible regimes a For
high capsid permeability to water c cid29 ADNA the
hydrostatic pressure gradient Pct  Pe simply follows
the osmotic gradient ct e in a manner analogous to
Eq 4 b In the opposite limit ie for low capsid con-
ductivity the hydrostatic pressure gradient Pct  Pe
decreases abruptly when the DNA starts to eject follow-
ing the triggering of the tail The latter is the scenario
considered for in vitro DNA ejection in Ref 21
Which limit or where between the limits one should
observe is not a priori obvious Given that the choice
depends on the relative ease of water and DNA transport
between the capsid and the environment the choice likely
depends on the phage studied Some phages are resistant
to severe osmotic downshifts for example T7 infects nor-
mally when a suspension in  5M CsCl is added directly
to cells Conversely the classic Kleinschmidt picture of
T2 DNA emanating from a ruptured capsid is a result of
rapid dilution of a phage suspension in 2M ammonium
acetate 22 The resistance to osmotic downshift should
correlate well to the mobility of water through the capsid
membrane In that case we would expect T7 to conform
more closely to limit a than T2 which would be closer
to limit b
The nal important point to note is that when all mo-
tions of the DNA and water cease ie at the end of
ejection partial or complete as it may be then Eq 7
indicates that both osmotic and hydrostatic pressure gra-
dients between the environment and the capsid become
zero These situations correspond to the osmotic sup-
pression experiments 69 12 13 complete suppression
of ejection yields an estimate of the osmotic pressures in
a mature phage particle  25 atm for   47 atm for
SPP1 and  16 atm for the deletion mutant T5st0
IV HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL FOR IN VIVO
EJECTION
For in vivo situations it is important to appreciate
that water uptake by the cytoplasm from the culture
medium is very tightly regulated in a growing bacterium
which maintains an active osmotic gradient between the
environment and the cytoplasm A corresponding hy-
drostatic pressure gradient turgor helps the bacterium
enlarge 23 For instance the E coli cytoplasm has a
positive osmotic pressure of several atm above the envi-
ronment under various growth conditions the pressure
has been estimated to vary between 2 and 15 atm with
35-5 atm being commonly accepted values 24 25 This
osmotic pressure gradient is counter-balanced by a hydro-
static pressure dierential turgor 23 that enables the
cell to enlarge during growth 26 Gram-positive cells
such as Bacillus subtilis the host for phage SPP1 have
much higher turgor  19 atm 27 When the cell mem-
brane is breached by an infecting phage a new conduit
opens up for water to enter from the environment into
the cell cytoplasm by passing through the phage cap-
sid For the following analysis we treat the cytoplasm
as a uniform well-stirred medium for which the osmotic
and the hydrostatic pressures b and Pb remain constant
during ejection This is reasonable as bacteria respond
to osmotic perturbations within milliseconds
This situation is analogous to the in vitro case with
two important modications First the thermodynamic
potential dierence for water transport between the envi-
ronment culture medium and the bacterial cytoplasm
be which
in the light of the above paragraph is a
strictly positive quantity for a growing bacterium is given
be  bc  ce
Secondly the hydrodynamics in the tail tube is driven
by the themodynamic potential dierence cb bc
for water transport from the capsid into the bacterial
cytoplasm ie

Equation 11 shows that the rate of DNA ejection is
enhanced irrespective of the osmotic pressure dierence
between the capsid and the bacterium the driving force
behind this enhancement being the hydrodynamic drag
of water on the DNA in the tail tube while the source
of free energy being the osmotic imbalance between the
bacterium and its environment 1921 As pointed out
in Ref 21 be aiding the DNA ejection in vivo is consis-
tent with infection phenomenology No phage can com-
plete genome ejection without the be term in Eq 11
It is worthwhile to note in this context that the
DNA genome of phage P2 and its relatives is packaged
at a lower density than many other phages and a P4
genome has been packaged in a P2 capsid to yield an in-
fective particle in vivo 29 The genome length of P4 is
only one-third that of P2 and the internal osmotic pres-
sure is less than is necessary to even initiate DNA release
into the cytoplasm with only cb at its disposal Note also
that upon setting be  0 we recover the in vitro results
V CONCLUSIONS
We have introduced a simple model of genome ejection
in terms of the hydrostatic and osmotic pressures inside a
phage a bacterium and the surrounding medium This
model shows explicitly that the osmotic balance between
a bacterium and its environment provides a second source
of free energy for driving genome ejection that is indepen-
dent of the free energy stored in the conguration of the
DNA in the capsid The model also demonstrates that
water transport into the capsid and hydrodynamic drag
on the DNA in the tail pipe can profoundly inuence the
rate of genome ejection both in vitro and in vivo Fur-
ther renements to the hydrodynamic model in the sim-
ple form described here can be envisioned for example
accounting for a nite capsid elasticity or for the mechan-
ical energy stored in the DNA and this may prove nec-
essary for a quantitative comparison with experiments
However such renements are not expected to signi-
cantly change the physical picture described here
