Abstract
Rapid rebinding of molecular interaction partners that are in close
proximity after dissociation leads to a dissociation and association ki-
netics that can profoundly dier from predictions based on bulk re-
action models The cause of this eect can be traced back to the
non-Markovian character of the ligands rebinding time probability
density function reecting the fact that for a certain time span the
ligand still remembers the receptor it was bound to previously In this
manuscript we explore the consequences of the hypothesis that initial
binding and consecutive rebinding give rise to a bond lifetime density
that is non-Markovian as well We study the combined eect of the two
non-Markovian waiting time probability densities and show that even
for very short times the decay of the fraction of occupied receptors devi-
ates from an exponential For long times dissociation is slower than an
exponential and the fate of the the steady-state bound receptor fraction
critically depends on the extent of the deviation relative to the rebind-
ing time density from the Markovian limit The population of occupied
receptors may either decay completely or assume a non-vanishing value
for small and strong deviations respectively Furthermore we point
out the important role played by fractional calculus and demonstrate
that the short- and long-time dynamics of the occupied receptors can
be naturally expressed as well as easily obtained in terms of fractional
dierential equations involving the Riemann-Liouville derivative Our
analysis shows that cells may exploit receptor memory as mechanism to
dynamically widen the range of potential response-patterns to a given
signal

1 Introduction
Growing evidence 8 9 25 18 suggests that a ligands diusive motion
results in a receptor-ligand interaction pattern and a network response
further downstream that can deviate substantially from the picture
based on deterministic rst-order kinetics A major cause of these
dierences has been identied as the non-Markovian rebinding time
probability density function pdf that arises in stochastic spatially-
resolved accounts of the ligands motion 25 18 This rebinding time
pdf may be considered as a deformed version of the memoryless ex-
ponential waiting time pdf that corresponds to the rst order kinetics
of a deterministic mean-eld description In fact the rebinding time
pdf rebt for 1-dimensional diusive motion in the presence of a par-
tially absorbing boundary takes in the Laplace domain the form see
appendix A

aD is a parameter whose strength is determined by the
ratio of the intrinsic association constant a to the diusion constant

By contrast the exponential waiting time pdf that is commonly
employed to describe the dissociation reaction and association as well
in a non-spatial deterministic approach

Any PDF with   1 describes memory eects Because a ligand that
just dissociated from a receptor will remain close to that receptor for a
certain time span it is more likely to bind the same receptor again The
spatial correlations between receptor and dissociated ligand translate
to a time evolution of the ligands survival probability that is non-
local in time and hence give rise to a dynamics that can be naturally
cast as a fractional dierential equation Fractional calculus 19 17
plays a prominent role in anomalous diusion and non-equilibrium sta-
tistical mechanics of complex systems 14 23 16 24 12 26 but it also
naturally arises in the context of normal diusion To see this in more
detail let us recall that the rebinding PDF rebt of a single ligand
is related to the survival probability of a molecule that undergoes a
1-dimensional diusive motion in the presence of a partially absorbing
boundary condition BC at z0  0 by cf Appendix A

We have seen that fractional evolution equations Eq 7 that re-
ect deviations from a Markovian waiting time pdf naturally appear
in the decription of ligand rebinding even in the case of normal diu-
sion However the reverse process dissociation is usually taken into
account by a memoryless pdf for the bond lifetime even in particle-
based stochastic approaches however note for instance Refs 7 11
Here we suggest to abandon the assumption of the Markovian prop-
erty A deviation from a memoryless bond lifetime pdf is motivated
by several lines of experimental evidence suggesting that the receptor
state does not remain unaltered upon initial rebinding for instance
due to receptor deformation or conformational changes the formation
of signaling intermediates involvement of the actin skeleton and clus-
ter formation and other mechanisms 7 11 27 In the picture that
we will consider the bound state undergoes a diusion-like motion in
an abstract internal space whose properties are dynamically dened
by the local biochemistry near the receptor We will show that the
interplay of these two dierent diusive processes alters substantially
the apparent dissociation kinetics and can even lead to behavior that
has no counterpart in models that only take into account either the
non-Markovian character of the ligand rebinding or the bond lifetime
Let us recall how an altered receptor state may lead to a bond
lifetime pdf that is suciently well described by Eq 4 2 7 To this
end one assumes that the receptor modications imply a bond lifetime
pdf that is given by a superposition of exponentials
nent
One further assume that the sum can be approximated by an integral

Then using mild assumptions one can derive cf Appendix B that
asymptotically the pdf behaves like a power-law

Employing Tauberian theorems 6 12 one can show that
s  1   s
where  denotes a constant having dimension of time Now for large
times ie small s or for small  we nally may rewrite Eq 18 as
Eq 4 identifying 1  
Therefore we will henceforth assume that the bond lifetime pdf is
indeed given by Eq 4 We consider the following system Ligands
diuse in a 3 dimensional space that is semi-innite bounded by a two-
dimensional plane homogeneously covered with receptors We adopt
the self-consistent stochastic mean-eld theory approach of Ref 8 that
allows to track the motion of the ligand accurately while the receptors
are described in a non-spatial fashion by the fraction of occupied recep-
tors We point out that the formalism is exible enough to include also
a spatially-resolved description of the receptors 9 Here however we
aim at emphasizing the consequences of a non-Markovian bond lifetime
density and its interplay with the rebinding pdf and therefore limit our
analyses to a non-spatial receptor description
2 Theory
First we focus on the Markovian case 8 We consider a membrane
that extends innitely in the x y plane z  0 and that is uniformly
covered with receptors We assume that all ligands are initially bound
The fraction of occupied receptors is denoted by pt  RtR0 where
Rt and R0 refer to the density of bound receptors at time t and the
constant mean receptor surface density per unit area respectively Its
time evolution is governed by 8
 kopt  kon0 t1  pt
where z t describes the concentration of ligands at a distant z from
the membrane To solve Eq 19 one has to express the ligand density
0 t and hence the rebinding rate
t  kon0 t1  pt
in terms of pt To this end we follow the self-consistent mean-eld
theory approach described in Refs 8 and assume that p0  1 and
hence pt  1 for all times t so that the rebinding rate reduces to
t  kon0 t We now aim at expressing t in an alternative
form that incorporates spatially-resolved information about the diu-
sive motion of the ligand The fraction of occupied receptors which is
converted to the unbound state between time  and   d is given by
kop d  A dissociated ligand begins to undergo an eectively one-
dimensional diusive motion that starts at the mebrane z  0 between
time  and   d  Let St  z  0 denote the probability that a
ligand is still unbound when the time span t   has elapsed since the
dissociation Then the rate of absorption is given by by the rebinding
time pdf see Appendix C
rebt  Rradt  z0  0  St  z0  0
and it follows that the rebinding rate can be written as convolution
t  koZ t
d p Rradt  0
Note that despite the formal resemblance of Eqs 5 and 21 we
emphasize that the context of both relations is quite dierent because
here we consider a many-molecule system instead of a single ligand-
receptor pair Also the self-consistent mean-eld theory approach is
more exible and can be applied to more general cases 9
As it stands Eq 19 describes memoryless dissociation based
on the exponential waiting time pdf Eq 2 To introduce a non-
Markovian intrinsic bond lifetime we perform the substitution
ko  s

1  s
in the Laplace domain where s is given by Eq 4 with   ko
Clearly for   1 one recovers s s1  s  ko The substitu-
tion rule Eq 23 has been utilized before 2 21 However Refs 2 21
have not identied the action of the operation of Eq 23 in the time
domain Using 14

proach abandoning the assumptions of both a memoryless rebinding

and substituting E12Dt12  E1Dt1  expDt we
obtain from Eq 27 the deterministic Markovian mean-eld result

Next we turn to the general case and focus on the short and long time
limit We will show that in most cases the dynamics is described by
the same fractional relaxation law Eq 10 only the order of the R-L
derivative changes from case to case Hence as a benet the solutions
can be virtualy read o a fact which underlines the power and elegance
of the chosen formalism
3 Results
31 Solution for short times t  0
For very short times the eect of the rebinding should be negligible
This expectation is well reected by Eq 27 Because short times
imply that E12Dt12  1 it follows that the equation of motion
assumes the form of a fractional relaxation law

As we know from the behavior of the M-L function and can see from
Eq 31 for short times the fraction of occupied receptors decays like
a stretched exponential pt  p0 expkot
We emphasize that the solution given by Eq 30 is not only
valid for short times but in addition in parameter regimes in which
D  R0konD becomes small ie when either the receptor density
is small or when rebinding eects are weak ie the ratio of on-rate to
diusion constant becomes small Because for   1 the correspond-
ing M-L function in Eq 30 is a decaying exponential E1kot1 
expkot we recover the result from 8 for short times However
here we see that abandoning the assumption of a memoryless bond
lifetime leads to an decay that deviates from an exponential even for
short times or for small D
32 Solutions for long times t  
Now we will show that the combined eect of rebinding and receptor
memory gives rise to behavior that has no counterpart in cases in which
one uses only one of the two non-Markovian densities The long time
limit or equivalently s  0 implies that cf Eq 12
Lcid26E12Dt12cid27 
As a result Eq 27 again takes the form of a fractional relaxation
law as in the case of short times but the order of the R-L derivative
has changed cf with Eq 29
D112
Here we again emphasize that the found relaxation law is not only
valid for long times but also for regimes in which D becomes large
ie where rebinding eects becomes strong Furthermore the form
of Eq 33 makes it evident that there is now a crucial dierence
whether   12 or   12 ie whether the bond lifetime is to a
larger extent non-Markovian than the rebinding time pdf or not In this
sense diusion sets the scale for what should be considered a strong or
weak deviation from memoryless behavior Note that this scale is not
absolute If the ligand undergoes anomalous diusion 14 16 23 24
the scale will not be 12 anymore
We now consider several special cases separately First let us focus
on the Markovian limit   1 Then we immediately obtain from

where we employed the expansion of the M-L function for large argu-
ments Eq 14 We note that the fraction of occupied receptors will
completely decay for long times as in the Markovian case   1 How-
ever it can also be seen from Eq 35 that for general 12    1
the decay can become arbitrarily slow for   12 and hence   12
seems to play a special role that we are going to consider now
As previously the asymptotic solution pt   for the limiting
case   12 can easily be obtained from the general relaxation law
Eq 33 and using E0x  11  x

Thus we nd that the steady-state receptor occupancy is not vanishing
in the long time limit in stark contrast to the case of an exponential
decay of the intrinsic bond lifetime We point out that Agmon and
Weiss found a corresponding behavior for the case of a single pair in
one dimension 2 But as mentioned before the formalism adopted
here is more general 8 9 Moreover we establish a connection to
3D2D membrane binding as well as fractional calculus and the crucial
role of the fractional relaxation law
Finally we turn to the case   12 This is the only case for
which we cannot read o the solution immediately The reason is that
the nature of the R-L derivative changes qualitatively In fact let be
  12   then   0 and one has 14

Appendix B
In this Appendix we recall 2 7 12 how the form of the density 
that appears in Eq 16 can be derived from rather mild assumptions
First one assumes that a typical rate  is characterized by an Arrhenius
  e E
where k T refer to the Boltzmann constant and the absolute temper-
ature respectively The activation energies E themselves are assumed
to be distributed according to an Arrhenius factor too
E  e E
where E0 denotes a energy reference scale Using Eq 49 one may
express E by  and substitute the obtained expression in Eq 50 to
  
where   kT E0 Eq 16 denes a Laplace transform where  plays
the role of the time variable Hence knowing Eq 51 one may employ
Lt1  s   0 1 Eq 2937 to nally arrive at Eq 17

denotes the probability that a single molecule pair reaction takes place
when they encounter However here we are interested in a situation
where we consider many receptors Eq 52 remains valid 8 9 but
the probability  has to be adapted properly Following Refs 8 9
