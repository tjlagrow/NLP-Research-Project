Abstract The amount and nature of the evolution of the X-ray prop-
erties of clusters of galaxies provides information on the formation of
structure in the universe and on the properties of the universe itself The
cluster luminosity - temperature relation does not evolve strongly sug-
gesting that the hot X-ray gas had a more complicated thermodynamic
history than simply collapsing into the cluster potential well Cluster X-
ray luminosities do evolve The dependence of this evolution on redshift
and luminosity is characterized using two large high redshift samples
Cluster X-ray temperatures also evolve This evolution constrains the
dark matter and dark energy content of the universe as well as other
parameters of cosmological interest
Introduction
The evolution of cosmic structure is strongly dependent on the cosmology of the
universe Jenkins et al 1998 is one of the many papers describing this well
known result Clusters of galaxies as the most massive bound objects known
are the ultimate manifestations of cosmic structure building The evolution of
clusters is simple being driven by the gravity of the underlying mass eld of
the universe and of a collisionless collapse of cluster dark matter It should be
possible to calculate this evolution reliably compared to that of other objects
visible at cosmological distances such as galaxies or AGN Clusters are luminous
X-ray sources The X-ray emission mechanism is optically thin thermal radiation
from a medium nearly in collisional equilibrium about the simpliest situation
imaginable Thus observations of the X-ray evolution of clusters provide a robust
measure of the evolution of cosmic structure and thereby constrain the cosmology
of the universe
The cosmological model is described by a set of cosmological parameters
The present value of the Hubble parameter is H0  100 h km s1 Mpc1 When
needed h  05 will be used but almost nothing about evolution depends on the
precise value of h since data at two epochs are always compared The present
matter and dark energy densities in terms of the critical density are m0 and
0 respectively The amount of structure in the universe is described by 8
the present rms matter uctuations in spheres of 8 h1 Mpc This parameter
is a complicated way to describe the present normalization of the spatial power
spectrum of matter density uctuations Pk on a scale of k  02 h Mpc1

2 Cluster Luminosity - Temperature Relation Evolution
The relation between cluster X-ray luminosities and temperatures L - T rela-
tion is the oldest and best studied among cluster X-ray observables Early stud-
ies include Mitchell Ives  Culhane 1977 Mushotzky et al 1978 and Henry
 Tucker 1979 Recent comprehensive work includes David et al
1993
White Jones  Forman 1997 Markevitch 1998 and Arnaud  Evrard 1999
Figure 1 shows an example of this relation using a sample of 53 z  03 and 32
03  z  06 clusters all with ASCA temperatures Novicki Sornig  Henry
Although there is clearly a relation in Figure 1 there is also substantial
non-statistical scatter The scatter is approximately Gaussian distributed in
the logarithm of the luminosity at constant temperature The dispersion in the

logarithm of the bolometric luminosity logLbol is about 02 The scatter
is reduced if the eects of the cluster cooling centers are removed either by
modeling them Allen  Fabian 1998 excising them Markevitch 1998 or
only using clusters that do not have cooling centers Arnaud  Evrard 1999
Most observers adopt the simple functional form Lbol  CkT 1  ZA
where Lbol is the bolometric luminosity to describe their results The obser-
vations indicate that   3 However simple scaling relations predict   2
and A  15 This  discrepancy is usually resolved by positing that the cluster
gas has experienced some form of preheating prior to its heating through gravi-
tational collapse Evrard  Henry 1991 Kaiser 1991 Bialek Evrard  Mohr
2001 Tozzi  Norman 2001 Bower et al 2001 Preheating raises the tem-
peratures of low mass clusters more than those of high mass thereby breaking
the scaling relations These preheating models predict little or no evolution of
the L - T relation at least to redshifts  1 For example the model in Evrard
 Henry 1991 has   25 and A  0 An alternative to this idea invokes
cooling which is more ecient at lower temperatures and a small amount of
post collapse heating to break the scaling Voit  Bryan 2001 Little evolution
is expected in this model as well Thus the values of  and A provide clues to
the thermodynamic history of the cluster gas
It has recently become possible to constrain the evolution of the L - T
relation thereby testing these scenarios Figure 2 shows the constraints derived
by Novicki et al 2002 The evolution is mild A is consistent with 0 at the  1
level Similar results have been found by Henry Jiao  Gioia 1994 Mushotzky
 Scharf 1997 Sadat et al 1998 Donahue et al 1999 Reichart Castander
 Nichol 1999 Fairley et al
2000 and Arnaud Aghanian  Neumann
2002 Little or no evolution may then imply that the thermodynamic history
of cluster gas is more complicated than simply falling into the cluster potential
well at least for low mass clusters There was possibly some additional heating
prior to collapse andor cooling after collapse

3 Cluster X-ray Luminosity Evolution
The initial claim for cluster X-ray luminosity evolution was made over a decade
ago by Gioia et al 1990 and Henry et al 1992 using the Einstein Extended
Medium Sensitivity Survey EMSS The reported evolution was in the sense
that there are fewer high luminosity clusters in the past This conclusion has
not enjoyed universal acceptance However there are now many new samples of
clusters both at high and low redshift with which it may be tested
31 Cluster X-ray Luminosity Samples
Clusters are not standard luminosity candles Therefore searching for luminos-
ity evolution requires measuring the X-ray luminosity function at two epochs
and that requires constructing statistically complete samples at the two epochs
Fortunately measuring the X-ray luminosity is relatively easy It only requires
 25 photons for a 5 luminosity measurement so large samples are possible
with relatively modest observing time

yet be made for MACS and WARPS II for the latter case because the
individual cluster luminosities and redshifts are not yet published
numbers of z  03 objects are listed in the table The EMSS sample is from
Einstein Observatory observations the other samples are from ROSAT The
MACS and NEP samples come from the RASS2 ie they are contiguous all
other samples are from disjoint targeted observations with a region around the
target excised
Typically low redshift cluster samples contain several hundred X-ray bright
objects coming from one-third of the sky High redshift samples usually contain
several tens of faint objects coming from less than one-percent of the sky
32 Test For Cluster X-ray Luminosity Evolution In Seven High
Redshift Samples
Since the evolution appears to be a lack of objects at high luminosities simply
comparing the binned low and high redshift dierential luminosity functions will
not use the full statistical power of the sample In the limit that the evolution
is a downward step function above a certain luminosity such a comparison will
show no dierence between the two epochs unless upper limits are plotted
A more sensitive test is to compare the observed number of high-redshift
high-luminosity clusters to the expected number if the low redshift luminosity
function did not evolve This test accounts for clusters that could have been
found but were not
J Patrick Henry

of clusters for the low redshift components of ve high-redshift surveys
The sample denition is L0520  1043 erg s1 and 015  z  030
The grey bar assumes m0  10 0  00 the clear bar m0  03
0  07
Specically the test used here compares the number of observed clusters
with luminosities in the 05 - 20 keV band  2  1044 erg s1 except MACS
whose selection function limits the lowest luminosity to 29  1044erg s1 and
with 03  z  10 to the expected number assuming the REFLEX low redshift
luminosity function did not evolve Each of the seven high redshift samples
probes a dierent region of the L - z plane due to its dierent ux limit and
solid angle The average redshift and luminosity of the clusters after the above
cuts for all seven samples is 0495 and 47 1044 erg s1 respectively m0  10
0  00 Figure 3 summarizes the results All seven samples show evolution
most at a statistically signicant level The average ratio of the observed to
no-evolution numbers is 035  004 for m0  10 0  00 and 029  004
for m0  03 0  07
Figure 3 also shows that one systematic eect the assumed cosmology
is not important Another systematic eect is the choice of the low-redshift
luminosity function Using the BCS instead of REFLEX yields a ratio of 038 
004 for m0  10 0  00 the BCS investigators only gave results for this
cosmology Thus the choice of the low-redshift comparison luminosity function
is also not important The nal systematic investigated was whether the test
yields a null result a ratio of 1 at low redshift Figure 4 shows that it does
The average ratio of the observed to no-evolution numbers is 103  008 for
m0  10 0  00 and 087  008 for m0  03 0  07 This test is

limited to ve samples because the selection function for Bright SHARC has not
been published at low redshift and MACS does not attempt to be complete at
low redshift
These results show that there is no longer a question of whether cluster
X-ray luminosities evolve they do Seven nearly independent surveys show
some evolution with a combined signicance  15 Systematic eects do not
appear to be important The amount of evolution is about a factor of three at
L05 20  47  1044 erg s1 over the redshift range  01 to  05 It is now
time to better characterize the evolution
33 Characterizing Cluster Luminosity Evolution Using Two Large
High Redshift Samples
The rst large sample comes from combining the 160 deg2 EMSS and NEP
samples denoted HEN There are 109 objects with L0520  1  1043 erg s1
and 03  z  085 This size is comparable to the low-redshift samples There
are no clusters in common among the three samples and the overlap of their
survey regions on the sky is small only  5 which has been accounted for
statistically The HEN sample is large enough that a simple comparison of the
luminosity functions from it and REFLEX demonstrates the evolution clearly as
Figure 5 shows A Schechter function ts both the REFLEX and HEN samples
well Figure 6 gives the 1 2 and 3  contours for the slope and characteristic
luminosity again demonstrating evolution at high statistical condence At least
the Schechter function normalization and slope are evolving but the charcteristic
luminosity may not be Comparison of HEN with REFLEX shows a factor of 2
evolution at L0520  2  1044 erg s1 over the redshift interval 011 to 045

It is the nature of ux-limited samples that dierent luminosity objects are
predominately found at dierent redshifts Thus the luminosity functions in Fig-
ure 5 do not refer to unique epochs This situation may be overcome to some ex-
tent by tting to an evolving luminosity function termed the AC model The AC
model generalizes the Schechter funtion to nL z  n0zLzexpLL
with n0z  n01  zA and z  01  zC A maximum likelihood t of the
AC model to the unbinned luminosity and redshift pairs for the REFLEX and
HEN clusters gives the following n0  465058

The second large high redshift sample is the Massive Cluster Survey or
MACS This survey seeks a large sample of high luminosity clusters at high
redshift About 300 objects are expected if there is no evolution Presently the
survey is  90 complete and has 119 clusters Note that in Section 32 an
additional 10 systematic error has been added in quadrqture to the MACS
statistical errors
A nal sample of  130 objects means that MACS detects evolution also
at high signicance Figure 8 shows a nonparametric representation of this
evolution comparing the MACS and eBCS integral luminosity functions The
comparisons in Section 32 folded a model t to the REFLEX luminosity func-
tion through each survey selection function MACS nds a factor of  10
evolution at L0124  1045 erg s1 over the redshift interval 005 to 055
m0  10 0  00 Figure 8 also shows that the AC model ts the MACS
data well with no adjustable parameters and with few clusters in common be-
tween eBCSMACS and REFLEXHEN
Two high statistics high redshift samples agree on the amount and nature
of cluster X-ray luminosity evolution The previous apparent disagreements were
probably just poor statistics

34 Constraining Cosmology From Cluster Luminosity Evolution
Given the discussion in the Introduction the question naturally arises whether
cluster luminosity evolution may be used to determine the cosmology of the uni-
verse The diculty is the extra evolution experienced by the gas in addition
to that driven by gravity as the L - T relation shows Since X-ray luminosity is
proportional to the square of the gas density will this extra evolution be large
enough to mask that from gravity The weak evolution of the L - T relation
shows that the extra evolution occured before what is currently observable pos-
sibly allowing a simple correction Comparing data to a theory that incorporates
the observed L - T or L - M relation into the gravitational evolution predic-
tions has in fact been used to constrain cosmological parameters from cluster
luminosities eg Henry et al 1992 Borgani et al 2001 Viana Nichol  Liddle
4 Cluster X-ray Temperature Evolution
Perhaps a cleaner way to measure the evolution of cosmic structure using X-ray
observations of clusters is via cluster temperature evolution The temperature
is more likely to reect better the underlying gravity driven evolution than the
luminosity
41 Cluster X-ray Temperature Samples
Clusters are not standard temperature temperature baths Just as with luminos-
ity evolution measuring temperature evolution requires constructing tempera-
ture functions at two epochs Again statistically complete samples are required
at the two epochs However it is substantially more dicult to measure cluster
temperatures than luminosities At least 1000 photons are required to provide
a reasonable temperature measurement Obtaining large samples is dicult
Obtaining even two independent samples at high redshift has so far not been
possible Table 3 gives some properties of cluster temperature samples The last
column of the table gives the numbers of clusters with measured temperatures
from ASCA and with temperatures estimated from the L - T relation

high redshift clusters are unresolved by ASCA which when combined with the
low statistics does not permit corrections for cooling centers Figure 9 shows
the integral temperature functions at two epochs The same factor  2 evolution
seen in the luminosities is also seen in the temperatures
42 Cosmological Results From Cluster X-ray Temperature Evolu-
Deriving cosmological constraints from X-ray observations is a two-step process
The fundamental variable of the theory is an objects mass so the process starts
with a mass function The analytic mass function that best matches the large
N-body simulations comes from Sheth and Torman 1999 This function agrees
better with the simulations than does the venerable Press - Schechter 1974
function However the dierences are only a factor of  2
The evolution of the mass function is very sensitive to cosmological pa-
rameters but the mass of a cluster is dicult to determine So the mass
must be converted to a more easily observed quantity in this case the tem-
perature A top hat collapse is most often used to do that This theory
gives kT  1421
TMm0m0 0 z13hM15231  z Here TM is a fac-
tor near unity that accounts for the eects of partial virialization of the cluster
Its exact value comes from hydrodynamical simulations m0 0 z is the
ratio of the average cluster mass density to the background mass density for a
cluster that collapses at redshift z It has recently been determined for arbitrary
m0 and 0 by Pierpaoli et al 2001 M15 is the cluster mass in units of

One nal issue concerns the selection function X-ray clusters are selected
by ux not temperature That is the solid angle surveyed to a given ux limit
is known Pierpaoli et al 2001 circumvent this by using the L - T relation
to insure that their temperature and redshift selection was compatible with the
ux limits of existing samples Usually the ux limit is recast as a limit in the
luminosity-redshift plane and then the luminosity is converted to a temperature
via the L - T relation The dispersion in the L - T relation is included by
averaging over it which gives the solid angle surveyed for a given cluster of

Constraints on cosmological parameters presented here come from a max-
imum liklihood t of the evolution theory to the unbinned temperature and
redshift data for the samples in Figure 9 There are four interesting parameters
in the theory the matter and dark energy densities and the shape and nor-
malization of the matter power spectrum The eects of temperature errors are
included in the likelihood function Figures 10 and 11 show some of the results

result further assumes h  072  008
and microwave background observations Further all three bands intersect at
the same point in the plane m0  04 0  06 is consistent with all three
data sets at the  1 level For example Rubino-Martin et al 2002 show
that all CMB data reported to date plus the supernovae data from Perlmutter
1999a plus assuming h  04 - 09 yields m0  035  004 and
0  068  004 at 68 condence
The normalization of the power spectrum 8 agrees with the microwave
background normalization evolved to the present Figure 11a Thus the uctu-
ations seen in the CMB really do grow to form the clusters seen today The
present cluster sample size is not large enough to provide tight constraints on w
Figure 11b However w  -1 is a good bet considering the constraints provided
by supernovae and the CMB
43 Cluster X-ray Temperature Evolution Systematics
It is of course important to consider the eects of systematic errors on the
constraints derived in the last section The three eects considered here are 1
Using the older Press - Schechter 1974 mass function 2 Using an empirical
normalization of the mass - temperature relation ie TM from Finoguenov
Reiprich  Bohringer 2001 instead of a theoretical normalization 3 Setting all
temperature errors to 2 or the actual value whichever is less All systematics
eects considered change the constraint on 8 by  1 the constraint on m0
by  05 and the constraints on 0 and w by  1 Thus statistical errors
appear to dominate the error budget with the present sample size of about fty
objects

5 Conclusions
The L - T relation shows that the hot X-ray cluster gas experienced a more com-
plicated thermodynamic history than that resulting from the cluster collapse
There was possibly some heating prior to collapse andor cooling with lesser
heating after collapse
There is no longer a question whether cluster X-ray luminosities evolve
they do Seven nearly independent surveys show some evolution and system-
atics do not appear to be a big eect Large high redshift samples ie those
containing more than 100 clusters are needed to characterize the evolution Two
such samples currently exist HEN shows a factor of 2 evolution compared to
REFLEX at L0520  2  1044 erg s1 over the redshift interval 011 to 045
m0  10 0  00 MACS shows a factor of 10 evolution compared to eBCS
at L0124  1045 erg s1 over the redshift interval 005 to 055 m0  10
0  00
A cosmology with m0  04 0  06 is consistent with cluster X-ray
temperature evolution the cosmic microwave background and supernovae at
the  1 level The systematics of cluster temperature evolution constraints
on cosmology are a minor concern at present ie they are about the same size
as the statistical errors However this method is so statistically powerful that
systematics will be the dominate eect as soon as the sample sizes become only
a factor of two or three larger at least for the determination of 8
A more positive statement would be that an X-ray cluster survey of 10000
deg2 to a ux of F05 20  5  1014 erg cm2 s1 would yield  18 000 clus-
ters to z  15 and provide constraints of similar statistical quality as the up-
coming Planck and the proposed SNAP missions Petre et al 2001 In fact
the great complementarity of cluster evolution cosmic microwave background
and supernovae constraints exhibited in Figure 10 would provide a check on the
systematics of all three methods
