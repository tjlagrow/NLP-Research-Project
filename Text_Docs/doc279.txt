ABSTRACT
The growth of galaxies through adiabatic accretion of dark matter is one of the main drivers of
galaxy evolution By isolating it from other processes like mergers we analyse how it affects
the evolution of star clusters Our study comprises a fast and approximate exploration of the
orbital and intrinsic cluster parameter space and more detailed monitoring of their evolution
through N -body simulations for a handful of cases We nd that the properties of present-
day star clusters and their tidal tails differ very little whether the clusters are embedded in a
growing galactic halo for 12 Gyr or in a static one

1 INTRODUCTION
Since the time of their formation galaxies have undergone a
variety of transformations from major mergers to slow accre-
tion of dark matter and intergalactic gas Press  Schechter 1974
White  Rees 1978 Le Fevre et al 2000 Dekel et al 2009 As
old objects evolving in these galaxies globular clusters and dwarf
galaxies can potentially probe such changes and record some
of their signatures Krauss  Chaboyer 2003 Kravtsov  Gnedin
2005 It is thus important to understand how the evolution of galax-
ies has impacted present-day stellar populations Ideally theoretical
studies on this topic should account for the coupling between the
internal dynamics of small stellar systems clusters and dwarfs
and the effect of their galactic environment in cosmological con-
text However because of the wide range of scales and of physical
processes involved considering both aspects simultaneously can be
challenging
One possible approach consists in focussing on low-density
objects like dwarf galaxies where star-star interactions can be ne-
glected By adopting a collisionless treatment of gravitation in nu-
merical simulations one can efciently explore a wide parameter
space Such methodology is largely used in the studies of satellite
galaxies and tidal streams eg Penarrubia et al 2005 Bovy 2014
Bonaca et al 2014 Kupper et al 2015
But for denser systems like star clusters two-body relaxation
plays a paramount role in setting the ux of stars escaping the clus-
ter and thus in the evolution of the cluster Fukushige  Heggie
2000 Therefore gravitation must be treated in a collisional fash-
ion which involves an important numerical cost and forbids to do
so over galactic and cosmological scales see also Dehnen 2014
Therefore the large scale inuence is not yet considered self-

consistently in star cluster N-body simulations Up to now several
paths have been followed to implement the tidal effects from the
galaxy on a cluster
i the cluster remains within a single galaxy for its en-
tire lifetime eg Baumgardt  Makino 2003 Kupper et al 2010
Hurley  Shara 2012 Madrid et al 2012 Vesperini et al 2014
Webb et al 2014 The galactic potential is usually static and often
axisymmetric
ii the cluster is accreted from a satellite galaxy onto a mas-
sive galaxy The accretion event is often modelled by replacing one
galactic potential with another both static Miholics et al 2014
Bianchini et al 2015
iii the galactic potential is evolved using a separate galaxy sim-
ulation to allow for time-evolving non-analytical potentials and
include effects like galaxy mergers Renaud  Gieles 2013 or
even complex tidal histories in cosmological context Rieder et al
Although the last approach provides a relatively high level of
realism it does not allow us to distinguish the relative role of the
numerous physical processes involved in the evolution of the clus-
ters In this paper we focus on a specic aspect of the galactic tides
namely the secular adiabatic cosmological growth of galaxies and
neglect other effects at the expense of realism The full story of the
co-evolution of star clusters and their hosts would be told by con-
sidering a combination of this particular effect and the other mech-
anisms driving galaxy evolution like minor and major mergers and
the accretion of gas In that respect cosmological simulations and
merger trees would serve as a base to establish the relative weight
and frequency of these events and to allow us to build the true tidal
history of clusters in future studies
Here we follow the evolution of clusters in a time-dependent
galactic potential and compare to that in static potentials to quan-

ties of star clusters Our method is two-fold i an exploration of
the parameter space performed with very fast codes but at the price
of some simplications and ii several much slower but more ac-

2 METHODOLOGY
21 Time-evolving potential
For simplicity and to limit degeneracy in the results we only con-
sider the halo component of the galaxy and opt for a self-similar
growth The galaxy does not experience any merger event but
slowly and smoothly grows in mass and radius with time Fur-
thermore the halo remains spherically symmetric and we neglect
dynamical friction We choose to make such simplications in or-
der to focus on the role of a single physical process namely the
adiabatic cosmological growth

2014 who tted the evolution of halo parameters using the
Aquarius simulation Springel et al 2008 Namely the mass-scale
and scale-length of the halo evolve with redshift z as

that of the Milky Way-like halo labelled Aq-E-4 in Buist  Helmi

To evaluate the paramaters of the potential during the simula-
tion of the cluster we convert the time t since the beginning of the
simulation ie the age of cluster into redshift using

m cid1913cid26sinhcid20t  t0
3H01  m
cid21cid2723
which follows from equation 1320 of Peebles 1993 t0 represents
the age of the Universe when the simulation is started We adopt
the values of the cosmological constants m  031 and H0 
68 km s1 Mpc1 Planck Collaboration et al 2014 such that the
Hubble time equals 137 Gyr
We start our study at redshift 5 which leads to t0 
1169 Myr and we consider
the evolution of clusters over
1256 Gyr corresponding to the time difference between z  5
and z  0 We choose the present day z  0 values of the
mass-scale and scale-length to be Ms0  15  1011 M and
Rs0  16 kpc Fig 1 shows the evolution of the mass-scale Ms
and scale-length Rs both normalised to their values at z  0

their value at z  0 ie for t  126 Gyr t  0 corresponds to the start
of the simulations ie z  5
22 Galaxies
Our study of the effects of time-varying potentials on the evolution
of star cluster comprises three types of tidal histories
 S5 static z  5 the cluster evolves in a static version of the
potential of Equation 2 with properties corresponding to z  5
Equation 1 provides the corresponding galactic mass scale and
scale radius  55  1010 M and  97 kpc
 TD time dependent the initial setup is strictly the same as
for S5 but the potential evolves with redshift from z  5 to z  0
as described in the previous Section
 S0 static z  0 the cluster reaches the exact same nal
orbital position and velocity than in TD but has evolved in a static
potential with properties for z  0 In practice we compute the
nal position and velocity of the cluster from TD when z  0
has been reached We then freeze the potential and perform a
backward integration of the cluster orbit This gives us the initial
position and velocity of the cluster for the S0 run
Therefore by setting one initial position and velocity for a
cluster in the S5 galaxy we uniquely dene three orbits and the
associated three tidal histories S5 TD and S0
For simplicity we always initially set the cluster at apocen-
ter with a purely tangential velocity in our S5 and TD cases
integration is performed using the NBODY6tt method
Renaud  Gieles 2015 either to integrate the motion of the clus-
ter Section 3 or in the full N-body context where the cluster is
described star-by-star Section 4
23 Star cluster ducial initial conditions
We considered several intrinsic and orbital initial conditions for
the clusters Unless otherwise mentioned our clusters are modeled
with 32768 stars distributed on a Plummer sphere with a virial ra-
dius of 3 pc ie a half-mass radius of  23 pc The masses of
the stars follow a Kroupa 2001 initial mass function from 01 to
1 M leading to a total initial mass of  103  104 M We do
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
not account for stellar evolution We explore other cases by varying
these parameters in the next Sections
3 PARAMETER SPACE EXPLORATION
We aim to determine if under which conditions and to what ex-
tend the evolution of a cluster in a cosmologically growing poten-
tial TD differs from that of the same cluster in a static z  0 ver-
sion of this potential S0 This difference relies on i the strength
of the tidal eld and ii how sensitive the cluster is to tides
31 Quantifying the tidal eld
We rst seek an estimate of the galactic disruptive effect on star
clusters Such effect comprises contributions of gravitational iner-
tial and orbital origin non-inertial For non-circular orbits non-
inertial effects like the centrifugal force do not yield an analytical
expression However we can estimate their contributions by con-
sidering that the orbit is instantaneously circular ie by neglecting
the Coriolis and Euler effects and by computing the centrifugal ef-
fect using the instantaneous orbital angular frequency In this ide-
alised framework Renaud et al 2011 provides the expression of
the effective tidal tensor which encompasses both the gravitational
and centrifugal effects Using the expression of the galactic poten-
tial Equation 2 the main eigenvalue of the effective1 tidal tensor
er z

Rszcid19 
4r2  3rRsz
r  Rsz2 cid27 
This quantity represents the galactic effect along the galaxy-cluster
axis and can be used to estimate the tidal radius2 see Renaud et al
2011 for details
We show an example of evolution of the effective eigenvalue
in Fig 2 together with the galactocentric radius and the galactic
mass enclosed in this radius for the three orbits TD S5 and S0
As constructed the TD case evolves from the S5 to the S0 setup
On average despite of a smaller orbital radius the mass enclosed
within the galactocentric radius in S0 is larger than that in S5 be-
cause the S0 galaxy yields a higher total mass We estimate the
mean tidal strength over an orbit by computing the time-average
hei of the main effective eigenvalue over an orbital period dashed
lines on Fig 2 This quantity is constant in static potentials The
larger enclosed mass and smaller galactocentric distance result in a
stronger tidal effect along the S0 orbit than in the S5 case
The secular cosmological galactic growth can only affect the
evolution of star clusters if the tidal effects in the S5 and S0 case
Secular galactic growth on star clusters
Figure 3 Relative strength of the tidal eld between the S0 and S5 cases
as a function of initial galactocentric radius rS5t  0 and orbital ec-
centricity in the S5 case see text for details The difference between tidal
strengths is maximal for circular orbits in the outer region of the halo
are signicantly different or in other words if the ratio
heS0i
heS5i
is large with respect to unity This ratio depends on the initial posi-
tion and velocity of the cluster in a non-trivial way By varying the
initial galactocentric radius and orbital eccentricity of the cluster
for the S5 orbit and integrating it numerically we obtain the map
of the ratio of tidal strengths shown in Fig 3 Recall from Sec-
tion 22 that setting the initial position and velocity for S5 uniquely
denes the initial position and velocity for S0
The largest differences between the tidal elds of the redshift
5 and 0 galaxies are found in the outer regions of the galactic
halo and for circular orbits Secular galactic growth induces the
largest differences in the outer regions of galactic halos and thus
the largest differences in tides are found along orbits that remain in
such regions for the largest fraction of their period
However at large galactocentric distance tidal forces are
weak and only have a mild impact on the evolution of clusters
The differences found between the S5 and S0 cases might thus not
translate into differences in the properties of the clusters
To summarise we have identied the orbits favouring the
largest differences in tides between high and low redshift but the
resistance of clusters to tidal harassment must also be considered
before concluding on the effect of secular galactic growth on star
clusters

ing the centrifugal effect is

2 In the textbook context of circular orbits around point-masses using the
effective eigenvalue leads to the denition of the tidal radius of King 1962
or Binney  Tremaine 2008 while the purely gravitational eigenvalue
corresponds to the denition of Spitzer 1987
32 Cluster sensitivity to tidal harassment
We have seen in the previous Section that the average strength of
the tidal eld experienced by a cluster could increase by a factor
of a few because of the secular cosmological growth of the galaxy
We focus here on star cluster responses to such differences
One of the most accurate manner to study star cluster evo-
lution is through N-body simulations These are however very
numerically costly and such approach forbids an exploration of

lution relies on an handful of coupled differential equations
see eg Ambartsumian 1938 Chandrasekhar 1942 King 1958
Henon 1961 Heggie 1975 Hut et al 1992 Lee  Ostriker 1987
Gieles et al 2011 The code EMACSS Alexander  Gieles 2012
Gieles et al 2014 Alexander et al 2014 solves these equations
numerically and provides an easy and very fast way to evaluate
the properties of the cluster along its evolution
We rst setup our ducial cluster Section 23 in EMACSS
using the tidal eld strengths computed in the previous Section
To model the tidal effect we determine the mass of the point-
mass galaxy that would lead to the same average effective eigen-
value hei than our NFW halos at a given orbital radius Do-
ing this allows us to set the same tidal radii in EMACSS than the
time-average ones measured in the previous Section However we
neglect the differences between the shape of the potentials see
Tanikawa  Fukushige 2010 for a discussion on that matter This
assumption will be validated later
Fig 4 shows the ratio between the nal cluster mass when
embedded in the S0 and S5 tides Despite the differences in tidal
strengths found in Fig 3 the differences in the nal mass of the
cluster remain below 10 percent in all cases In other words the
nal mass of our ducial cluster is almost the same in S5 and S0
for all initial orbital radii and eccentricities considered
To extend this conclusion we apply the same method to clus-
ters with different sensitivity to tides by varying the initial half-
mass radius and thus indirectly the Roche-lling factor the ratio
between the cluster half-mass radius and the tidal radius We plot
in Fig 5 the ratios of the nal masses as in Fig 4 and nal half-
mass radii We arbitrarily choose the tidal eld strength of orbits
with an eccentric of 03 but reach the same conclusion of other
Figure 4 Ratio of the nal cluster mass computed with EMACSS see text
when evolved in the S0 and S5 potentials as a function of initial galac-
tocentric radius and orbital eccentricity in the S5 case The cluster initial
parameters are those of the ducial case Note that EMACSS is not designed
to treat orbits with a high Roche lling factor and thus the cases within the
central 5 kpc are not considered here
values as already suggested by the independence to eccentricity
showed in Fig 4 In all cases explored the properties of the cluster
mass size along the S5 orbit lie within less than a few percent
from those along the S0 orbit
Because the TD case represents a slow and smooth transition
between S5 and S0 the differences between the latter can be seen
as an upper limit of the expected differences between the time-

full N-body simulations We use the method and implementa-
tion NBODY6tt presented in Renaud  Gieles 2015 based on
NBODY6 Aarseth 2003 Nitadori  Aarseth 2012 The method re-
lies on a description of the galactic potential through a numerical
routine as a function of position and time Using this denition
the code integrates the motion of the cluster around the galaxy and
adds tidal acceleration to the internal acceleration for all stars We
have dened the galactic potentials and their time-dependence ex-
actly as describe in Section 21 and performed several sets of S5
TD and S0 runs
41 Cluster structure
Fig 6 shows the evolution of the mass and some Lagrange radii
of our ducial cluster Section 23 set at an initial position of
20 kpc with an orbital eccentricity of 03 as in Fig 2 As expected
from the parameter space exploration presented above black dot
in Fig 5 the relative difference in nal mass respectively half-
mass radius between the S5 and S0 runs is very small  61 per-
cent respectively  4 percent The excellent agreement between
the NBODY6tt results and EMACSS validates our assumptions at
least in this region of the parameter space We have also tested this
agreement by considering other eccentricities 0 05 and 07 not
shown here and reached the same conclusions As foreseen in the
previous Section the difference between the S0 and TD runs is
even smaller  26 percent for the mass and  3 percent for the
half-mass radius than that between the S5 and S0 cases
We also run other NBODY6tt models corresponding to the
black triangles on Fig 5 and reach the same conclusions both on
the validity of our method and on the physical results obtained

dependent TD and static S0 cases Since this upper limit is very
small we expect clusters with a time-dependent tidal history to
share very similar properties as those in static potentials In other
words cluster evolution should be fairly independent of the evolu-
tion of its host galaxy for the secular growth considered here
4 N-BODY SIMULATIONS
When performing the exploration of the parameter space described
in the previous Section we made the assumption that the time-
average tidal strength can be used to infer the galactic inuence on
star clusters While this is perfectly valid for circular orbits it is not
for eccentric cases Baumgardt  Makino 2003 Webb et al 2014
An analytical description of tidal effects for non-circular orbit is yet
to be established Furthermore we have neglected the second order
effect of the detailed shape of the tidal eld when assuming the
tidal radius is a good representation of the tidal strength
To test these assumptions and validate our conclusions we
select a few cases from our parameter space study and perform

42 Tidal tails
Tidal ejection of stars from clusters leads to the formation of tidal
tails Although we have found that the mass loss rate of clusters
appear to be independent of tidal history in the context of secular
growth tidal tails could respond differently to a time-dependent
and a static galactic potential
Fig 7 shows the position of all the stars cluster and tails and
Fig 8 displays the distribution of mean galactocentric distance and
the mass in galatic azimuth bins of width 1 for the clusters hav-
ing experienced the TD and S0 tidal histories Differences between
the models appear at rather large distance from the cluster center
The differences in mass are of the order of a few solar masses ie
concern only an handful of stars
Despite different tidal histories over the 126 Gyr of evolution
we considered the nal position density length and distribution of
substructures in the tidal tails between the TD and S0 models are
almost undistinguishable In other words clusters and their tidal
debris do not retain signatures of the tidal history they experienced
5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We study the evolution of star clusters embedded in cosmologically
growing galaxies and focus on the secular adiabatic growth of dark
matter halos neglecting impulsive and transient events like galaxy
mergers Our main ndings are
 Although the typical tidal elds associated with high and low
redshift halos can vary by a factor of several these variations do
not translate into major differences in the properties of star clusters
embedded in those elds
 Because of these similarities the details on the secular evolu-
tion of the halo growth rate growth epoch have a negligible effect
on the present-day properties of the clusters
 Present-day star clusters that co-evolved with their host galaxy
yield the same properties as if they had evolved in a static halo
Clusters orbiting in the innermost regions of galaxies are af-
fected by the tidal effect from the baryonic components that we
have neglected Among other effects the details on the formation
of thin and thick discs could modify the role of disc shocking in the
evolution of clusters Spitzer 1958 and alter our conclusions We
still understand too little on galaxy and structure formation to reach
conclusion on this matter
Furthermore we only considered spherically symmetric ha-
los ie neglecting time-dependent anisotropy and substructures
Although we expect these aspects to rarely be of signicant impor-
tance for star clusters Bonaca et al 2014 showed that could alter
the morphology of tidal debris
Our conclusions depend on the growth history of the galaxy
mainly when and how fast the bulk of the growth takes place Cos-
mological simulations indicate that most of the adiabatic growth
happens at high redshift recall Fig 1 see Buist  Helmi 2014
which has a very mild effect on star clusters as we have shown A
galaxy can also experience a signicant growth in the form of a vio-
lent event If so the growth enters the impulsive regime and can be
seen a galaxy merger The response of the clusters to such event is
non-negligible but complex as showed in Renaud  Gieles 2013
The real evolution of a galaxy and of its clusters lies in between
these two extremes Our study demonstrates that the main impacts
of galactic tides on star clusters in the cosmological context are the
impulsive events and not the adiabatic growth
In the context of the Milky-Way the absence of evidence for
recent major mergers in the last  6  9 Gyr Deason et al 2013
andor since the formation of the disc Ruchti et al 2014 makes
our results directly applicable to clusters formed in-situ Studies of
such clusters can thus safely make the assumption that the galac-
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
tic potential has been static over several Gyr without biasing the
conclusions on the mass- and size-functions of the clusters Stud-
ies that consider globular cluster population evolution in a static
Milky Way potential showed that it is not possible within a Hubble
time to evolve an initial cluster mass function with a power-law
shape and an index of -2 as found for young massive cluster today
Portegies Zwart et al 2010 into a mass function that is peaked at a
universal mass of  2 105 M with secular dynamical evolution
Baumgardt 1998 Vesperini 2001 Gieles  Baumgardt 2008 Our
results support this conclusion Note however that this is not valid
when considering the non-negligible fraction of clusters of external
origin which have been accreted from dwarf satellite galaxies onto
the Milky Way Marn-Franch et al 2009 Leaman et al 2013
The diversity of scenarios of galaxy evolution seen in cos-
mological simulations implies that present-day star clusters have
experienced a wide variety of tidal histories By decomposing
these scenarios into individual processes and events like ma-
jor mergers Renaud  Gieles 2013 accretion of dwarf satellites
Bianchini et al 2015 secular growth this work and others and
by understanding their relative roles on the evolution of clusters
we will soon able to seek and identify specic imprints of galaxy
evolution on the observed properties of star clusters
