ABSTRACT
Phenomenological models for evolution of dusty galaxies and ES0 galaxies
respectively are developed to address two major questions concenring galaxy pop-
ulations in deep infrared IR surveys 1 Do normal late-type galaxies or star-
burst galaxies including galaxies with obscured AGNs dominate among sources
in deep IR surveys 2 How much do ES0 galaxies contribute to the counts in
deep mid-infrared MIR 3  20m surveys Among three new models for evo-
lution of dusty galaxies it is assumed in Model S1 that starburst galaxies are the
dominant population and in Model S2 that normal galaxies dominate Model S3
is an intermediate model Comparing the model predictions with a wide range
of observational data collected from the literature we nd that none of these
models can be ruled out given the uncertainties of the data We show that the
most direct method to distinguish these models is to compare the predicted color
distributions of IR galaxies with observations which will soon be available from
the SWIRE survey The models for ES0 galaxies follow a simple passive evolu-
tion approach Among the three ES0 models E1 E2 and E3 investigated in
this paper Model E2 which is specied by a peak formation redshift zpeak  2
and an e-folding formation time scale   2 Gyr ts the data best This sug-
gests a synchronization between the evolution of ES0 galaxies and of starburst
galaxies in the sense that the peak of the formation function of ES0s zpeak  2
is close to the peak of the evolution functions of starburst galaxies zpeak  14
We nd that ES0s contribute about 10  30 of the counts in the MIR bands
of  10m and up to 30  50 of the opticalNIR counts in the bright end
Their contributions to counts in the UV 2000A and in the longer wavelength
IR  12m bands are negligible Taking into account this contribution new
predictions for counts and confusion limits in the SIRTF bands are presented

Introduction
Many new windows have recently been opened in various wavebands for observations
of high redshift galaxies Particularly deep ISO surveys eg Rowan-Robinson et al 1997
Franceschini et al 1997 Kawara et al 1998 Elbaz et al 1999 Aussel et al 1999 Flores
et al 1999b Puget et al 1999 Dole et al 2001 Clements et al 1999 Serjeant et al 2000
in the infrared and SCUBA surveys Hughes et al 1998 Barger et al 1998 Blain et al
1999 in the submm wavebands have shed lights on the dark side of galaxy formation and
evolution This stimulated a surging wave of empirical models Xu et al 1998 Blain et
al 1999 Roche  Eales 1999 Dole et al 2001 Xu 2000 Rowan-Robinson 2001 Xu et al
2001 Franceschini et al 2001 Pearson 2001 Malkan  Stecker 2001 Chary  Elbaz 2001
to interpret the new ISO and SCUBA sources The main aim of these empirical models is
to better constrain some important characteristics of the galaxy evolution including the
peak epoch of the star formation rate in the universe and the roles played by dierent star
formation modes eg the quiescent mode against the interaction stimulated mode for
which the earlier optical deep surveys such as the Hubble Deep Field Survey Williams et
al 1996 may have provided biased information Madau et al 1996 by neglecting the dust
extinction Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 Lonsdale 1999 This will certainly have impact
on the theoretical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution which eg Somerville et
al 2001 have just started facing the fact that most of the early star formation may be
hidden behind a thick veil of dust making the incorporation of eects of dust extinction
and emission in the framework essential Granato et al 2000
Some of the most recent empirical models Rowan-Robinson 2001 Xu et al 2001
 4 
Franceschini et al 2001 Pearson 2001 Chary  Elbaz 2001 have the feature that they can
be constrained by counts and the cosmic background radiation in various IR and submm
bands simultaneously This is achieved by using SED templates to link sources in dierent
bands The SED library of Xu et al 2001 contains realistic SEDs of a complete sample of
837 IRAS 25m selected galaxies enabling prediction of counts as well as color distributions
which provide additional constraints to the model Templates in Rowan-Robinson 2001
Xu et al 2001 and Chary  Elbaz 2001 extend from the IR-submm to optical and
UV wavebands hence these models can predict also the contributions from IR sources to
optical and UV counts relating the evolution of IR sources to that of galaxies seen in earlier
optical and UV surveys All of these works found strong evolution among IR sources in the
redshift range of 0  z  15 Assuming that the narrow sub-mJy bump on the Euclidian
normalized dierential counts of ISOCAM 15m surveys Elbaz et al 1999 is due to the
K-corrections caused by the strong unidentied broad band emission features UIB at 6 
8m which are shifted into the ISOCAM 15m band lter LW3 when z  1 Xu 2000
concluded that typical IR galaxies at z  1 have L15m  1011 L namely about 20 times
more luminous than their local counterparts while their comoving density is about the
same as their local counterparts As argued by Xu et al 2001 the location of the 15m
bump f15m  04mJy provides a strong constraint on the luminosities of IR sources at
z  1 This has been conrmed by the detailed study of ISOCAM sources in the HDF-north
by Elbaz et al 2002 who obtained redshifts for nearly all of these sources 40 out of total
41 The strong evolution has also been supported by surveys in other ISOCAM bands
For example Clements et al 2001 found that the luminosity functions of their ISO 12m
sources are consistent with a pure luminosity evolution of rate  1  z45 as derived by
Xu 2000 from the ISOCAM 15m counts
On the other hand dierent authors identied dierent populations of galaxies as
the major carriers of the evolution of IR sources It was found in early IRAS studies
 5 
Franceschini et al 1988 Rowan-Robinson  Crawford 1989 that IR sources can be divided
into 3 dierent populations normal late-type galaxies cirrus galaxies starburst galaxies
and galaxies with AGNs Assuming that all IR sources undergo pure luminosity evolution
with the same evolution rate Rowan-Robinson 2001 found that cirrus galaxies dominate
the ISOCAM 15m counts the SCUBA 850m counts and the cosmic IR background
radiation Xu et al 2001 motivated by results of optical identications of ISO galaxies
by Flores et al 1999b and Aussel et al 1999 which show a larger percentage of these
sources are in interacting systems assumed that most of the evolution of the IR sources
is due to starburst galaxies dened by warm FIR colors f60mf100m  05 Obscured
AGNs with relatively low f25mf60m ratios due to the very high extinction aecting
even the MIR uxes may be misclassied as starbursts in Xu et al 2001 who classied
galaxies with AGNs using the criterion f25mf60m  02 Franceschini et al 2001 also
assumed that the strong evolution is conned to the starburst population Their starburst
galaxies include all active galaxies not classied as Sey 1 ie
including the Sey 2s and
the LINERs in Rush et al 1993 Pearson 2001 found that a separate population
of ultra-luminous galaxies ULIRGs with L 1012L conned in a very narrow range
of redshift centered at z  1 is mostly responsible for the strong evolution seen in the
ISOCAM 15m counts Since all these models can t the IR-submm counts and the CIB
within uncertainty limits there is apparently a degeneracy concerning the population of
galaxies that carry most of the evolution of IR sources The degeneracy still remains even
when the new detailed information of the 15 micron universe source counts redshift
distributions luminosity functions at dierent redshifts etc Elbaz et al 2002 Franceschini
et al 2001 is considered see Section 2
One of the central issues in the current agenda of hierarchical galaxy formation
simulation studies concerns the roles played by two dierent star formation modes eg
Somerville et al 2001 Kaumann et al 2001 namely the quiescent star formation mode
 6 
and the interaction-induced star formation mode There are apparent links between the
normal quiescent galaxies and the quiescent star formation as in the Milky Way and
M31 and between starburst galaxies and the interaction-induced star formation as in the
Antennae Galaxies and in M82 Therefore the answer to the question whether the normal
galaxies or starburst galaxies dominate the faint IR counts will have important impact on
galaxy evolution theories
Another deciency of the current models for IR sources is the neglection of early type
galaxies Although these galaxies have little dust emission therefore do not contribute
signicantly to IR counts at wavelengths longer than  10m they are found as an
important population in ISO 67m counts Flores et al 1999b Aussel et al 1999 Serjeant
et al 2000 Future mid-IR surveys such as those planned for SIRTF IRAC cameras 4
bands centered at 36m 45m 58m and 8m respectively will certainly detect many
of these galaxies
In this paper we shall address the above two issues namely 1 developing new models
to investigate how to break the degeneracy concerning the major evolution population
in IR counts using SIRTF data in particular and 2 modeling the evolution of ES0
galaxies and predicting their contributions to the MIR counts The plan of the paper is
as follows in Section 2 a set of new models for evolution of dusty galaxies are presented
while in Section 3 models for evolution of ES0 galaxies are developed and compared to
the observations predictions for the UV optical and NIR counts by a set of composite
models each consisting of a dusty galaxy evolution model and an ES0 evolution model are
presented and compared with data in Section 4 The predictions for counts and confusion
limits in SIRTF bands by the same models are presented in Section 5 In Section 6 we
show how to use color distributions of ISO sources and future SIRTF sources to answer
the question whether starburst galaxies or normal late-type galaxies are dominant in the
 7 
IR sources Section 7 is devoted to discussion A summary is given in Section 81 The

2 New Models for Evolution of Dusty Galaxies
21 Previous Models
In all the multi-band models for the evolution of dusty galaxies in the literature
the dierent populations of galaxies are separated by their characteristic spectral energy
distributions SEDs the normal galaxies have relatively low f60mf100m and f25mf12m
ratios and very prominent UIB features the starburst galaxies have relatively high
f60mf100m and f25mf12m ratios and less prominent UIB features over a steep rising
MIR continuum and galaxies with AGNs have relatively high f25mf60m ratios and very
week UIB contributed by ISM dust not associated with the AGN Models by Xu et al
2001 have also considered the luminosity dependence of the SED in each population while
some other models Rowan-Robinson 20001 Franceschini et al 2001 Pearson 2001 Chary
 Elbaz 2001 separate high luminosity starbursts Arp220 type from moderate luminosity
starbursts M82 type Because of their dierent SEDs these dierent populations of
galaxies give dierent relative contributions to counts at dierent wavelengths However
it appears that the counts are rather loose constraints to these relative contributions At
least 2 factors are responsible for this degeneracy 1 there are many parameters in the
evolution functions both the luminosity evolution and the density evolution when dierent
populations are allowed to evolve dierently and 2 there are still signicant uncertainties

in the current ISO counts eg counts of the same ELAIS 15m sources reported by
Serjeant et al 2000 and by Gruppioni et al 2002 dier with each other by as much as a
factor of 3 due both to calibration errors and the eld-to-eld variation In principle the
degeneracy can be broken by comparing model predictions on redshift distributions of deep
FIR  
 60m selected samples with observations Models assuming warmer IR SEDs
starbursts dominant usually predict larger mean redshifts than models assuming cooler
IR SEDs normal-galaxies dominant do However similar to the SCUBA galaxies the
large beams of FIR detectors such as the ISOPHOT cameras make it rather dicult to
pin-down the optical counterparts usually quite faint of faint FIR sources
A more direct method to constrain the relative contributions of dierent populations
to the IR counts is to compare the predicted and observed color distributions of IR sources
Among the multi-band models for evolution of dusty galaxies in the literature those of Xu
et al 2001 have the most sophisticated algorithm in dealing with the SEDs and are the
only ones that can predict both the mean colors and their dispersions Therefore we choose
to build our new models using the same algorithm as Xu et al 2001
22 New Models
In the new models the simulation code of Xu et al 2001 is modied in the following
aspects
1 The luminosity and density evolution functions for the starburst galaxies and normal
late-tpye galaxies respectively have the following new form
Fiz  1  zui  1  1  z1  z11  11  z1viui 
1  11  z21  1  z1  z2viwi z  7
 9 
Giz  1  zpi  1  1  z1  z11  11  z1qipi 
1  11  z21  1  z1  z2qiri z  7
These smoothly-joined 3-piece power laws in contrast with the sharply-joined 2-piece
power laws used in Xu et al 2001 will allow softening in the low redshift end
z  05 of the evolution functions to improve the t to the redshift distribution of
IRAS 60m sources
2 The 25m local luminosity functions LLF of 3 populations used in Xu et al 2001
did not themselves take into account of the evolutionary eects In the new models
new 25m LLFs corrected for these eects are used see Appendix A for the details
of the new LLFs It is found that these new LLFs are only marginally dierent from
the old ones
3 The UV portion   3000A of the SEDs in the SED lib which is an important part
of the code is better constrained in this work Appendix B
Given the large number of parameters it is out the scope of this paper to explore the
entire parameter space for models allowed by available data Instead we concentrate on
three models which predict very dierent relative contributions by starburst galaxies and
normal late-type galaxies to the counts in the IR surveys For each of them parameters
have been ne-tuned so that the model can t all available data as well as possible These
models for dusty galaxies are presented in Table 1 and Fig1
Model S1 is similar to the models in Xu et al 2001 and in Franceschini et al 2001
in the sense that the starburst galaxies are assumed to dominate the evolution of the IR
sources In Model S2 similar to Rowan-Robinson 2001 all three populations of dusty
galaxies are assumed to have pure luminosity evolution with the same evolution rate This
 10 
is actually the same evolutionary scenario adopted by Xu 2000 who assumed that the
entire body of IR sources evolve as a single population Note Rowan-Robinson 2001
assumes that there is no SED evolution while in Model S2 we assume SEDs evolving with
luminosity In Model S3 it is assumed that the normal galaxies and starburst galaxies
give about equal contributions to the ISOCAM 15m counts as hinted at by the optical
identications of ISO sources Flores et al 1999b Aussel et al 1999 For Model S1 and
Model S3 the luminosity evolution function of galaxies with AGNs is adopted from the
optical QSO luminosity evolution function of Boyle et al 2000
FAGN z  10136z027z2
z  7
This is slightly dierent from the power law function used in Xu et al 2001

23 Predictions for Counts and Redshift Distributions
In Fig2 Fig3 and Fig4 predictions by these 3 models for the 15m 60m 90m
170m 850m counts and for the CIB are compared with the data 2 respectively The
data points are taken from a large pool of measurements found in the literature which is
still evolving rapidly This is particularly true for the measurements involving ISO data
because more and more new data reduction tools are becoming available for these rather
complex data
Model S1 which is otherwise same as the peak model in Xu et al 2001 except for
the modications listed in Section 22 predicts that the contribution from the starburst
population dominates almost everywhere in these plots The model predictions are in
reasonably good agreements with data in all plots given the large dispersions in the data
sets Particularly the new results of Gruppioni et al 2002 on the 15m counts of ELAIS
sources lled 4-point stars in plot are about a factor of 3 lower than the counts from
the same survey reported by Serjeant et al 2000 open 4-point stars and are also
signicantly lower than other ISOCAM measurements in the ux range of 1 mJy  f15m 
10 mJy Model S1 predicts a less prominent sub-mJy peak in the 15m counts than the
peak model of Xu et al 2001 because the sharp peak at z15 in the evolution functions
of the old model is replaced by a smooth peak in the new model at z  13 see Fig1 It
is worth to note that in the bright end of the SCUBA counts f850m
 5mJy the model
predicts that the contribution from galaxies with AGN exceeds that from starbursts This
result seems to be consistent with the limited knowledge we have about the bright SCUBA
2The units used in the plots throughout this paper are rather heterogeneous This is
becuase many data points collected from the literature are measured from gures that used
dierent units Often it is dicult to convert them to the same units in particular for errors
 12 
sources out of the 7 SCUBA sources of f850m  8mJy in the sample of Smail et al 2002
4 show signs of AGN On the other hand the model predictions on the SCUBA 850m
counts are close to the lower boundary of the data
In contrast to Model S1 Model S2 predicts that for 15m counts 850m counts and
for the CIB the population of normal galaxies dominate Fig3 This is in agreement
with the results of Rowan-Robinson 2001 The same model predicts that normal galaxies
and starburst galaxies give about equal contributions to the 170m counts and starbursts
dominate the 90m and 60m counts This model can also t the data in all these plots
well Fig3
By design the contributions from normal galaxies and from starburst galaxies are
indeed nearly equal in the predictions of Model S3 for 15m counts Fig4 The same
model predicts that the 60m 90m and 170m counts are dominated by starbursts For
the SCUBA 850m band the model predicts comparable contributions from the normal
galaxies and from the starbursts to the counts in a wide ux range and the contribution
from AGNs dominant the counts at a few 10s of mJy level while being negligible at
sub-mJy level The CIB predicted by this model is dominated by the contribution from the
starbursts in the wavelength range 20m 
  
 300m and by that from normal galaxies
at other wavelengths
In Fig5 Fig6 and Fig7 predictions by the 3 models for the redshift distributions for
the IRAS 60m ISOCAM 15m ELAIS 90m FIRBACK 170m and SCUBA 850m
and future SWIRE 24m surveys are plotted The model predictions for the IRAS 60m
and ISOCAM 15m surveys are compared to the data All 3 models give more satisfactory
ts to redshift distribution of the IRAS 60m sources than the peak model favorite
model of Xu et al 2001 does though Model S1 still over-predicts the number of IRAS
60m sources with z  02 by about a factor of 3 For the redshift distribution of ISOCAM
 13 
15m sources in the HDF-north the predictions of the Model S1 gives the best t among
the 3 models although given the large error bars of the data the dierence among model
predictions is subtle
All the 3 models predict bi-modal redshift distributions for ELAIS 90m and
FIRBACK 170m sources with normal galaxies dominating the rst peak and starburst
galaxies dominating the second peak Model S1 predicts that most of ELAIS 90m and
FIRBACK 170m sources have z  05 In contrast Model S2 predicts that most of these
sources have z  05 being in the rst peak of the redshift distributions This dierence is
due to the so-called temperature-redshift degeneracy for infrared galaxies Blain 1999
In the long wavelength bands such as the 90m and the 170m the sources in Model S1
tend to have larger redshifts than those in Model S2 in order to compensate their warmer
IR SEDs Interestingly this indicates that we can break the degeneracy over these models
by comparing the predicted and observed redshift distributions of the ISOPHOT sources in
these bands Serjeant et al 2001 obtained high condence redshifts for 16 out of 37
sources of f90m  01Jy in the ELAIS S1 eld 396 deg2 none of them has redshift larger
than 05 This sets a lower limit of 4311 for the percentage of the 90m sources in this
eld to have z  05 Taken at the face value only the prediction of S2 53 is comfortably
above this lower limit while the prediction of S3 37 is marginally consistent with it and
the prediction of S1 30 is marginally below the limit The above comparisons seem to
favor Model S2 However given the fact that this data set was taken from a small region
and can be seriously aected by any clustering eect more observations are needed for any
denitive conclusions
Model S1 predicts a broad redshift distribution peaking between 2  z  3 for bright
SCUBA sources f850m  8 mJy broadly consistent with observational constraints Smail
et al 2002 Ivison et al 2002 Fox et al 2002 For the same sources Model S2 predicts a
 14 
prominent peak around z15 and less than 25 of sources at redshifts  2 not favored by
observations which in general suggest a mean redshift larger than 2 see eg Ivison et al
2002 Model S3 also predicts a peak around z15 for the f850m  8 mJy sources though
with a much wider high-redshift wing 44 of sources have z  2
24 Predictions for ISO LFs and SFH
The ISOCAM 15m sources in HDF-North have been thoroughly studied in the
literature Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 Aussel et al 1999 Elbaz et al 1999 Cohen et al
2000 Franceschini et al 2001 Elbaz et al 2002 All but 1 of a total of 41 sources with
f15m  01 mJy have spectroscopic redshifts Franceschini et al 2001 Elbaz et al 2002
Exploiting these redshifts we derived the 15m luminosity functions LFs in three redshift
intervals 04  z  07 07  z  1 and 1  z  13 using the classical Vmax method
These results are compared to the predictions of the three models in Fig8
Given the small size of the data set 40 galaxies it is understandable that the derived
luminosity functions have substantial uncertainties Particularly signicant uctuations
can be found in the redshift distributions Fig57 presumably due to clustering eects
Compared to these uncertainties the dierence in the predictions by the three dierent
models is again subtle They all lie near the lower ends of the error-bars Poisson error
of the two data points in the panel of 04  z  07 This is likely to be due to a bias in
the data caused by the over-density in the 04  z  06 bin Fig57 In the panels of
07  z  1 and 1  z  13 the predictions of Model S1 are slightly higher and t the
data slightly better than those of other two models
In Fig9a the star formation history SFH predicted by the three models are compared
to observations The red lower limits are derived from the ISOCAM 15m LFs Fig8
 15 
The lower limit of 15m luminosity density is derived by summing up the contributions in
the bins where the LF is actually measured ie no extrapolations are applied to measured
LFs then converted to total IR luminosity using the formula Lir  111  L15m Elbaz et
al 2002 The star formation rate is then estimated from the IR luminosity density using
the formula of Kennicutt 1998 SFR M yr1Lir  17 1010 L The predictions of
the three models are very close to each other within 50
In Fig9b Fig9c and Fig9d these predictions are broken into contributions by dierent
populations Indeed Model S1 predicts that except for in the low z end z 
 02 the
starburst galaxies overwhelmingly dominate the star formation in the universe Model S2
predicts just the opposite the star formation in the universe has been always dominated
by normal late-type galaxies while in Model S3 the contributions of these two populations
are more comparable All three models predict minor contributions from galaxies with
AGNs Note that since some of the IR emission from galaxies with AGNs is powered by
the gravitational energy released in the AGN not by star formation the model predictions
plotted here should be treated as upper limits
In the literature the steep decline of the star formation rate since z  1 has been well
established since early works of Lilly et al 1996 and Madau et al 1996 However
it is still controversial on what happened to the star formation rate in earlier universe
particularly before z  2 Most information on this issue is obtained from observations of
Lyman-Break galaxies LBGs Steidel et al 1999 However the extinction correction for
these rest-frame UV selected galaxies is very uncertain In addition many high redshift
star-forming galaxies may be completely missed in the surveys of LBGs because of heavy
extinction causing systematic underestimation when using LBGs to determine the star
formation rate in high z universe see eg Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 In this respect
the predictions of our models follow closely the data points determined from LBG surveys
 16 
after the extinction correction Steidel et al 1999 As discussed in Xu et al 2001 the
evolution of IR galaxies at redshifts  2 is mainly constrained by the sub-mm data in
the SCUBA surveys and in the CIB observations due to the negative K-correction Too
much star formation in those large redshifts will result in too many sub-mm counts and
too high sub-mm background radiation In the literature other models eg Gispert et
al 2000 Rowan-Robinson 2000 Chary  Elbaz 2001 which also invoked sub-mm data
to constrain the evolution of z  2 IR galaxies found the similar trend a peak at z  1
and a shallowat slope in z 
 2 in the SFR evolution The claim that the universal star
formation rate increases monotonically with redshift to very high z  
 7 by Lanzetta et
al 2002 is not supported by our and other studies on evolution of IR galaxies
3 Passive Evolution Models for ES0 Galaxies
The models follow a simple passive evolution approach Pozzetti et al 1996 The
basic assumption is that there has been no star formation in an ES0 galaxy since its
initial formation Consequently its radiation in dierent bands ie the SED and the LM
ratio evolves passively with the ever-aging stellar population Instead of assuming that all
ES0s formed at once together as in the classical monolithic galaxy formation scenario
the ES0 galaxies are assumed to form in a broad redshift range Franceschini et al 1998
specied by a truncated Gaussian function The SEDs of dierent ages are calculated using
the GRASIL code of Silva et al 1998 No dust emission is considered in these models
31 Evolution Function
The evolution function M t specifying how many ES0s are formed in a unit
volume in a unit time interval and in a unit mass interval is assumed to have the following
 17 
M t  M T t
where the time dependence function T t is a truncated Gaussian
T t  expt  tzpeak22
t  tz0
t  tz0
In this prescription for the sake of simplicity the time dependence is assumed to be
independent of the mass This implies that ES0s of dierent mass have the same formation
history ie no dierential evolution The time dependence function T t is fully dened
by 3 free parameters the peak formation time tzpeak the time scale  in Gyr and the
time when the formation of ES0s started tz0
Accordingly for a given redshift z the number of ES0s in a unit mass interval and a
unit volume can be found from the following integration
M z  M Z tz
T t dt
If the local mass function M z  0 is known then the mass dependence function
M can be derived
M 
where tz  0 is the current age of the universe
M z  0
R tz0
tz0 T t dt
In this work the local mass function is constrained using the local K-band luminosity
function of Kochanek et al 2001 and the LKM ratio predicted by GRASIL code Silva
et al 1999

32 Galaxy Age Distribution and SED Assignment
Eq6 predicts galaxy number for a given redshift in a unit mass interval and a unit
volume These galaxies have dierent ages spanning between   0 and   tz  tz0
The age distribution function Gz   is also a truncated Gaussian
Gz    G0 exptz    tzpeak22
0    tz  tz0
otherwise
For every galaxy simulated an age is assigned to it according to the above distribution
ie probability function According to the passive evolution model galaxies of dierent
ages have dierent SEDs and dierent LM ratios The SEDs of dierent ages are calculated
using GRASIL Silva et al 1998 Again for the sake of simplicity we assume a simple
single-burst scenario in analogy to the merger scenario of ES0 formation as hinted
at in the studies of ULIRGs Kormendy  Sanders 1992 to model the formation of
ES0s Namely we assume that all the stars in an ES0 galaxy were formed in a short
burst lasting 108 yrs after which all the ISM was blown out Accordingly the following
parameters are adopted for the input of GRASIL twin  01 Gyr ksch  10 sch  200
and inf  001 Then in the simulation of ES0s we include only sources older than 1
Gyrs Here we implicitly assume that merger remnants younger than 1 Gyr do not look like
ES0s because these systems may have not fully relaxed Namely they should be classied
as post-starbursts or EAs not ES0s Optical follow-up observations of ISOCAM sources
Flores et al 1999b Aussel et al 1999 Cohen et al 2000 Elbaz et al 2002 have shown
that EA galaxies are IR bright and have similar IR properties as active starburst galaxies

33 Three Models for ES0 Evolution
We consider 3 dierent ES0 models in this paper specied by dierent zpeak and
 Table 2 Fig10 Model E1 zpeak  5   05 Gyr mimics the classical monolithic
scenario Eggen et al 1962 Model E2 assumes a later and broader ES0 formation epoch
zpeak  2   2 Gyr Model E3 zpeak  1   3 Gyr assumes that most of ES0s are
formed at z  1 as hierarchical galaxy formation workers have advocated Kaumann et
al 1993 Kaumann  Charlot 1998
Table 2 Evolution models for ES0s
zpeak  Gyr
In Fig11 we compare the model predictions on the redshift dependence of opticalNIR
colors with the data from Franceschini et al 1998 Predictions of all three models can
t the overall trend of the data well On the other hand Model E1 predicts very little
scattering which is not conrmed by the data The other two models predict signicantly
larger dispersion in better agreement with the data
In Fig12 the redshift distribution of early type galaxies of Kab  2015 taken from
 20 
Franceschini et al 1998 is compared to the model predictions Note that only 15 out
of 35 redshifts in Franceschini et al 1998 are spectroscopically measured the rest are
photometric redshifts Among the three models Model E2 ts the data best It should be
noted that as discussed in Benitez et al 1999 and Rodighiero et al 2001 some high z
ES0s may have been missed in the Franceschini et al 1998 investigation
4 Counts in UV Optical NIR and MIR Bands
Both the ES0 galaxies and the dusty galaxies contribute signicantly in these bands
Since the three ES0 models predict almost identical counts dierence 
 01 dex in the
rest of the paper we shall present only the results from Model E2 zpeak  2   2 Gyr
In Fig13 Fig14 and Fig15 the contributions of ES0 galaxies to the counts in these
bands as predicted by Model E2 are added to the contributions of dusty galaxies as
predicted by Model S1 Model S2 and Model S3 respectively These model predictions
are compared to observations in the vacuum UV 2000A the B and R the NIR K and
the MIR 67m band ISOCAM and 12m IRAS and ISO CAM bands Between the
three gures the dierences in the total counts in the bands plotted are generally within
the uncertainties of data The model predictions can account for all counts in the R K
and MIR bands On the other hand the model predictions are signicantly lower than
the counts observed in the 2000A band Milliard et al 1994 For the B band the model
predictions are slightly lower  03 dex than the observed counts for B  20 mags These
results strongly hint at a population of star forming galaxies which are infrared quiet very
low dust attenuationemission therefore seen only in the UV and the blue bands see
Section 73 for more discussion
In the bright end of the K-band counts the prediction by S1E2 Fig13 is in good
 21 
agreement with the morphologically segregated counts reported by Huang et al 1998
namely at K 
 17 the ES0 galaxies contribute about 50 of the counts and at fainter
magnitudes the contribution from late-types becomes more and more dominant The
predictions by S2E2 and S3E2 on the ES0 contribution to K-band counts at K 16 are
 30 and  40 slightly less than the observational result of Huang et al 1998
The three models t the faint sub-mJy ISOCAM 67m counts very well However
predictions of S1E2 are about a factor of 3 lower than the ELAIS counts Serjeant et al
2000 at few mJy level For these counts predictions by S3E3 have the best agreement
with though being still about 50 less than the data It should be noted that as indicated
by the large discrepancy between the ELAIS 15m counts of Serjeant at al 2000 and of
Gruppioni et al 2002 the uncertainties of the ELAIS 67m counts of Serjeant et al
2000 may be signicantly larger than reported
The scatters of the ISOCAM 12m data Clements et al 1999 are large indicating
signicantly larger uncertainties than the Poisson noise error bars in the plot The three
brightest ISO points may suer serious biases caused by errors in galaxystar separation
Clements et al 1999 so are likely to be less reliable than other data points If this is
indeed the case then among the three models the predictions of S1E2 have the best
agreement with the data The eect of the Local Supercluster Lonsdale et al 1990 can
be seen in the bright IRAS 12m counts
5 Counts and Confusion Limits in SIRTF Bands
The ES0 galaxies contribute signicantly only to the four IRAC bands 36m 45m
58m and 8m while the 3 MIPS bands 24m 70m and 160m will see only dusty
galaxies
 22 
Model predictions of contributions by ES0 galaxies and by dierent populations of
dusty galaxies to the counts in three SIRTF bands 36m 24m and 70m bands are
plotted in Fig16 The total counts by the three dierent models are very close to each
other though the relative contributions from normal galaxies and from starbursts are very
dierent This can be understood by the fact that tuned to t the same counts in the ISO
bands which covers a wide wavelength range from 67m to 170m these models are forced
to be similar with each other
The 3- confusion limits are given in Table 3 for all 7 SIRTF bands These are
calculated by the method described in Xu et al 2001 and assuming that SIRTF 85
cm dish is diraction limited in all bands so the beams can be approximated by the
Airy function Since this idealized assumption may not be true particularly for the short
wavelength IRAC bands eg the 36m and 45m bands the results for those bands
should be treated as lower limits The confusion limits predicted by the 3 dierent models
dier by up to 80 The largest dierence occurs for the 70m band These dierences
reect the real uncertainties mostly due to the uncertainties in the ISO data which are the
major constraints to the models
Table 3 Confusion limits 3 of SIRTF bands
012 Jy 021 Jy 043 Jy 102 Jy 65 Jy 615 mJy 815 mJy
018 Jy 035 Jy 065 Jy 132 Jy 57 Jy 335 mJy 575 mJy
014 Jy 027 Jy 053 Jy 117 Jy 57 Jy 445 mJy 685 mJy

6 Colors as Model Discriminators for Dusty Galaxies
In empirical evolution models dierent populations of dusty galaxies are distinguished
by dierent SEDs Therefore the most direct method to distinguish models predicting
dierent dominant populations for IR sources is to compare the predicted color distributions
with the observations
In Fig17 we compare predictions of the three models for evolution of dusty galaxies
Table 1 for colors of ISO galaxies The detection limits are set to be f67m  30 Jy
f15m  100 Jy f90m  100 mJy f170m  180 mJy R  24 mag and K  20 mag
The predictions for f15mfR and f15mfK are compared to the data of ISOCAM 15m
sources in HDF-N Aussel et al 1999 Cohen et al 2000 Hogg et al 2000 It appears
that for ISO galaxies only the f15mfK color is a good model discriminator in the sense
that the peaks of the color distributions predicted by the three models are separated from
each other The data seem to favor Model S1 which predicts a peak in the f15mfK color
distribution right at the place where the data peaks However this data set is again too
small 30 galaxies and error bars too large to distinguish the three models
SWIRE3 a SIRTF Legacy Science program will survey 65 deg2 of sky in all 7 SIRTF
bands 36 45 58 8 24 70 and 160m down to a depth comparable to or even deeper
than that of ISOCAM 15m surveys The documented 5 sensitivity limits of SWIRE are
f36m  73 Jy f45m  87 Jy f58m  275 Jy f8m  325 Jy f24m  045 mJy
and f70m  275 mJy f160m  175 mJy Compared to predicted confusion limits in
Table 3 it appears that SWIRE surveys will be confusion limited in the the 70m and
160m bands Extensive ground based follow-up observations in the optical NIR and radio
bands will be carried out These survey areas will also be observed in the far-UV 1500A

and 2300A by GALEX4 in the deep survey mode In Fig18 model predictions for the
distributions of 6 colors of SWIRE galaxies are plotted These colors are selected among
many possible combinations to illustrate how the colors of SWIRE galaxies can discriminate
the models Model simulations of sky coverage of 5 deg2 are carried out For each plot the
samples of simulated sources are selected according to SWIREs sensitivity limits or for
the 70m and 160m bands the confusion limits Also it is required that R  24 mag and
K  20 mag when the R and K band data are invovled In four f70mf8m f24mf36m
f24mf8m and f24mfK of the six colors plotted the peaks of Model S1 starburst
dominant and Model S2 normals dominant are clearly separate Among these the peak
of the distribution predicted by Model 3 intermediate model is close to that of S1 in the
f70mf8m color plot close to that of S2 in the f24mf8m color plot and more ambiguous
in the other two plots Given the large sky coverage of SWIRE which is 13 times of what
is simulated here it is very hopeful that these color distributions will indeed provide clues
to the question of which population is dominant among IR sources
7 Discussion
71 Evolution of SEDs of Starburst Galaxies
As pointed out in Xu et al 2001 the most important assumption in our models
for the evolution of dusty galaxies is that high redshift ie z 
 1 star-forming galaxies
have the same SEDs as their local counterparts when the luminosity is the same Since
our SEDs cover from the UV all the way through to the radio waveband the validity
of this assumption demands similarity between high redshift and local galaxies in many
physical conditions a requirement that seems too strong to be fullled in the strict sense
4httpwwwsrlcaltechedugalex
 25 
Particularly the long term star formation history plays an important role in the optical and
NIR emission of galaxies and it is obvious that high redshift galaxies have very dierent
long term star formation history ie much younger than that of local galaxies Does this
mean that our predictions for the opticalNIR ux densities of high redshift dusty galaxies
are awed and therefore unreliable Our argument to dispute this suspicion is based on
the fact that high redshift galaxies particularly IR selected galaxies already detected
or to be detected in the future surveys are almost exclusively high luminousity galaxies
less luminous galaxies with high redshift are too faint to be detected As their local
counterparts these high redshift ULIRGs must host very powerful starbursts or AGNs as
energy sources which contribute much of the emission even in the NIR bands  40 for the
local ULIRGs Surace et al 2000 Scoville et al 2000 Therefore as far as the detectable
IR sources are concerned the dierence in the underlying old population between the
high redshift dusty starforming galaxies and their local counterparts does not aect very
seriously our model predictions
Recent multi-wavebands observations of SCUBA galaxies Smail et al 2002
Lyman-Break Galaxies Adelberger  Steidel 2000 and ISOCAM galaxies Flores et
al 1999a Aussel et al 1999 Cohen et al 2000 Elbaz et al 2002 are consistent
with our assumption that high redshift star-forming galaxies have similar SEDs as their
local counterparts particularly when binned according to the luminosity as stressed by
Adelberger  Steidel 2000 On the other hand some new observations hint at possible
systematic dierences between high redshift and local ULIRGs The HST image of SCUBA
galaxy SMM J140110252 Ivison et al 2001 shows that the star formation activity in
that source is widely spread up to a few kpc a situation remarkably dierent from typical
ULIRGs found in the local universe Sanders  Mirabel 1998 Compared to centrally
concentrated starbursts found in most of the local ULIRGs galaxies with such widely
distributed starbursts are expected to have less steep MIR slopes ie smaller f25mf12m
 26 
ratio and cooler FIR color ie larger f100mf60m ratios This is due to the less intense
radiation eld less warm dust emission in the 25m and 60m bands and less dust
opacity less extinction for MIR uxes Indeed Chapman et al 2002 found that two
sources detected both by the FIRBACK 170m band survey Puget et al 1999 Dole et
al 2001 and by SCUBA Scott et al 2000 one at z091 and the other at z046 have
signicantly cooler dust temperatures Tdust  30K compared to Tdust  50K found for
typical ULIRGs such as Arp220 They argue that this may indicate the starbursts in these
systems are also extended Given the small amount of information and the possible bias for
cooler galaxies due to the sub-mm selection Chapman et al 2002 it is still too early to
tell whether high-redshift ULIRGa are systematically more extended and therefore have
SEDs closer to less luminous local interacting galaxies such as the Antennae galaxies
which are in earlier stages along the merger sequence Future surveys like SWIRE will
address these questions
72 ES0 evolution and starburst evolution
Comparisons between predictions ES0 evolution models and observational data
Fig1112 indicate that the intermediate model Model E2 which assumes a peak
formation redshift of zpeak  2 is the favorite among the three models This is in agreement
with some previous works Franceschini et al 1998 Rodighiero et al 2001 Im et al
2002 This model can reproduce well the trend in the color-z plots and also t the
redshift distribution very well However particular in the B-K vs z plot the data show
signicantly larger dispersion than the model predictions There are two possible causes for
1 In our simple models we have assumed that all of the ES0s are formed through
the same starburst procedure which means their stellar populations have the same
 27 
metallicity It is known eg Worthy 1994 that local ES0s have dierent metallicity
which is a major cause of the dierent ML ratios and colors among these galaxies
Therefore by neglecting these eects our models leave some of the scatters in the
color distributions unaccounted for
2 Some of the blue ES0s in the data Franceschini et al 1998 may not be true ES0s
According to Im et al 2002 many of these blue interlopers have strong narrow
emission lines suggesting that they are low-mass starbursts rather than massive
star-forming ES0s
In fact there is still a lack of consensus in the denition of ES0s in deep surveys
Using a strict algorithm selecting the most symmetric and smooth galaxies Im et al
2002 found far less blue sources among their ES0 sample than eg Schade et al 1999
and Menanteau 1999 whose samples were selected with less strict algorithms A related
uncertainty in our models is the choice on the exclusion of galaxies younger than 1 Gyr
Section 32 This choice is not entirely arbitrary pushing the cut-o toward younger
ages means more galaxies with high LM ratios which in turn results in too high model
predictions for optical and NIR counts This shows that the question of where to put the
boundary between ES0s and post-starbursts deserves more investigation
If indeed ES0s are formed through mergers Toomre 1978 Kormendy  Sanders
1992 then their evolution is linked to the evolution of starburst galaxies which are
closely related to mergers Sanders  Mirabel 1998 Our results indeed indicate some
synchronization between the two populations in the sense that the peak of the formation
function of ES0s in the best t model zpeak  2 is close to the peak of the evolution
functions of starburst galaxies zpeak  14 Future works exploring this possible link will
provide important constraints to the evolution of both populations
 28 
IR-quiet star-forming galaxies
Our results Fig 13  15 show that only a small fraction 10  20  of UV selected
galaxies as in the sample of FOCA survey Milliard et al 1992 are IR bright as indicated
by the small contribution of simulated dusty galaxies to the UV counts the ES0 galaxies
contribute even less This suggests a separate population of IR quiet UV bright galaxies
which dominate the UV selected samples Such a population is also needed for the B-band
counts because our simulations under-predict 30  50 of observed counts in that band
while fully account for the R and K band counts Fig 13  15 The best candidates
for such galaxies are the low-metallicity therefore low dust content blue dwarf galaxies
such as I Zw 18 Searle  Sargent 1972 There is an apparent link between this IR quiet
star-forming galaxy population and the faint blue galaxies found in deep optical surveys
see Koo  Kron 1992 and Ellis 1997 for reviews What is the relation between this
population and the dusty IR bright star-forming galaxies How does this population
evolve backwardly with the redshift and how does this evolution correlate with the
evolution of IR bright galaxies Are Lyman Break Galaxies being selected by the UV ux
in the rest frame more closely related to the IR quiet star forming galaxies or to the dusty
star forming galaxies as argued by Adelberger  Steidel 2000 Answers to these questions
will help to unify the pictures of galaxy formationevolution seen in dierent wavebands
We plan to address these questions in our future work particularly in connections with the
forthcoming GALEX and SWIRE missions
8 Summary
New models for the evolution of extragalactic IR sources are presented in this paper
The models for dusty galaxies and for ES0 galaxies the latter contributing signicantly to
counts at wavelengths   10m have been developed separately
 29 
Compared to previously published models in Xu et al 2001 the new models for
evolution of dusty galaxies in this work have the following improvements
1 The evolution functions have the form of smoothly-joined 3-piece power-law Fig1
instead of the sharply-joined 2-piece power-law
2 New local luminosity functions at 25m which take into account the evolution
eects are used for the three dust galaxy populations ie normal late-type galaxies
starburst galaxies and galaxies with AGNs
3 The UV portion   3000A of the SEDs in the SED library is constrained by an
empirical correlation between fU V  fB and B  K instead of mere an extrapolation
of the optical SED   4000A
In order to address the question whether normal late-type galaxies or starburst galaxies
dominate among IR sources of z  05 three new models are developed
 Model S1  starburst galaxies dominant 
 Model S2  normal galaxies dominant
 Model S3  intermediate between S1 and S2
Predictions of these three models for counts in various bands are fairly close to each other
therefore they can hardly be distinguished using the counts They can also t very well
the luminosity functions of ISO 15m sources in three redshift intervals 04  z  07
07  z  1 1  z  13 In principle they can be distinguished by redshift distributions
of FIR sources but the large beams of FIR detectors such as the ISOPHOT cameras
make it rather dicult to pin-down the optical counterparts usually very faint of faint
FIR sources At the same time the peaks in the distributions of several IR and optical
 30 
colors predicted by these models have separated locations We argue that these color
distributions are the best tools to distinguish these models There are only very limited
amount of multi-waveband data available for high redshift dusty galaxies in the literature
mostly for ISOCAM 15m sources a situation that will be drastically improved when
SIRTF is launched and SWIRE surveys are available
The models for ES0s follow a simple passive evolution approach The basic
assumption is that there has been no star formation in an ES0 galaxy since its initial
formation Instead of assuming that all ES0s formed at once together as in the classical
monolithic galaxy formation scenario the ES0 galaxies are assumed to form in a broad
redshift range Franceschini et al 1998 specied by a truncated Gaussian function
The SEDs of dierent ages are calculated using the GRASIL code of Silva et al 1998
No dust emission is considered in these models Three such models with dierent ES0
formation histories are calculated Model E1 zpeak  5   05 Gyr is close to the
classical monolithic scenario Model E2 assumes a later and broader ES0 formation epoch
zpeak  2   2 Gyr Model E3 zpeak  1   3 Gyr assumes that most of ES0s are
formed at z  1 as the hierarchical galaxy formation works have advocated Kaumann
et al 1993 Kaumann  Charlot 1998 Comparisons with limited data eg colors
and redshift distribution available for morphologically identied ES0 galaxies at z 1
indicate that model E2 can t the data best among the three models This suggests a
synchronization between the evolution of ES0 galaxies and of starburst galaxies in the
sense that the peak of the formation function of ES0s zpeak  2 is close to the peak of
the evolution functions of starburst galaxies zpeak  14 Combining model predictions by
E2 with those by S1 S2 and S3 dusty galaxy evolution models comparisons with number
counts in dierent wavebands Fig1315 indicate that ES0s contribute upto 30  50 of
the opticalNIR counts in the bright end and about 20  30 of the ISOCAM 67m band
counts Their contributions to counts in the UV 2000A and in the longer wavelength IR
 31 
 12m bands are negligible
Using these new models for extragalactic IR sources particularly including ES0
galaxies we made new predictions for the counts and confusion limits in the SIRTF bands
The results indicate that SWIRE surveys will be confusion limited in the 70m and 160m
bands The confusion limits predicted by dierent models dier by up to 80 These
dierences reect the uncertainties of these predictions

Appendix
A New 25m Local Luminosity Functions for Three Populations
In Xu et al
2001 luminosity functions were presented for three population
subsamplesAGNs normal late-type galaxies and starbursts The subsamples were
determined by IRAS colors We have extended this work to take into account the eects
of luminosity evolution on the LLF estimates and to include a more comprehensive
uncertainty analysis
We recomputed the population LLFs including a luminosity evolution term of the
form 1  zq for values of q 0 30 and 45 This factor is applied to both the source
luminosity and the minimum luminosity detectable at the sources redshift The shape
parameters are tabulated in Table A1

The resulting LLFs with same normalization constant applied are plotted as
visibilities in panel a of Fig19 solid line is no evolution dashed is q30 dashed-dot is
q45 There is a small dierence between the LLFs at large luminosities The model
calculations in this paper use the LLFs with q30
We performed an analysis of the covariance of the tted parameters using the
information matrix Efstathiou et al 1988 In panels b c and d of Fig19 we have plotted
the 68 condence intervals in pairs of the parameters as ellipses under the assumption of
normally distributed uncertainties Avni 1976 Press et al 1992 In general the parameters
are not strongly correlated except for  and  for AGNs This correlation is explained by
the distribution of this population at higher relative redshifts the high-luminosity slope of
 34 
the luminosity function depends on the sum of  and  so the parameters are degenerate
when  is not well determined at low luminosities For the same reason the condence
intervals for AGNs for  and L are larger for the other populations The variations in
the parameters with evolution exponent are for the most part small compared to the
uncertainties in the parameters
B Extrapolation of SEDs to the UV Bands
In Xu et al 2001 the UV 1000  4000A SEDs are extrapolations from data points
in the B J H and K bands and therefore are not well constrained In this work this is
improved by introducing the following constraints
1 The UV-B vs B-K correlation The correlation is established using a sample of
galaxies detected both in the vacuum UV bands 1500A  2500A and in the FIR
bands IRAS The sample is taken from Xu  Buat 1995 The K-band magnitudes
are found in the 2MASS database
In Fig20 the UV-B vs B-K color-color
plot for this sample is presented The sample is divided into galaxies with AGNs
f60mf25m  04 galaxies with IR excess f60mf25m  04 and Lf irLB  05
and normal late-types f60mf25m  04 and Lf irLB  05 Data of the three
ULIRGs observed by Trentham et al 1999 in UV using HST are also plotted They
follow the same trend of IR excess galaxies though with larger scatters We found
that the trend for normal late-types can be well tted by the following function
logf2000Af4400A  02  03  B  K  22
B  K  2
 02  01  B  K  2
B  K  2B1
 35 
and for galaxies with AGNs and galaxies with IR excess it can be well tted by a
two-step linear function
logf2000Af4400A  04  B  K  2
B  K  2
B  K  2
2 The UV slope We use the following relation between the UV slope  F  
1200A    2600A and the Lf irLB ratio found by Calzetti et al 1995 to
constrain the slope of the UV SEDs between 1200A and 2600A
  112  logLf irLB  094
3 Lyman-break A sharp drop-o is imposed to the SEDs shortward of 912A The ux
density decreases a factor of 30 from 912A to 700A There is a less steep drop-o
about a factor of 5 from 1200A to 912A which is to mimic the eect of the Ly
absorption
As an example the model SED of M82 is compared to data in Fig21
