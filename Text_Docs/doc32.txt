DETERMINING THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF GALAXIES BY
ASTROCLADISTICS  SOME RESULTS ON CLOSE GALAXIES
Fraix-Burnet D 1
Abstract Astrocladistics a methodology borrowed from biology is an objective way of understanding
galaxy diversity through evolutionary relationships It is based on the evolution of all the available param-
eters describing galaxies and thus integrates the complexity of these objects Through the formalization of
the concepts around galaxy formation and evolution and the identication of the processes of diversica-
tion build up secular evolution interaction mergingaccretion sweepingejection galaxy diversity can
be expected to organize itself in a hierarchy About 500 galaxies described by about 40 observables have
now been analysed and several robust trees found For instance we show that the Dwarf Galaxies of the
Local Group all derive from a common ancestral kind of objects We identify three evolutionary groups
each one having its own characteristics and own evolution The Virgo galaxies present a relatively regular
diversication with rather few violent events such as major mergers Diversication in another sample made
of gas-poor galaxies in dierent environments appears to be slightly more complicated with several diverging
evolutionary groups Work on a large sample of galaxies at non-zero redshifts is in progress and is pioneering
a brand new approach to exploit data from the big extragalactic surveys
Introduction
Astrocladistics is a methodology of data analysis that groups objects according to their evolutionary history
Fraix-Burnet 2004 Fraix-Burnet et al 2003 2006a 2006b 2006c It is particularly suited to complex objects
in evolution It is based on all available observables These properties are a priori considered as characterizing
the evolutionary behaviour of a particular component of a galaxy and are thus divided into several evolutionary
states Any change between two states is a progress in the evolution that is transmitted to the subsequent hence
more evolved kinds of objects Using all of these evolutionary properties the cladistic analysis groups objects
by estimating how much evolution is required between them The nal picture is depicted on a hierarchical tree
called a cladogram in which the distance between two branches reects the level of diversication that occurred
during evolution This is unlike trees obtained from multivariate distance analyses that only show dierences
averaged over all properties without any consideration of the detailed evolution of the dierent components in a
galaxy But this has a cost because the cladistic analysis is much longer to perform The cladistic analyses can
be performed on evolutionary groups of objects rather than individuals This is obviously the key to deal with
data from big surveys in which hundreds of thousands galaxies are described by about a hundred observables
at most Up to now we have obtained results on still modest samples of close galaxies and we progressively
resolve the challenge of including more and more objects and combining samples described by non-matching
sets of observables
2 Diversity of the dwarf galaxies of the Local Group
The astrocladistics analysis of the 36 dwarf galaxies of the Local Group described by 24 characters successfully
yields a robust tree demonstrating that all these objects have diversied from an ancestral common kind of
objects Fraix-Burnet et al 2006c This result is already important because it conrms the applicability of
cladistics to galaxies and more importantly opens the way toward determining in the future the nature of the
very rst objects of the Universe

Fig 1 Cladogram for the Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group Three evolutionary groups are identied on the tree and
characterized from their properties
Several astrophysical results are derived from this study The galaxy SagDIG is the less diversied from
an ancestral stage common to all this sample Interestingly SagDIG happens to be at the edge of the Local
Group By projecting values of the observables onto the tree we conclude that the evolutions of the properties
are rather complex in this sample of the Local Group showing that the dwarf galaxies are certainly easily
inuenced by their environment We also derive the characteristics of some groups corresponding to structures
in the tree Three are obvious and identied on Fig 1 The group that we call dynamic gathers galaxies
showing a lot of gas strong star formation and a complicated kinematics The second one called brilliant
gathers galaxies which are rather luminous but with a gentle kinematics and not much star formation The last
one the dying group has objects which seem to be the dead-end of dwarf galaxies with no gas and a low
luminosity These three groups are all well dierentiated from SagDIG they all evolved in their own way
This work can be certainly improved by incorporating new data which are much more detailed both spectro-
scopically and spatially However it is already clear from Fig 1 that the traditional morphological dichotomy
is too simplistic to describe the diversity and the evolution of dwarf galaxies We rather nd that the ancestral
group is of irregular shape dIrr but some other kinds of dIrrs appeared during evolution the dynamic
group while there are two very distinct groups of spheroidal galaxies dSph The three groups that we have
identied reveal a more physical insight into the origin of the diversity of these galaxies
3 Evolutionary history of Virgo galaxies
In a subsequent study Fraix-Burnet  Davoust 2006 analysed 222 galaxies of the Virgo cluster described by
48 observables Again a nicely resolved tree is found demonstrating that all these galaxies derive from the
same kind of objects This tree depicts the probable evolutionary scenario for these galaxies
One of the most interesting results is that the tree is relatively regular unbalanced meaning that the
diversication of the Virgo galaxies has been somewhat gentle The behaviours of all characters conrm that
the main drivers of evolution for these objects are soft processes like secular ie
isolated evolution weak
interactions and minor mergers and accretion see Fraix-Burnet et al 2006b
Several properties indicate that galaxies become bigger and more massive It is interesting to note that the
total amount of HI gas remains nearly constant with a signicant dispersion while the central surface density

Regular elliptisation
Rapid elliptisation
Galaxy rank along tree
Fig 2 Evolution of the morphology of Virgo galaxies represented by the de Vaucouleurs index as a function of the
rank of galaxies along the tree
of this gas decreases as expected if it forms stars and is then processed This points toward a continuous income
of gas in the outer parts of the galaxies Also there is a small evolutionary group of galaxies that is well
diversied from the common ancestral group but shows less massive objects This could correspond to galaxies
that have evolved but have not accreted much matter maybe because of their particular environment Galaxy
harassment may possibly be invoked as well
With such an unbalanced cladogram it is possible to represent the evolutionary scenario by plotting the
parameters versus the rank of the galaxies along the tree For instance the de Vaucouleurs index of morphology
is plotted in Fig 2 Obviously the Hubble mophological type is not an evolution indicator because no ancestral
state can be identied All types Irr S and E are present at the beginning of the evolution left side while
there is a clear lack of Irr and S at the end Hence we conclude that galaxies mostly become elliptical through
evolution However since ellipticals are also present on the bottom left of the diagram the rates for this
morphological evolution are diverse They can be grossly classied into two families a regular and lengthy
process through accretion minor mergers or weak interactions and a more brutal one that corresponds to
major mergers and strong interactions Galaxies all tend to become elliptical but more or less rapidly depending
mainly on their environment Henceforth for the morphological parameter there are several evolutionary paths
to achieve the same result
In Fig 3 we show the same diagram as Fig 2 but with the shape of the points indicating the activity
properties of galaxies such as nuclear starbursts LINERs and Seyferts phenomena It is obvious that the AGN
activity appears only on the right side of the diagram but not in all the corresponding galaxies We interpret
this fact as an evidence that something is acquired by galaxies during the course of evolution something that
allows AGN phenomena and that is transmitted to more evolved kinds of galaxies This is probably linked
to the central black hole but may be not only We call these galaxies as activable because they form a true
evolutionary group sharing a derived property In contrast the nuclear starbursts are present all along the
evolutionary history of the Virgo galaxies
4 Astrocladistics and big surveys
Astrocladistics is the only methodology that can fully exploit data of large catalogues and big surveys by using
all available observables at all wavelengths and by taking into account the evolutionary nature of galaxies We

environments The evolutionary scenario is here more complicated several evolutionary groups seem to be
present We will use these groups to combine the three samples studied so far in order to provide an evolutionary
scenario of about 500 objects This work is a prerequisite for our next project to analyse a very large sample of
SDSS galaxies The challenge is important but the reward can be huge For the rst time we will be able to
depict the diversication of galaxies with a true evolutionary perspective by including objects of the past at
non-zero redshifts
