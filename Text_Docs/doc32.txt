Abstract
Membrane receptors for neuromodulators NM are highly regulated in their distri-
bution and ecacy - a phenomenon which inuences the individual cells response
to central signals of NM release Even though NM receptor regulation is implicated
in the pharmacological action of many drugs and is also known to be inuenced by
various environmental factors its functional consequences and modes of action are
not well understood In this paper we summarize relevant experimental evidence
on NM receptor regulation specically dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in order to
explore its signicance for neural and synaptic plasticity We identify the relevant
components of NM receptor regulation receptor phosphorylation receptor track-
ing and sensitization of second-messenger pathways gained from studies on cultured
cells Key principles in the regulation and control of short-term plasticity sensiti-
zation are identied and a model is presented which employs direct and indirect
feedback regulation of receptor ecacy We also discuss long-term plasticity which
involves shifts in receptor sensitivity and loss of responsivity to NM signals Finally
we discuss the implications of NM receptor regulation for models of brain plasticity
and memorization We emphasize that a realistic model of brain plasticity will have
to go beyond Hebbian models of long-term potentiation and depression Plasticity
in the distribution and ecacy of NM receptors may provide another important
source of functional plasticity with implications for learning and memory

1 Introduction
G-protein coupled receptors GPCRs which comprise a major group of cel-
lular receptors on many types of cells including neurons undergo signicant
plasticity
GPCRs become desensitized phosphorylated as a form of short-term plastic-
ity which means that receptors are temporarily uncoupled from their eectors
G-proteins They also become down- or upregulated in a more lasting form
of plasticity which involves receptor tracking between intracellular stores
and the cell membrane and in some cases receptor degradation as well as new
protein synthesis These processes aect receptors for the main neuromodula-
tors serotonin dopamine noradrenaline and acetylcholine for neuropeptides
such as opioids for neurohormones such as steroids or estrogen as well as the
metabotropic glutamate mGLU and GABAB receptors in the brain
In general receptors are sensitized and desensitized in response to agonist
exposure modulated by cell internal parameters and synaptic activation Im-
portant parameters for receptor plasticity are cell-internal calcium and the
second-messenger dependent protein kinases A and C PKA and PKC as
well as G-protein specic kinases GRKs The time-scale of these changes is
within minutes for desensitization and several hours for alterations in receptor
distribution which is comparable to early and late long-term potentiation
The functional signicance of this adaptive regulation is at present not well
understood Receptor regulation has mainly be studied in response to vari-
ous pharmacological agents antipsychotics antidepressants drugs of abuse
where sensitization of NM responses has consistently been shown in dierent
tissues and cell types eg ventral tegemental area and nucleus accumbens
1 2 Behavioral eects of stress 3 learning inhibitory avoidance 4 5 6
and environment novelty social conditions have also been documented 7 8
This evidence which points at an experience-dependent regulation of NM re-
ceptors coexists with a signicant body of data showing constitutive expres-
sion of receptors to dierent types of neurons The level of receptor expres-
sion varies for projection neurons cortical pyramidal cells or striatal medium
spiny projection neurons vs local interneurons fast-spiking vs regular spik-
ing neurons 9 10 for dierent cortical layers or for patches in amygdala
or striatum 5 according to neuropeptide colocalization eg substance P
enkephalin 11 and for neurons with a dierent connectivity striato-nigral
vs striato-pallidal neurons 12 There is also developmental regulation of
receptor expression which is dierent postnatally 13 14 during adolescence
15 16 as well as during ageing 17
Constitutive receptor distribution sets the boundaries within which experien-
ce-dependent uctuations occur These uctuations may be transient or they
may have a permanent component corresponding to short-term desensitization
and long-term down- or up-regulation In this paper we provide an overview
of the biological mechanisms involved in NM receptor regulation with the goal
of analyzing the adaptive function of this process We will nd that receptor
ecacy undergoes signicant changes that are important in mediating neu-
romodulatory signals We will also nd that the regulatory processes under-
lying receptor plasticity are partly overlapping with the processes underlying
LTPLTD
We suggest that NM receptor regulation is a process which has the capacity
to contribute to brain plasticity on the population level on the level of the
individual neuron and probably also on the level of the synapse This provides
a mechanism for memorization and an added storage capacity beyond Hebbian
long-term potentiation and long-term depression A better insight into the role
of NM receptor regulation may lead to a new understanding of brain plasticity
and a thorough revision of current theories of memory and learning
2 Protein Regulatory Networks Underlying Receptor Plasticity
21 Component processes of receptor regulation
The molecular biology of receptor regulation has been elucidated in consider-
able detail mostly by studies on cultured cells stably transfected with recep-
tors at xed concentrations
A number of dierent components have been identied
1 conformational change of receptor protein and functional uncoupling from
eectors G-proteins by phosphorylation
2 translocation of receptors from the membrane to a cytoplasmic structure
in endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus receptor internaliza-
3 reduction in potency and ecacy of a receptor in inducing changes in
second-messenger concentration adenylyl cyclase cAMP desensiti-
zation
4 receptor degradation in lysosomes which removes receptor proteins
from the cytoplasma as well as the plasma membrane
5 translocation from a pool of internally stored receptors to the membrane
recruitment resensitization
6 delivery of newly synthesized receptors to the membrane protein syn-
thesis
This shows that receptor regulation is far from being a simple process as
might be expected if homeostatic regulation by feedback control were its only
function Rather the layering of several processes indicates that both short-
term and long-term regulation of receptors occurs and that dierent entry-
points for interacting processes exist to inuence the outcome of a specic
stage in receptor regulation
The prototype case for GPCR regulation has been the regulation of the -
adrenergic receptor 18 19 but the processes involved are somewhat dierent
for each individual GPCR type We focus here on the dopamine D1 receptor
which is also well documented and which is of considerable signicance in the
regulation of membrane excitability and neural signal transmission

is shown Note the direct feedback regulation via PKA also via RGS GRK and the
indirect regulation via calcium GRK Possible interactive eects between cAMP
and Ca are also shown
Functional D1 receptors are coupled to G-proteins which form heterotrimer-
ic complexes When receptors become activated the coupled G-proteins dis-
solve into two components G and G These components have the ability
to modulate a number of membrane ion channels such as inwardly rectify-
ing K channels eg GIRK channels 20 Ih and other K channels 21
high-voltage gated calcium channels L-type PQR-type and N-type calcium
channels 22 23 and also sodium channels 24 25 D1 receptors further-
more have the eect of increasing NMDA transmission 26 27 and may have
complex eects on local calcium levels 28
D1 receptors communicate with cell-internal pathways by activating Golf -
proteins 29 which raise adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-levels cAMP-levels and
calcium levels are required for the activation of the transcription factor CREB
and the early genes fos and delta-fosB Both proteins regulate the transla-
tional activity of mRNA and are critically involved in new protein synthesis
D1 receptor coupling is reduced by protein kinases - both cAMP-dependent
kinase PKA and G-protein specic kinases GRKs 18 30 These kinases
phosphorylate the receptor protein and contribute to the desensitization of its
eect on second messengers Calcium indirectly reduces desensitization via
the calcium-dependent protein calmodulin which inhibits GRKs 31 Anoth-
er pathway for calcium to prevent desensitization has recently been detected
in the calcium sensor NCS-1 which reduces phosphorylation and internal-
ization of the D2 receptor 32 Arrestins can increase the eects of GRKs
for instance overexpression of arrestins reduces the ability of -adrenergic
receptors to activate GS by  75 33 They play a major role in the inter-
nalization of receptors
Desensitization is furthermore inuenced by RGS-proteins which regulate G-
proteins and G-protein signaling by activating GTPase 34 35 36 GTPase
is the kinase which phosphorylates G-proteins and renders them insensitive
to receptor activation RGS proteins take part in producing fast kinetics in
vivo by favoring reformation of the heterotrimeric state G  G while
the hydrolysis of GTPase is 40-fold slower in the absence of RGS 34 The
eect of overexpression of RGS proteins is a change in kinetic rate an accel-
eration of the desensitization-resensitization cycle and also a net decrease of
desensitization RGS levels themselves may become upregulated by dopamine
D1 and D2 activation eg in striatum specically RGS-2 and RGS-4 seem to
be enhanced by D1 or D2 receptor activation respectively 37 38
3 Short-Term Desensitization of Receptors
31 Receptor phosphorylation and desensitization of second-messenger acti-
Receptor ecacy in general is determined by the amount of functional coupling
of an agonist and the reactivity of eector pathways
Receptor phosphorylation and internalization aect signal transduction by
agonist binding as a form of short-term variation Membrane receptors undergo
functional decoupling by phosphorylation at multiple Ser and Thr residues
which induces conformational change of the protein and prevents eective
ligand binding 39 40 Phosphorylation is fast with a half-time of less than
a minute for the D1 receptor and it is also reversible upon agonist removal
with a half-time for resensitization of about 10-15 minutes for the D1-receptor
41 42 cf 43
Phosphorylation and internalization may be achieved by PKA which is cAMP-
dependent or by GRKs which are subject to regulation by calcium via calmod-
ulin or NCS-1 44 45 46 Calcium may enhance receptor ecacy when in-
tracellular calcium binds to calmodulin and inhibits GRKs eg GRK5 46
Interestingly there may be another corrective pathway for a direct inter-
action between calcium and GRK the inhibition of GRKs by calmodulin can
be abolished by high levels of calcium-dependent protein kinase C PKC
47 In general overexpression of GRKs leads to reduced functional coupling
and requires more agonist to achieve the same amount of eect on second
messengers subsensitivity 48 49 50
The role of PKA in phosphorylation of the D1 receptor is to a certain degree
controversial 51 There is indirect evidence from cell lines with reduced PKA
activity where desensitization is attenuated 52 and from mutant receptors
which lack a PKA phosphorylation site where the onset time of desensitization
is greatly reduced 39 Also 53 and 54 show that stimulating PKA can
mimic agonist-dependent desensitization But there are also data by 55 56
which seem to indicate that PKA is not important in desensitization The
work by 40 based on a PKA-insensitive mutant receptor suggests that
PKA has a major eect on receptor tracking within the cell and increases
proteolysis but is not strictly required for desensitization of cAMP Thus it
has been suggested that PKA modies a later process in desensitization which
is more intimately linked to internalization and recycling probability rather
than agonist-induced phosphorylation In this sense GRKs and PKA are most
eective at dierent stages of the desensitization process This would also
imply a dierent time course of their feedback regulation since PKA would
operate with a longer delay in its reduction of receptor ecacy
32 Key factors in desensitization
When a receptor is in a phosphorylated state it is eectively uncoupled from
its eectors until it becomes dephosphorylated For the dopamine D1 receptor
both of these processes can be performed without internalizing the receptor
However internalization is often the consequence of phosphorylation and both
processes together may be termed desensitization since they aect the func-
tional ecacy of a receptor population in transmitting signals to intracellular
pathways

Fig 2 Desensitization of the cAMP pathway for the D1 receptor Data have been
combined from 57 41 and 55 The sigmoid shape of the dose-response rela-
tionship is clearly evident in the vertical axis Length of pretreatment in contrast
seems to follow a logarithmic curve The reduction of ecacy can reach up to 80
To study the desensitization mechanism for a given receptor receptors are
overexpressed in cultured cells and then exposed to agonists at dierent con-
centrations and for dierent times The amount of functional coupling is as-
sessed by measuring concentrations of adenylyl cyclase or cAMP These ex-
periments have shown that functional ecacy strongly depends on the level
of agonist exposure
Fig 2 3 show the time course of desensitization by measuring the concentra-
tion of adenylyl cyclase and cAMP In Fig 2 data from 57 41 and 55
are combined The desensitization of the D1 receptor reduces the ability of a
brief dopamine challenge to enhance adenylyl cyclase and cAMP-levels This
desensitization is both dose-dependent and dependent on pretreatment time
Dose-dependence follows a sigmoidal shape with a critical range between 106
and 107 mol dopamine Pretreatment time does not increase desensitization
much beyond an initial eect Overall there is a reduction in receptor ecacy
of up to 80
Fig 3 shows similar data from the desensitization of the D2 receptor 58 The
D2 receptor has the capacity to inhibit the adenylyl cyclasecAMP pathway
and this capacity is reduced by agonist-dependent desensitization only up
to 20 The critical range of agonist exposure however is similar Again

are taken from 58 Possibly sigmoidal and logarithmic shapes of the curves are less
evident probably as a result of the limited data set The eect of desensitization is
limited to about 20
pretreatment time here up to 6 h is not a strong factor
We can derive a general functional form for receptor ecacy C which reects
the dependence on agonist stimulation A
1  eA
The amount of agonist stimulation can be described by an integral over the
NM concentration

The sigmoidal shape of the function reects the fact that receptor ecacy is
almost linearly dependent on agonist exposure within a certain concentration
range and reaches saturation or stays below a threshold otherwise This is
visualized in Fig 4 Furthermore Fig 4 shows the modication of this basic
shape by additional parameters s below
It may well be that receptor desensitization depends on the particular time
course of agonist exposure rather than the total amount These experiments
though technically feasible have not systematically been carried out For in-
stance phasic increases of NM concentrations which are short-lasting may fail
to desensitize receptors signicantly while tonic increases with a smaller to-
tal amount of agonist stimulation may have a larger eect However in the
absence of experimental data integrating over agonist concentrations in time

Dotted lines     show shifts in dose-dependence I1 dashed lines - - correspond
to the rate of desensitization I2 dashed-dotted lines - correspond to the degree
of agonist-dependence 
seems to be the best approximation Further work may allow to rene the
formula in eq 2 to incorporate dierent temporal patterns of agonist stimu-
lation
This basic agonist-dependent desensitization may be modied by a number of
factors First of all as we have seen there are several cell-internal parameters
which inuence the magnitude of desensitization For instance a high level of
GRKs shifts the agonist-dependence curve to the right 48 49 50 A basic
parameter I1 allows to express sub- and supersensitivity of receptors dened
by dose-dependence of agonist exposure
1  eAI1
Presumably the amount of phosphorylation by protein kinases can be ex-
pressed with this parameter Experimental data show that I1 can be ma-
nipulated by overexpression of GRK 50 Wed similarly expect increased
calciumcalmodulin to have an eect on this parameter
The action of RGS proteins is dierent in that it has a signicant eect on the
resensitization dynamics Receptors prompt conversion of the inactive G pro-
tein to an active form RGS proteins accelerate the conversion of the activated
G protein back to its inactivated form 35 36 Several studies have shown
59 34 that reduced RGS activity leads to signicantly less receptor ecacy
both in terms of slow onset and prolonged recovery times measured by N-
type calcium channel or GIRK channel activity see Fig 5 In contrast high
RGS levels lead to fast recovery and may reduce onset of receptor activation

Fig 5 Desensitization dynamics modulated by RGS-proteins The functional shape
is adapted from 34 and 60 according to alterations in the half recovery time t05
and the rise time trise
Thus RGS proteins speed up resensitization and aect receptor ecacy inde-
pendent of agonist levels This eect can be expressed by a parameter I2
AI1
Finally desensitization depends on the amount of time a receptor exists in
the functional conformational state Receptors may exhibit a high degree of
spontaneous conformational change which means that they become activated
even in the absence of agonist binding For dopamine receptors D5 receptors
which are similar to D1 receptors have a high degree of this constitutive
activity 64 cf 65 66 This can be expressed by a factor for desensitization
 which is constitutive for each receptor type
AI1
Receptor ecacy as measured by eects on cAMPadenylyl cyclase need not
be identical to eects on membrane ion channels and consequently neural
transmission But in general dopamine D1 mediated eects on membrane ex-
citability can be mimicked by forskolin-mediated stimulation of PKA impli-
cating the cAMP-pathway as the major factor in regulating membrane prop-
erties The cAMPadenylyl cyclase pathway thus provides an important state
parameter for the regulation of protein phosphorylation the expression level
of protein kinases and a common pathway for a number of G-protein coupled
receptors Strictly synaptic components of receptor activation NMDA channel
regulation and presynaptic regulation of transmitter release however may be
regulated by other pathways with prominent dependence on calcium and pro-
tein kinase C levels The cAMP-pathway also inuences early gene expression
c-fos delta-fosB CREB which are important variables for protein synthesis
and any functional cell plasticity that is regulated in the long-term Thus we
can regard regulation of the cAMP pathway as a basic mechanism that may
aect receptor ecacy for both membrane excitability and gene expression
protein synthesis cf 67 41 The relation between receptor ecacy and
synaptic modulation may be regulated in a somewhat dierent way
We have seen that the ecacy of the D1 receptor in raising intracellular cAMP-
levels depends on the inuence of dierent factors on the desensitization func-
Three dierent types of parameter  I1 I2 can be distinguished by their
inuence on receptor ecacy see Fig 4
I1 shifts the function to the left or right without aecting its shape corre-
sponding to an alteration of the dose-response relationship
I2 alters the steepness of the function and thus the temporal properties of
receptor desensitization
 attens the curve indicating less dependence on agonist stimulation
This basic variability of receptor ecacy emerges from the parametrization
of the functional form Parameter tting to experimental data may allow a
further quantitative analysis of these functional relations
33 Feedback loops in regulating receptor ecacy
In this section we will outline a model for the dynamic interactions that de-
termine receptor ecacy We will develop a qualitative approach that demon-
strates the emergence of bistability in receptor ecacy - understood here as
a stable state which results from a prolongation of the cellular response be-
yond the actual duration of the signal In a slightly dierent sense bistability
emerges when there are trigger signals both to induce a new state and to turn

A system of equations denes a simulation model for the regulation of receptor
ecacy C Concentrations for PKA Ca and RGS Vx are determined by an inde-
pendent component Ix and by feedback from the receptor activation VN M  GRK is
determined by IGRK and the calcium level VCa  is regarded as a xed parameter
for the D1 receptor The actual receptor activation VN M is modeled as a product
of agonist concentration and receptor ecacy
it o cf 68 69 70 for discussions of bistability and multistability in this
context and as we shall see this condition is probably also met The model
is purely qualitative an attempt to illustrate the conditions that might un-
derlie a short-term regulation of receptor ecacy that provides an important
physiological state parameter for understanding the computational properties
of neuromodulation But a full numerical model eg based on chemical mass-
action models 71 72 could be developed on the basis of this approach and
would allow more detailed investigations of these interactions
The model determines the parameters I1 and I2 in eq 5 from kinase activity
I1 and RGS-level I2 The protein regulatory interactions that determine
the parameters I1 and I2 in this model are described by a number of equations
as shown in Table 1 Each of the concentrations in the model is calculated from
a component that is independent of feedback within the system ICa IP KA
IGRK and IRGS and a component that depends on the activation of the re-
ceptor VN M  GRK levels specically are inuenced by indirect feedback via
calcium levels - which provides an entry-point for a more complex regulation
of GRK levels by other processes aecting calcium The ratio between these
components is determined by the factors i and i This analytical approach
of separating system-internal components from outside inuences has clear ad-
vantages in model construction and control over system components and also
enables modular construction with clearly dened interfaces which is lacking
in more bottom-up approaches to intracellular modeling 72 73
However it is assumed that the eect of the receptor activation VN M on the
concentration is only linear - raising or lowering levels by an amount propor-
tional to VN M  This is a simplifying assumption that may have to be examined
in further work


Fig 6 The diagram shows the dependencies between the concentrations for the
kinases GRK and PKA for calcium and the role of RGS proteins The factors i
i and i are shown as labels on the links between parameters
Fig 6 visualizes the relations between the parameters The target regulated
value is the receptor ecacy C The actual receptor activation eect VN M is
dened by both the ecacy C and the current agonist stimulation IN M  The
main parameters I1 and I2 are dened by concentrations of the kinases PKA
and GRK VP KA and VGRK and the levels of RGS-proteins VRGS Specif-
ically I1 which determines the right- or left shift of the dose-response curve
for the receptor is assumed to be a linear combination of the concentrations
for the two kinases Since these kinases may act with dierent time courses
a more complex interaction may have to be empirically determined by more
detailed experimental work
C is being set by the agonist exposure summed over time and indirectly by
the PKA GRK and RGS levels There is also some experimental evidence
concerning the free parameters i i and i in the system For instance the
ratio 11 should be larger than 33 This is the case since the contribution
of D1 receptor activation to PKA levels is probably much higher than its
contribution to calcium levels 28 57 41 55 Also 2  1 since GRK
seems to have a stronger eect than PKA on receptor regulation see above
section 31
With this system we arrive at a simplied but functional model for the com-
putation of receptor activation taking the internal state of the neuron dened
by protein and calcium concentrations into account Further work is needed
to more fully develop such a model as a basis for empirical predictions and in
close correspondence with ongoing experimental work cf 72 for an example
of such experimental validation
However even the basic model can be employed to illustrate the emergence
of a limited form of bistability which may provide an important prerequisite
for functional long-term plasticity as memory for brief signals to appear
Receptor ecacy undergoes both negative cAMP-dependent and positive
calcium-dependent RGS-mediated feedback There are two main regulatory
loops the PKAPKC-mediated and GRK-mediated feedback PKAPKC are
up-regulated by D1 and thus provides a negative feedback loop GRK levels
are inuenced by internal calcium and thus constitute a positive feedback loop
In general negative feedback leads to oscillatory dynamics with appropriate
phase delays while additional positive feedback can lead to the establishment
of multistability 74
The presence of antagonistic feedback eects suggests bistability mediated
by calcium in the presence of slow oscillatory rhythms regulated by PKA A
simulation of the system shows the emergence of these features The graph in
Fig 7 shows the induction and persistence of a state of high receptor ecacy
by two calcium spikes
   INM 
VNM 
Fig 7 Calcium-induced multistability of receptor ecacy This simulation uses the
model dened in Table 1 with a time delay for VP KA 1IP KA 1VN M delay
Brief triggering increases in calcium concentrations ICa induce changes in receptor
ecacy C maintained by positive feedback and switched o by delayed increase in
PKA-level Actual receptor activation V-NM has dierent magnitudes for identical
signals IN M 
In the rst case the increase in calcium precedes a neuromodulatory signal
Due to feedback eects the increase in receptor ecacy C persists even when
the calcium signal is terminated Accordingly the response of the receptor to
this signal is increased compared to an agonist signal in the absence of calcium
second signal This model also shows a critical dependence of response on the
respective timing of Ca and IN M signals which should be testable empirically
The existence of bistable or multistable states that persist beyond the dura-
tion of a trigger signal shows the realization of an important computational
principle the equivalent of a ip-op device This is a basic memory element
and probably a necessary component for long-term plasticity of NM receptor
ecacy The critical dependence of ecacy on relative timing of calcium and
NM signals opens up interesting perspectives for an interaction of NMDA and
D1 related signals
4 Long-term Plasticity of Neuromodulatory Receptors
41 Receptor super- and subsensitivity
Besides the short-term processes of densensitization and resensitization there
are also distinct processes of long-term regulation of NM receptor ecacy 75
Long-term alterations in receptor ecacy for membrane-bound responses can
be measured directly by responsivity to agonist stimulation
Both subsensitive and supersensitive populations of cells have been described
in various tissues Dopamine D1 supersensitivity has been shown in stria-
tum after interruption of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal pathway 76 or in
genetically altered dopamine-decient mice 77 Exposure and withdrawal
conditions for amphetamine or cocaine also change dopamine receptor sensi-
tivity For instance there is D1 receptor supersensitivity in nucleus accumbens
78 79 80 1 81 and D2 receptor subsensitivity in nucleus accumbens 82 79
and ventral tegmental area 79 Treatment with antipsychotic medication has
also shown consistent shifts in receptor sensitivity in a number of brain areas
ventral tegmental area prefrontal cortex basal ganglia83 84 85 Fur-
thermore experiments after specic learning events such as socialization or
restraint stress have been reported to aect receptor density For instance D2
receptor binding density in striatum is increased for socially dominant mon-
keys and reduced for subordinate monkeys 7 and induction of overexpression
of D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens by genetic transfer in rats correlates with
an increased resilience to alcohol addiction 86 Alterations in density of mus-
carinic receptors in neocortex and amygdala have been observed as the result
of training in an inhibitory avoidance task 6 87
Receptor density can be indirectly assessed by the binding capacity of recep-
tors to radioligands for membrane receptors or the amount of mRNA for
a receptor which comprises both internalized and membrane-bound receptor
protein With brain imaging PETSPECT radioligand binding can even
be measured in the living human brain 88 89
Similarly to short-term desensitization receptor density tends to increase at
low concentrations of agonist and decrease at high levels of stimulation For
instance ongoing agonist stimulation  4h has been shown to result in
long-term loss of membrane-bound receptor density for the dopamine D1 re-
ceptor in cultured cells up to -50 of control with t12 8h 90 This basic
homeostatic regulation is however embedded in a system of further regulatory
factors which allow storage and permanence of receptor localization and den-
sity Thus long-term shifts in receptor density and ecacy may also be the
result of specic brief co-ordinated events that aect relevant parameters in a
sustained fashion In this sense long-term plasticity in receptor density may
have a memorization function that goes beyond adaptivity to current agonist
concentrations
Another question is the relationship between receptor density and functional
receptor sensitivity Often receptor density is directly parallel to functional re-
ceptor sensitivity as measured by eects on membrane excitability or synaptic
transmission Thus agonist depletion produces both an increase in receptor
density and an increase in electrophysiological responsiveness eg of beta-
adrenergic receptors in hippocampus and cortex 91 or for opioid receptors
after morphine withdrawal 92
But increased sensitivity of a receptor may occur without an increase of recep-
tor density The pharmacodynamic response to agonist occurs in proportion
to the quantity of the ternary complex agonist-receptor-G-protein not just
receptor protein abundance per se or even membrane-bound receptor protein
abundance 93 94 Receptors can exist both in a state where they are coupled
to GTP-free G-proteins high anity to agonists or they may exist without
the eector molecule G-protein coupled to it the low anity state 95 The
supply of G-proteins is restricted in cells such that there is competition for
receptors to achieve a high anity state Experimental evidence has indicated
that there are shifts in anity of D2 receptors in nucleus accumbens after
exposure to amphetamine which can explain increases of D2-receptor medi-
ated behavior even though the total receptor density remains unaltered 96
In this case D2 receptor supersensitivity is expressed by an increase in high
anity G-protein coupled receptor sites 97
This form of plasticity has certain implications If we assume that receptor
localization on the cell membrane ie at synaptic sites is relevant for neural
transmission changes in anity can modulate transmission without aecting
receptor localization This may be important for the retention of the functional
properties of the modulated system
Finally long-term alterations of receptor sensitivity may be expressed by al-
terations in intracellular pathways such as a permanent upregulation of the
cAMP-pathway 98 In this case the shift in sensitivity is not specic to
the type of receptor but to the pathway being modulated which is usually
connected to a number of dierent receptors Thus there is a third process
available to eect long-term changes in receptor ecacy
Detailed experiments on dopamine receptor sensitivity have been conducted
in slices of rat brain after exposure to cocaine or amphetamine
Sensitivity is here usually assessed by response threshold to dierent concen-
trations of agonist For nucleus accumbens in cocaine-sensitized animals a
much lower dose of dopamine 20M elicits a electrophysiological response
in D1 receptors than is required in control animals 75M 99 The eect of
the higher dose 75M is the same in the supersensitive and normal system
99 Thus there is a leftward shift in dose-dependence which is compatible
with a change in the I1 parameter for receptor ecacy see eq 4 above
Alternatively the normal response to NM modulation may become replaced
by an ongoing chronic response and the cell becomes subsensitive or ceases
to be responsive to agonist stimulation This form of whole-cell plasticity is
not dependent on neuromodulator receptors but consists of a shift in the ion
channel distribution and density that denes membrane excitability eg 100
101 For instance in cocaine-sensitized animals some cells constitutively
suppress the N- and P-type calcium channels that are normally suppressed by
D1 receptor activation 102 The eect is a loss of NM responsivity on this
parameter
42 NM eects on neural transmission
The neural response is a product of both agonist concentration and the current
receptor ecacy Previous computational models that attempted to assess the
function of neuromodulation on the basis of variable agonist concentrations
103 104 assuming that receptor response would be uniform in space and
time may have failed to factor in the real receptor variability which as we
have seen is highly regulated and therefore likely to be of functional impor-
tance rather than only a source of unreliability and error noise
Generally neuromodulators have the potential to aect both synaptic trans-
mission and intrinsic whole-neuron membrane properties The synaptic ef-
fects of the D1 receptor and NM receptors in general concern the regulation
of transmitter release by presynaptic receptors and the regulation of NMDA-
mediated glutamatergic transmission by postsynaptic receptors 105
Neuromodulators also have diuse eects on the membrane potential of the
neuron mediated by alterations in ion channel currents from receptors on the
dendrite and soma in postsynaptic and non-synaptic positions 106 107 The
signicance of whole-neuron modulation however is considerably less well
investigated as a source of memorization and learning
There is a consensus that both presynaptic D1 108 109 110 111 112 113
114 and D2 receptors 115 116 117 118 119 depress the amplitude of evoked
EPSPs in a number of dierent tissues with some debate as to whether the
frequency of spontaneous EPSPs is similarly reduced 120 114 or actually
increased by presynaptic D1 receptors 121 A similar eect has been ob-
served for the regulation of GABA release both D1 and D2 receptors reduce
evoked IPSPs 122 123 20 124 125 126 127 In postsynaptic position
dopamine D1 receptors enhance NMDA transmission by increasing peak con-
ductance and lowering the threshold voltage for NMDA receptor activation
26 128 27 129 There may also be an eect of dopamine D1 receptors on
AMPA receptors via phosphorylation of GluR1 subunits at Ser845 mediated
by inhibition of PP1 and PKA via DARPP-32 130 in striatal neurons
This conformational change increases the channel open time probability in
contrast to phosphorylation at Ser831 by PKC and caMKII which increases
AMPA channel conductance Thus dopamine may also be able to enhance
peak AMPA current in specic dopamine D1 receptor rich areas of the brain
On the neuronal level the eect of neuromodulators on signal transmission
is expressed by altering membrane excitability However it has been dicult
to assess these eects precisely with the help of in vitro slices and there is
some disagreement concerning the eects of the dopamine D1 receptor The
D1 receptor enhances or reduces the contribution of a number of ion channels
such as high-voltage activated calcium channels L-type calcium channels are
enhanced in neostriatal spiny neurons 22 N- and P-type calcium channels
are blocked 23 It also aects sodium 25 and potassium channels 21
The eects on neuronal ring patterns are obviously complex since they de-
pend on membrane voltage the distribution and frequency of dierent ion
channels and other events aecting ion channel currents
43 Synapse- and cell-specic receptor regulation
We have seen that there is a signicant body of evidence showing that NM
receptors undergo experience-dependent long-term plasticity
These results focus on the response of a population of neurons by examin-
ing a few selected neurons with the most pronounced alteration of response
Results are usually not reported with an emphasis on cell-specic variability
Nonetheless there is often considerable heterogeneity with respect to reactivi-
ty to NMs within a population of neurons in a slice J Seamans pers comm
for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in deep-layer prefrontal cortical cells with
high responders and low responders within a neuronal population Visual
inspection also shows a varying number of uorescent-labeled receptors on
cultured cells eg transfected with D2 receptors 131 which is understood
as an individual variability of receptor distribution and density S Rayport
pers comm Cellular binding patterns for dopamine receptors are dierent
for dierent neurons also in striatal slices 132133134 New techniques
of laser capture microscopy may be able to give clear answers on the question
of cell-specicity M Ariano perscomm
There are also results indicating that receptor density may vary in patches of
subcortical tissue or microcolumns in cortical tissue 135 For instance fear
conditioning inuences muscarinic receptor density dierentially in dierent
regions of the amygdala 87 136
Synapse-specic regulation has been shown conclusively in the short-term
137 NM receptors in synaptic positions are also anchored by scaolding
and anchoring proteins which indicates that positioning of membrane recep-
tors at a specic site is relevant to NM receptor action 138 139 Thus the
basic mechanisms for synaptic long-term plasticity exist Very recently 140
have actually shown direct synaptic plasticity at cholinergic synapses in hip-
pocampus
44 Functional consequences of long-term plasticity
We have argued that the eects of neuromodulation on neural transmission
are not suciently described by the uctuations in the concentration of ago-
nist but require an analysis of receptor sensitivity as well This means that
the responsivity of the cell as expressed by receptor density and ecacy will
determine the net eect on neural transmission
The consequences of this regulation are somewhat dierent whether we look at
this from the perspective of a homogeneous shift in sensitivity in a particular
brain area or whether we assume cell-specic eects to be present under
physiological conditions
Thus the plasticity located in the receptor and its internal transduction path-
way could be functionally signicant at the level of the individual cell and the
synapse This could be the case for both short-term and long-term plasticity
Fig 8 Two expanded views on information storage in neural networks A Process-
ing units are linked by connections of diering strengths Overloading and switching
allows fast modication of synaptic strengths B Processing units dier by their ac-
tivation of transfer function Neurons with dierent membrane properties interact
in a heterogeneous network
Long-term plasticity in the responsivity of neurons and synapses to a neu-
romodulatory signal implies a mechanism of information storage that is ex-
pressed by the placement of NM receptors leading to an individual cell signa-
ture Thus NM receptor plasticity adds a layer of storage capacity to neurons
and synapses which allows memorization other than through Hebbian process-
es see Fig 8 This hypothesis is considerably dierent from the widespread
assumption that neuromodulation inuences a global parameter for neural
transmission which is uniform for all cells and synapses in a targeted brain
region 104 141
Synapse-specic regulation of NM receptor ecacy and distribution specical-
ly adds an important dimension to traditional accounts of long-term potentia-
tion LTP and long-term depression LTD which focus on the contribution of
the glutamatergic pathway It introduces additional variables which determine
the magnitude of change of glutamate synaptic transmission when presynaptic
NM receptors are activated and postsynaptic receptors interact with NMDA
AMPA or GABAA receptors A NM signal-gated change in synaptic weight
reects a synapse-specic xed parameter namely the presence absence or
magnitude of a NM receptor mediated eect The presence of a strong pha-
sic increase of NM concentration will then result in fast synaptic switching
Fig 8 A This means that synaptic connections can be quickly and reversibly
set to a new weight without interfering with any long-term properties of
the glutamate transmission Technically this corresponds to overloading of
synaptic connections with several possible synaptic weights each of which can
be switched on by activation of appropriate NM receptors Such mechanisms
have occasionally been suggested in order to add to the known capabilities of
neural networks 142 143 In 144 it was shown that template switching by
neuromodulator control of presynaptic release is particularly amenable to the
idea of state-dependent task performance which is a major biological function
of neuromodulation
45 Implications for brain plasticity
The idea that neuromodulation contributes to long-term potentiation and
long-term depression inuencing the magnitude of change in glutamatergic
transmission has been around for a long time A number of experimental re-
sults have been obtained that support a measurable dierence for LTPLTD
in the presence or absence of high levels of neuromodulators such as dopamine
145 146 In this context the theoretical concept of metaplasticity has been
developed 147 cf 148 This concept assumes a level of regulation for glu-
tamatergic plasticity that is not dependent on Hebbian associativity of pre-
and postsynaptic ring meta-level Another idea that forms the basis of a
number of computational accounts of dopamine-related plasticity 149 104
is three-factor Hebbian plasticity ie regulation of glutamatergic signalling
strength that requires a third factor namely dopamine in addition to concur-
rence of presynaptic and postsynaptic events Both approaches however do
not challenge the idea of glutamatergic signalling as a nal common pathway
for dierent sources of plasticity and the changes in glutamatergic signalling
as the substrate for learning
In contrast to that we have aimed to show that there is a signicant mo-
tivation from the perspective of molecular biology that receptor plasticity is
an ubiquitous phenomenon which may have become recruited for learning and
memorization for a number of dierent neurochemicals We have also reported
here that there is convincing electrophysiological evidence that shifts in recep-
tor sensitivity do occur in the long-term even though specicity for individual
cells and synapses is not well proven The exact relationship of this form of
plasticity to physiological brain adaptivity is at present virtually unknown
The eects of NM receptor activation on intrinsic properties of the neuron - ex-
pressed by membrane excitability and ion channel activation - add a signicant
dimension to brain plasticity The most prevalent view of neural plasticity as
altering the strength of connections between neurons is changed considerably
when we accept whole-neuron adaptive plasticity Fig 8 B
This role of whole-neuron plasticity within network processing has occasionally
been explored from a theoretical perspective cf 107 150 The alteration
of membrane properties due to neuromodulation or a specic composition
of ion channels induces a lter on signal transmission that may aect gain
modulation 151 or short-term retention of spike input patterns 152 A
signicant dierence in receptor density and sensitivity will aect the ecacy
of the intrinsic lter for each individual neuron
NM receptor regulation is specically interesting for its property of condi-
tional plasticity This means that dierences in parameter setting are greatly
enhanced when a sucient amount of agonist is present to engage NM recep-
tors The functional implications of NM receptor plasticity will be virtually
non-existent or very strong depending on uctuations in agonist concentration
or the presence of an agonist signal
5 Conclusion
Even though the relevance of the biological processes underlying G-protein
coupled receptor regulation to addiction research and psychopharmacology is
frequently asserted 98 we still do not have a good understanding of the
physiological function of this form of plasticity
The simplest theory would assert that receptor regulation is essentially a
homeostatic control mechanism to counteract the signicant uctuations in
agonist availability In this scenario the goal of receptor regulation is to en-
sure a target range of NM eectiveness
Certainly that is a very important function of receptor regulation from a
metabolic perspective But the presence of multiple nested feedback loops
in a complex highly regulated system suggests the presence of multistable
solutions The presence of receptor anchoring adds the necessary stability to
transform transient uctuations at synaptic sites into permanent values
In this paper we have focussed on the hypothesis 
a that neural information processing is inuenced by the combination of the
neurochemical signal the agonist concentration and the receptor response
the receptor ecacy or sensitivity
b that receptor ecacy is regulated on the level of the synapse and the
neuron and
c that long-term plasticity of NM receptors is functionally signicant in
information storage
The regulation of agonist concentration is of course another important factor in
understanding neuromodulation Even though short-term changes are mainly
a result of ring of the producer cells transporter availability is another major
factor that undergoes a form of functional plasticity 153 154 155
Other questions that require experimental analysis are the conditions that trig-
ger the transition from short-term to long-term plasticity and the behavioral
paradigms that inuence long-term receptor density and placement Certain-
ly further experimental evidence is required to explore the validity of this
hypothesis
Another important conclusion of this work is that the role that NMDA activa-
tion calcium inux and enhanced protein synthesis play in a large number of
behavioral learning experiments may have to be re-assessed without automat-
ic reference to the dogma of glutamatergic synaptic plasticity as the neural
substrate of learning and memory In contrast NMDA- and calcium- related
induction could point to a common integrated perspective on neural plastic-
ity encompassing glutamatergicGABAergic transmission neuromodulation
and the regulation of internal cell processes
We conclude that we need to pursue integrated models of neural and synaptic
plasticity which combine AMPA and glutamate related plasticity and NM
related plasticity into a single model Fundamentally new theoretical abstrac-
tions need to be developed that can provide a guideline in the experimental
testing of their implications Essentially we will have to explore the agonist-
dependence of NM receptor sensitivity and the concept of conditional plasticity
as the basis of learning rules for neuromodulation eg 156
Non-traditional sources of plasticity that may contribute to models of memo-
ry and learning are not restricted to plasticity in NM receptor activity They
include long-term alterations of the distribution of ion channels morpholog-
ical alterations in spine density and dendritic branching and levels of gene
expression for a number of proteins aecting intracellular pathways
The fundamental dogma of Hebbian plasticity - associative strengthening of
the synaptic connections that mediate fast neural transmission as neural sub-
strate for learning - may have to be reconsidered
The modication of synaptic connections has undoubtedly a major role in
experience-dependent plasticity - but the idea of associative strengthening
based on the co-occurence or in more modern views the precise timing of
pre- and postsynaptic activity may have to be embedded in a more compre-
hensive view involving NM induced switching overloading of synaptic values
or adaptive regulation of coupling strength In general the processes that gov-
ern cross-signaling in transmitter release are not suciently understood but
undoubtedly of importance in understanding synaptic plasticity as well as
the interaction of NM receptors with glutamate and GABA receptors in the
postsynaptic domain
But besides that we may have to further investigate the role of whole-neuron
plasticity in learning and memorization This involves the storage of experience
by cellular parameters and performing read-out by alteration of membrane
properties that aect the transfer function
In the light of the major potential sources of cellular plasticity uncovered by
molecular biology it may well be that the most signicant models on the
neural substrate of behavioral learning and memorization are yet ahead of us
