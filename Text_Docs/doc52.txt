CHAPTER 1
Introduction
How did the Universe begin How will it evolve How did all the structures such as
galaxies groups and clusters we observe in the night sky begin to form How did they
grow and how will they evolve These are some of the most profound questions the
mankind have and shall seek to answer
Observations of the cosmic microwave background CMB radiation from the time
when the Universe was only  380 0001 years old and signicantly smaller than today
have shown that the early Universe was extremely smooth containing only small  105
temperature anisotropies Komatsu et al 2009 Hinshaw et al 2009 Even so we
can observe a vast amount of different type of structure in visible light and in other
frequencies eg Blanton  Moustakas 2009 and references therein when looking at
the night sky The smooth early Universe must therefore have gone through radical
changes when evolving from the smooth primordial gas and dark matter density eld
to inhomogeneous structures such as dark matter haloes galaxies groups and clusters
observed directly or indirectly today
In physical cosmology the global evolution of the temperature pressure and density
elds can be studied using Friedmanns world models These models can describe the
evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic universe However as we do not live in an
empty universe a proof for that is obvious - you are reading this write up - we must also
describe how the small anisotropies seen in the CMB evolve During the early times in
the so-called linear regime the evolution of the density eld can be followed using linear
perturbation theory and Newtonian gravity However after the density perturbations
grow enough they start to collapse and their evolution turns nonlinear Their evolution
can still be followed using analytical approximations however their validity is limited
Fortunately more accurate methods have also been developed
Due to the inherently nonlinear nature of gravity cosmological N-body simulations
have become an invaluable tool when the growth of structure is being studied and mod-
elled closer to the present epoch Large simulations with high dynamical range eg
Springel et al 2005 Boylan-Kolchin et al 2009 have made it possible to model the for-
mation and growth of cosmic structure with unprecedented accuracy Moreover galax-
ies the basic building blocks of the Universe can also be modelled to good accuracy in
cosmological context and studied from their initial formation down to the present time
1Cold Dark Matter model has been assumed see Section 241
eg Naab et al 2007 For example semi-analytical models of galaxy formation eg
Somerville  Primack 1999 Somerville et al 2001 2008 allow us to populate dark
matter haloes with galaxies that are formed from baryonic matter when lacking hydro-
dynamical simulations eg Springel et al 2005 Croton et al 2006 Lucia  Blaizot
2007 Reassuringly both semi-analytical models as well as hydrodynamical simula-
tions which both model for example an inow of gas how gas can cool and heat up
again how stars are formed within galaxies and how stellar populations evolve are in
reasonable agreement with observational data at lower z  4 redshifts eg Kitzbich-
ler  White 2007 Instead at high redshifts z  6 the small number of candidate
galaxies eg Yan et al 2010 Labb et al 2010 Bouwens et al 2011 still compli-
cates more detailed comparisons to simulations eg Dayal et al 2011 Razoumov 
Sommer-Larsen 2010 Even so simulations can be used to make predictions for differ-
ent observables and aid when interpreting observational results The growth of cosmic
structures cosmological N-body simulations and formation of galaxies are briey re-
viewed in Chapter 2
Despite all the simulations and successes in recent years and decades there are still
many unanswered questions in the eld of galaxy formation and evolution One of the
longest standing issues in galaxy evolution is the signicance of the formation place and
thus initial conditions to a galaxys evolution in respect to environment often formulated
simply as nature versus nurture like in human development and psychology We are
therefore left to ponder if the galaxies we see today are simply the product of the pri-
mordial conditions in which they formed or whether experiences in the past change the
path of their evolution Unfortunately our understanding of galaxy evolution in different
environments is still limited albeit the morphology-density relation eg Oemler 1974
Dressler 1980 has shown that the density of the galaxys local environment can affect its
properties For example on average luminous non-starforming elliptical and lenticular
galaxies have been found to populate denser regions than star forming spiral galaxies
Consequently the environment should play a role in galaxy evolution however despite
the efforts the exact role of the galaxys local environment remains open
A group of galaxies is the most common galaxy association in the Universe eg
Holmberg 1950 Humason et al 1956 Turner  Gott 1976 Huchra  Geller 1982
Ramella et al 1995 Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 As such more than half of all galax-
ies are found in groups and small clusters They are therefore important cosmological
indicators of the distribution of matter in the Universe Moreover groups and clusters
can also provide important clues for galaxy formation and evolution physics as the prop-
erties of galaxies can be studied as a function of the local environment As a result
the environmental dependency in galaxy evolution can be understood to some extent in
terms of the group environment eg Moore et al 1996 1998 Mihos 2004 Fujita 2004
but see also Kauffmann et al 2004 Blanton 2006 Note however that the debate over
CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION
the exact role of group environment is far from over Groups of galaxies their properties
and the group environment in the context of galaxy evolution is discussed in Chapter 3
One fundamental question concerning groups of galaxies and closely related to
galaxy evolution in groups is whether the identied systems are gravitationally bound
or not This is a valid concern because from the observational point of view groups
and their member galaxies are not well dened Early studies based on simulations gave
hints that not all observed systems of galaxies are dynamically relaxed but might be
in the process of formation eg Diaferio et al 1994 Frederic 1995ab Despite this
many observational studies even today treat all identied groups like they were gravita-
tionally bound structures The work presented in Papers I and II tackles this issue and is
summarised in Chapters 35 and 36 respectively Results of this work show that a sig-
nicant fraction of systems of galaxies are gravitationally unbound when the most often
used grouping algorithm namely Friends-of-Friends is being applied to simulated data
This result has several important implications for the studies of galaxy groups and for
the evolution of galaxies in groups For example Paper II shows that groups with a large
excess of positive redshifts are more often gravitationally unbound than groups that do
not show any signicant excess Fortunately this prediction can be used together with
the methods developed for and presented in Paper I to assess whether observed groups
are likely to be gravitationally bound or not
Elliptical galaxies are most often found in dense environments like the cores of
groups and clusters eg Dressler 1980 Yet observations have shown that there is a
signicant population of isolated elliptical galaxies that are found in under-dense regions
with no bright nearby companions eg Aars et al 2001 Reda et al 2004 Smith et al
2004 Denicol et al 2005 Collobert et al 2006 Whether these galaxies originally
formed in under-dense regions or if the local environment has impacted their evolution
in form of a collapsed group is a profound question with long reaching implications
Key observations of galaxy evolution and the signicance of the environment for galaxy
evolution are briey reviewed in Chapter 4
The results of a theoretical case study of isolated eld elliptical galaxies Paper III
are also presented and summarised in Chapter 4 These results show that three differ-
ent yet typical formation mechanisms can be identied and that isolated eld elliptical
galaxies reside in relatively light dark matter haloes excluding the possibility that all of
them are collapsed groups as suggested earlier Additionally also another case study
concerning luminous infrared galaxies Paper IV is discussed The results of this study
imply a strong correlation such that more infrared-luminous galaxies are more likely to
be merger-driven However the results also imply that a signicant fraction more than
half of all high redshift infrared-luminous galaxies detected by Herschel Space Obser-
vatory are able to attain their high star formation rates without enhancement by a merger
These and other results discussed in Chapter 4 imply that both nature and nurture
play a role in galaxy evolution
CHAPTER 2
Formation of Structure
   the biggest blunder of my life
21 Historical perspective
Albert Einstein
The study of the structure formation of the Universe dates back to 1610 and Galileo
Galilei who realised that the Galaxy can be resolved into stars when observed through a
telescope Galileis observations can also be considered as a starting point for early ob-
servational cosmology However it was Ren Descartes and Thomas Wright who were
likely the rst ones to speculate and publish their cosmological views Already around
1760s Immanuel Kant and Johann Lambert developed the rst hierarchical model of
the Universe although since these early models it took almost two hundred years before
cosmology developed into a physical science and before the formation of structure in the
Universe could be truly appreciated and studied in a physical context Below I briey
mention a few key moments from the history that have lead to the structure formation
theory as we know it today However many important events are not mentioned thus
I refer the interested reader to more comprehensive reviews see eg Ratra  Vogeley
2008
It was Albert Einstein and his General Theory of Relativity GR in 1915 Einstein
1915 that gave birth to the physical cosmology as we know it today GR is a framework
that explains one of the four fundamental forces of the Universe namely gravity and
enabled cosmologists to predict the behaviour of a model universe As a result it became
possible for the rst time in the history of mankind to formulate self-consistent models
that describe the Universe and large-scale structure As a consequence in 1917 Einstein
derived the rst fully self-consistent model of the Universe Einstein 1917 However
soon after he realised that without modications his eld equations predicted that a static
Universe was not stable At the time the Universe was assumed to be static thus Einstein
introduced a cosmological constant  that enabled a static universe to solve the issue
In 1924 Aleksander Friedmann and in 1927 Georges Lemitre derived solutions for
expanding universes paving the way for evolving universe models Later Friedmanns
models became the standard models describing the dynamics of the Universe In 1927
Lemitre rst proposed what has come to be known as the Big Bang theory of the origin
22 OBSERVATIONAL BACKGROUND OF COSMOLOGY
of the Universe albeit the name was introduced by Fred Hoyle The framework for the
Big Bang model relies on the Einsteins GR the Cosmological Principle Friedmanns
equations and it is also the standard theory for the origin of the Universe
In 1935 Howard Percy Robertson and Arthur Geoffrey Walker derived independently
the space-time metric for all isotropic homogeneous uniformly expanding models of the
Universe However the Friedmann world models are isotropic and homogeneous thus
all observable structures such as galaxies and groups are absent Consequently the next
step towards developing more realistic models of the Universe was to include small den-
sity perturbations and to study their development under gravity namely the formation of
structure Fortunately already in 1902 well before GR sir James Hopwood Jeans had
shown that the stability of a perturbation depends on the competition between gravity
and pressure Jeans 1902 gas pressure prevents gravitational collapse on small spatial
scales and gives rise to acoustic oscillations Jeans showed that density perturbations can
grow only if they are heavier than a characteristic mass1 scale while below this scale
dissipative uid effects remove energy from the acoustic waves which dampens them
The application of the Jeans criterion and the growth of spherically symmetric perturba-
tions in an expanding universe were worked out by Lemitre and Richard Tolman in the
1930s Albeit it was not before 1946 when Evgenii Lifshitz worked out relativistic per-
turbation theory and started applying it to the linear growth of cosmic structure Finally
a general scheme for structure formation was rst outlined by Lev Davidovich Landau
and Lifshitz in the 1950s and developed further by Phillip James Edwin Peebles during
the 1970s
However to truly appreciate the study of the formation of structure of the Universe
observational constrains on the initial density perturbations were required The serendip-
itous discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background CMB radiation by Arno Penzias
and Robert Wilson in 1964 Penzias  Wilson 1965 predicted already in 1948 by
Ralph Alpher Robert Herman and George Gamow Gamow 1948 Alpher  Herman
1948 paved the way for understanding the initial conditions of large-scale structure for-
mation Measurements of the CMB describe the initial conditions after recombination
of the very early Universe and led way to the standard model of cosmology Further-
more large galaxy surveys of recent years have helped to set constrains for the models
of structure formation at low redshift
22 Observational background of cosmology
According to the Big Bang model the background radiation from the sky measured to-
day comes from the so-called last scattering surface As the name implies the surface of
last scattering is a spherical surface where the Cosmic Microwave Background photons
1Now referred to as the Jeans mass
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
were scattered for the last time2 before arriving at our microwave detectors This decou-
pling of photons from matter happened tcid63  380 000 years after the Big Bang during
the epoch of recombination when the rate of Thomson scattering became slower than the
expansion of the Universe eg Weymann 1966 Peebles 1968 At that moment pho-
ton interactions with matter became insignicant leading to the CMB radiation This
moment also denes the optical horizon the largest volume from which we can receive
information via photons
On the largest scales the most robust evidence for the isotropy of the Universe comes
from the CMB measurements while galaxy surveys compliment the CMB information
by probing later epochs and smaller angular scales Therefore in the next two Sections
I will briey review what the CMB and galaxy survey observations can tell us about the
formation of structure
221 Cosmic microwave background radiation
The epoch when the ionisation state of the intergalactic gas changed from being a fully
ionised plasma to a neutral gas is known as the epoch of recombination This is the
redshift z  1000 when the detailed anisotropy structure of the early Universe was
imprinted onto the Cosmic Microwave Background CMB It can therefore provide
information on the initial density perturbations and describe the Universe on the epoch
well before galaxies groups and the formation of large-scale structure
Ever since the discovery of the CMB radiation observations have played a key role
in shaping and constraining the standard model of cosmology for a review see eg Hu 
Dodelson 2002 Bartelmann 2010 The CMB observations probe the earliest observ-
able Universe and hence the initial conditions of the Universe such as its homogeneity
isotropy and atness Based on the CMB observations it has been established rst by
Cosmic Background Explorer COBE and later by Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy
Probe WMAP that the electromagnetic spectrum of the CMB is extremely close to a
thermal blackbody with a temperature  2725 K Moreover COBE and WMAP has
established that the largest temperature anisotropies T
T in the CMB are of the order of
 105 Smoot et al 1992 Hinshaw et al 2009 as shown in Figure 21 The absence
of  103 K uctuations alone show that the matter in the Universe must be dominantly
something that does not interact electromagnetically Peebles 1982 ie dark
The angular temperature uctuations associated with the primordial density pertur-
bations are assumed to originate in a rather narrow range of redshifts If this holds then
the pattern of the angular temperature uctuations in the CMB map Fig 21 gives us
a direct snapshot of the distribution of radiation and energy at the moment of recombi-
nation The angular scale   1  corresponds to the Hubble radius at recombination
2This however is not true for all CMB photons some have scattered from free electrons that have
become available due to reionization

which can be taken as a dividing line between the small-scale perturbations that have
been substantially modied by gravity and the large-scale inhomogeneities that have not
changed much The uctuations on large angular scales  cid29 1  arise from inhomo-
geneities with wavelengths exceeding the Hubble radius at recombination As a result
they provide pristine information about the primordial inhomogeneities On the other
hand sub-horizon perturbations are formed by primordial sound waves
The anisotropy of the CMB can be divided into two types primary anisotropy due to
effects which occur at the last scattering surface and earlier and secondary anisotropy
due to effects such as interactions of the CMB photons with hot gas or gravitational
potentials for example the Sunyaev-Zeldovich and integrated Sachs-Wolfe effects
between the last scattering surface and the observer The structure of the CMB primary
anisotropies is mainly determined by two effects acoustic oscillations and on small
angular scales photon diffusion also known as Silk damping Silk 1968 The photon
diffusion damping arises from the fact that the photon-baryon-electron PBE uid is
not tightly coupled and the photons can diffuse through the uid while the acoustic
oscillations result from the constructive and deconstructive interference Overdensities
in the dark matter compresses the uid due to their gravity until the rising pressure in
the coupled PBE uid is able to counteract gravity The cosmological importance of
this is that the PBE uid underwent acoustic oscillations while the dark matter being
decoupled did not
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
The density uctuations in the early Universe are assumed to be critical for structure
formation because they can provide the seeds from which the structures within the Uni-
verse can grow and eventually collapse to form the rst stars and galaxies eg Bromm
et al 1999 Barkana  Loeb 2001 Abel et al 2002 Bromm et al 2009 and refer-
ences therein The density perturbations of the early Universe are thought to have a
very specic character when ination is assumed they form a Gaussian random eld
Bardeen et al 1986 which is nearly scale-invariant according to the spectral index n
measured by WMAP Hinshaw et al 2009 Komatsu et al 2009 Dunkley et al 2009
Jarosik et al 2011 I will return to this in Section 25 where a more detailed discussion
of the initial density perturbations is presented
Power Spectrum of the CMB
To maximise the information a CMB map such as Fig 21 can provide the CMB
information is most often presented in the form of a power spectrum P in terms of the
angular scale or multipole moment l as shown in Figure 22 The power spectrum which
is a spherical harmonic transform3 of the CMB map and polarisation of the CMB radia-
tion provide a wealth of information see eg Tristram  Ganga 2007 for data analysis
methods for both constraining cosmological parameters Table 22 and for understand-
ing the formation of the large-scale structure in the Universe The CMB anisotropy is a
powerful cosmological probe because the parameters which determine the spectrum can
all be directly related to the basic cosmological parameters such as the energy densities
i the dark energy equation of state w and the Hubble parameter H
The general shape of the power spectrum Fig 22 - a plateau at large angular scales
small l and acoustic peaks at small angular scales large l - conrms that the spectrum
is predominantly nearly scale-invariant and adiabatic in agreement with the basic pre-
dictions of the Big Bang and inationary paradigm The dominant acoustic peaks in
the CMB power spectra are caused by the collapse of dark matter over-densities and the
oscillation of the photon-baryon uid into and out of these over-densities Lineweaver
2003 The underlying physical notion is that the pressure of photons can erase anisotropies
whereas the gravitational attraction of baryons makes them to collapse and to form
dense haloes As a result these effects can create acoustic oscillations which give the
CMB its characteristic peak structure see Fig 22 The rst acoustic peak is associ-
ated with perturbations on the scale of the sound horizon at the last scattering surface
l  200  1   100 Mpc while following peaks are on the scales less than the sound
horizon Combining the information about the heights and locations of the peaks many
cosmological parameters can be determined with good accuracy independent of other
observations such as galaxy surveys
3Fourier transformation is not possible on a sphere thus spherical harmonics which are analogous are
used instead

shows the predicted spectrum for the best-t at CDM model Section 241 The error bars on
the data points represent measurement errors while the shaded region indicates the uncertainty
in the model spectrum arising from cosmic variance Image from Jarosik et al 2011
222 Large galaxy surveys
The large galaxy surveys of today such as the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dFGRS
Colless 1999 Colless et al 2001 Percival et al 2001 and the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey SDSS York et al 2000 Stoughton et al 2002 Abazajian et al 2003 have pro-
vided large statistically signicant samples of different types of galaxies The ability to
explore many dimensions of galaxy properties and scaling relations simultaneously and
homogeneously has been greatly benecial Moreover spectroscopic observations and
multi-wavelength imaging allows galaxies to be sorted in classes and sub-populations by
eg morphology environment and luminosity while large sky coverage allows galaxies
to be grouped in groups and clusters enabling studies of galaxy evolution as a function
of environment eg Blanton  Berlind 2007 Mateus et al 2007 see also Chapter 4
However large galaxy surveys not only provide good statistics for galaxy properties but
they can also be used to study the large-scale structure and cosmology
Despite the fact that the CMB radiation is very smooth the visible Universe that
is dominated by the light from galaxies looks highly inhomogeneous and consists of
structures from the scales of isolated galaxies and voids through groups Chapter 3 and
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
clusters to superclusters and to large laments between them see Fig 23 One aim
of large galaxy redshift surveys is therefore to map the three dimensional distribution
of galaxies in order to understand the properties of this distribution and what it implies
about the contents and evolution of the Universe Because the topology of the distri-
bution of galaxies is closely related to the initial conditions of the Universe and to the
assumption that the initial perturbations were Gaussian uctuations with random phases
on large scales this mapping can also provide information concerning the conditions in
the early Universe independent from the CMB measurements Unfortunately the spatial
distribution of galaxies groups and clusters depends not only on the matter distribution
in the Universe but also on how they form in the matter density eld It is therefore im-
portant to understand galaxy formation Section 28 and evolution Chapter 4 in detail
when studying the clustering of galaxies
A representation of the large-scale distribution of galaxies on the sky in the 2dFGRS
is shown in Fig 23 From this gure alone it is obvious that galaxies form larger
structures such as clusters and laments and that the visible light is unevenly distributed
in the Universe even on relatively large scales Even though the distribution of galaxies
becomes smoother and smoother when larger and larger scales are considered non-
random structure is still present in forms of superclusters and laments between them
This non-random structure is sometimes called the cosmic web as the long laments of
dark and baryonic matter seem to form a threaded structure
The laments seen in large galaxy surveys are the largest known structures in the
Universe and can be up to  80  100h1Mpc4 long Einasto et al 1980 Batuski
 Burns 1985 White et al 1987 Bahcall 1988 Filaments are important structures
for galaxy formation as it is assumed that they are the channels that carry baryons to
the nodes of the laments where clusters of galaxies are formed Filaments can also
help cool gas to avoid shock-heating eg Dekel  Birnboim 2006 Dekel et al 2009a
Kere et al 2009 while over-densities in laments can form gravitationally bound dark
matter haloes There is however still a debate in how gas can enter and coalesce into dark
matter haloes and how it cools down to form stars and eventually galaxies see eg Kere
et al 2005 Kaufmann et al 2006 and references therein The exact role of laments
in the formation and evolution of galaxies is therefore currently unclear
While laments are the largest known structures superclusters eg Araya-Melo
et al 2009 are the largest non-percolating galaxy systems Oort 1983 Bahcall 1988
Einasto et al 2007 2008 Unlike super clusters the scales of the largest voids are in
general  30 to 50 times the scale of a regular relaxed cluster ie up to  50h1 Mpc
although the size measurements vary greatly Zeldovich et al 1982 Rood 1988 Vo-
geley et al 1994 Lindner et al 1995 El-Ad  Piran 1997 Hoyle  Vogeley 2004

Because of all the structure in the cosmic web the galaxy distribution seems to have
a sponge-like topology with both high- and low-density regions forming an intercon-
nected network where voids are separated from high-density regions by attened struc-
tures called walls This raises an obvious question how can we quantify the clustering
of different types of objects and what does this tell us about the formation of the large-
scale structure

Two-point correlation function and the power spectrum
Among the simplest methods to measure clustering properties of galaxies or of other ob-

from another object selected at random over that expected in a uniform random distri-
bution see Peebles 1980 for a complete discussion We can now write the probability
to nd galaxies in innitesimal small volumes dV1 and dV2 as follows
where n is the mean galaxy density In practise it is however often more convenient to
derive the two-point correlation function r using for example the Landy  Szalay

Large datasets provided by galaxy surveys have been used to study for example
the spatial correlation functions eg Connolly et al 2002 Scranton et al 2002 Zehavi
et al 2004 Masjedi et al 2006 clustering of matter galaxies eg Coil et al 2007 and
groups eg Coil et al 2006a in the Universe Consequently allowing to set constrains
for the structure formation and cosmological parameters Lahav  Suto 2004 Tegmark
et al 2004b In galaxy surveys redshifts of galaxies are usually used as distances thus
the correlation function is said to work in redshift-space However because of peculiar
velocities5 an isotropic distribution in real-space will appear anisotropic in redshift-
space and vice versa The redshift-space correlation function therefore differs from the
real-space correlation function This effect is known as the redshift-space distortion for
observational studies see eg Hamilton 1998 Tegmark et al 2004a It is important to
note that redshift-space distortions due to peculiar velocities along the line of sight will
introduce systematic effects to the estimate of r For example at small separations
random motions within a virialized overdensity cause an elongation along the line of
sight dubbed as ngers of God On the other hand on large scales coherent infall
of galaxies into forming structures causes an apparent contraction of structure along the
line of sight dubbed as the Kaiser effect
On scales smaller than  10h1 Mpc the real-space correlation function is well
approximated by a power law

r 
where the slope   18 and r0  5h1 Mpc is the correlation length This shows that
galaxies are strongly clustered on scales  5h1 Mpc and the amplitude of clustering
becomes weak on scales much larger than  10h1 Mpc Note however that the exact
values of  and r0 are found to depend on the properties of the galaxies Particularly
brighter and redder galaxies are more strongly clustered than fainter and bluer ones Nor-
berg et al 2001 Zehavi et al 2005 Coil et al 2006b Wang et al 2008 Additionally
early-type galaxies have been found to be much more clustered on small scales leading
to a morphology-density relation Peacock 2002 see also Chapter 4
The galaxy correlation function is a measure of the degree of clustering in either the
spatial r or the angular distribution w of galaxies The spatial two-point corre-

Figure 24 shows a matter power spectrum at the present time According to the
gure on large scales small wave-numbers k  001h1 Mpc the current matter power
spectrum still has its primordial shape This shape corresponds to a power law depen-
dence on scale P k  kn where n is the so-called spectral index assumed to be close
to unity for theoretical background see Section 252 and for the reference value see
Table 22 The horizon scale at the epoch when the matter and radiation densities are
equal the matter-radiation equality zeq see Table 22 for a value is imprinted upon the
power spectrum as the scale at which the spectrum turns over Hence the peak position
in the spectrum corresponds to the Jeans length Eq 226 at matter-radiation equality I
will return to this in Section 25 The position of this turnover corresponds to a physical
scale determined by the matter mh2 and radiation densities rh2 Moreover the
shape of the observed power spectrum P k depends on the amount and the nature of
the matter in the Universe providing constrains for cosmology For example if all of
the dark matter were hot then the matter power spectrum would fall off sharply to zero
to the right of the peak
Large redshift surveys can be used not only to study the power spectrum of galaxy
clustering but also the presence of the acoustic oscillations of baryons eg Tegmark
et al 2004a Cole et al 2005 Eisenstein et al 2005 Percival et al 2007 The physics
of these oscillations are analogous to those of the CMB acoustic oscillations The am-
plitude of baryonic acoustic oscillations BAOs is however suppressed in comparison
to CMB because not all the matter in the Universe is composed of baryons In practise
many studies of BAOs have taken advantage of the clustering of luminous red galaxies
LRGs eg Padmanabhan et al 2007 Snchez et al 2009 The clustering of LRGs
also allows the values of cosmological parameters to be derived independently from the

CMB measurements Furthermore the observed power spectrum allows to constrain
on both the amplitude and the scale dependence of the galaxy bias eg Padmanabhan
et al 2007 This ultimately links the galaxy power spectrum to the matter power spec-
trum Despite this connection large galaxy surveys can provide constrains for structure
formation models independent of the CMB measurements
A viable structure formation model has to therefore simultaneously explain both the
smoothness of the CMB and the clear evidence from the galaxy surveys that the assump-
tions of isotropy and homogeneity do not hold on smaller scales but galaxies and other
inhomogeneities such as groups do form Moreover large galaxy surveys together with
23 DYNAMICS OF AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE
the CMB observations can be used to set strict constrains for cosmological parameters
see Section 241 and Table 22 Importantly these observations can provide informa-
tion about structures of different sizes and times from the recombination to the present
epoch A successful structure formation model must therefore be able to explain all the
current observations However before we start looking into structure formation models
in more detail some tools to study the dynamical evolution of an expanding universe
that is isotropic and homogeneous must be introduced In the following Sections I shall
give a minimalistic overview of the dynamics of an expanding universe on top of which
the structure formation theory can be build upon For more detailed treatment I refer the
interested readers to great textbooks of eg Peebles 1980 Dodelson 2003 Longair
2008 Mo et al 2010
23 Dynamics of an expanding universe
Being able to model the dynamical evolution of an expanding universe is a basic require-
ment for any structure formation model Because space-time can be curved and is not
static we must rely on General Relativity when deriving the equations that govern the
evolution of the background universe
231 Einstein equation
Einsteins General Relativity GR enabled self-consistent models of the Universe to be
constructed as it relates matter and energy to the geometrical properties of the Universe
In GR the gravity eld is described by Einsteins eld equation
  8GT 
 is the Einstein tensor G is Newtons gravitational constant and T 
where G
 is the
energy-momentum tensor Note that matter is incorporated in Einsteins equation through
the energy-momentum tensor On large scales matter can be approximated as a perfect
uid characterised by an energy density  pressure P and four velocity u Now the
energy-momentum tensor may be written as
    P uu  P 
where the equation of state P  P  depends on the properties of matter Often in
cosmologically interesting cases P  constant   or more general as in Eq 216
Equation 28 shows that in GR the strength of the gravitational eld depends not only on
the energy density  but also on the pressure P 
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
It is also possible to write the Einstein equation in a form that explicitly shows the
cosmological constant  now
  R
  1
 R  
 is the Ricci tensor R is the scalar curvature  is the cosmological constant
where R
and  is the unit tensor6 dened by the metric such that gg  
  As the cosmo-
logical constant can be interpreted as the contribution of vacuum energy to the Einstein
equation it can also be included in the energy-momentum tensor
According to the Cosmological Principle Milne 1933 the Universe is homoge-
neous and isotropic at least on large enough scales thus space-time can be described by
the Robertson-Walker metric
ds2  c2dt  a2t
cid18 dr2
cid19
1  Kr2  r2d2  sin2 d2
where the spatial positions are described by spherical coordinates r   c is the speed
of light and at is the scale factor The scale factor and the changing scale of the
Universe causes the cosmological redshift z which can be dened as
Here at0 is the present value of the scale factor and atem is the value of the scale
factor at the time when the light was emitted As a result the redshift z can be used
to parameterise the history of the Universe a given z corresponds to a time when our
Universe was 1  z times smaller than now The importance of the metric 210 is that
it allows to dene the invariant interval ds2 between events at any epoch or location in
an expanding universe and thus determines the metric Riemann and Ricci curvature
tensors
The Einstein equation describes the geometry of space which is curved by matter and
energy It is also the basic equation of GR that the dynamical variables characterising
the gravitational eld must follow The cosmological evolution of relativistic matter can
therefore be derived from the Einstein equation 27 when the metric of the space-time
and the energy-momentum tensor are xed
232 Friedmann equations
Alexander Friedmann was the rst to derive a pair of equations that can describe the
expansion rate of a homogeneous and isotropic universe The rst Friedmann equation
6Note that later in this Chapter  will refer to the density perturbation eld
23 DYNAMICS OF AN EXPANDING UNIVERSE
can be derived directly from Einsteins eld equation 27 which can be simplied
using the Robertson-Walker metric Eq 210 Now Friedmanns rst equation can be
written as
where G is Newtons gravitational constant K is the spatial curvature 1 or 0  is
the sum over all energy densities eg baryons photons neutrinos dark matter and dark
energy and H is the Hubble parameter that describes the rate of the expansion
Here a denotes the time derivative of the scale factor Note that the dynamical content
of the metric is encoded in the function Ha t Friedmanns second equation can be
derived from the trace of Einsteins eld equation and can be written as
cid18
cid19
  4G
Now the a is the second time derivative of the scale factor and P is the pressure
The importance of the two Friedmann equations 212 and 214 is that they de-
termine the two unknown functions the scale factor at and the energy density t
Consequently the Friedmann equations can describe the dynamics of a homogeneous
isotropic and expanding universe because the scale factor completely describes the time
evolution of such a universe The Friedmann equations therefore determine the expan-
sion rate of the Universe based on the density of material within it and the curvature
of space Note that a Robertson-Walker metric 210 whose scale factor a satises
Friedmanns equations is called the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric and
the cosmological standard model upholds that the Universe at large is described by such
a metric
Construction of a cosmological model requires solving the Friedmann equations
resulting to the expansion rate as a function of time and hence the size of the Uni-
verse However solving the Friedmann equations alone is not enough for a cosmologi-
cal model it is also essential to know how the energy density  changes as a function of
233 Evolution of energy density the uid equation
The evolution of energy density in an expanding universe can be described with the
so-called uid equation The uid equation which holds only for adiabatic processes
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
can be obtained from the Friedmanns equations when equation 214 is rewritten using
equation 212 resulting in
cid18
cid19
  3
where  denotes the energy density and P is the pressure as dened earlier The uid
equation expresses the conservation of mass-energy thus it is also known as the energy
conservation or the continuity equation The second term in the uid equation corre-
sponds to the loss in energy because the pressure of the material has done work as the
volume of the Universe increased However because the energy is conserved the energy
lost from the uid via the work done goes into gravitational potential energy To gen-
eralise for an adiabatically expanding volume the entropy per unit co-moving volume
is conserved and the expansion of the Universe causes an increase or decrease of its
internal energy depending on whether the pressure P is smaller or larger than zero
For a given equation of state P  the uid equation gives the density and pressure
as a function of the scale factor a The equation of state which describes the energy
content of the Universe is often parametrized with wi in the following way
Pi  wiic2
Here the subscript i denotes the species of the material Note however that this so-
called perfect uid hypothesis holds only for material whose pressure is directly related
to its density Finally if w is time-independent then substituting Eq 216 into 215 gives
the time evolution of the mean energy density of the Universe as follows
i  a31wi
The uid equation together with the equation of state allow the derivation of the mean
energy density temperature and pressure of the Universe at any redshift from their values
at the present time At early times the Universe is assumed to be radiation dominated thus
we can approximate that the energy content of the Universe is dominated by an ultra-
relativistic radiation uid for which wrad  1
3 As a result the mean energy density
evolves proportional to a4 After the nucleosynthesis but before the recombination
at zeq  31967 the densities of non-relativistic matter and relativistic radiation are
equal However after this point the Universe turns into a matter dominated Now a non-
relativistic gas can be approximated with a uid of zero pressure8 and we take wmat  0
As a consequence the mean energy density evolves  a3 Finally at recent epochs
7The exact time depends on the matter density of the Universe and the Hubble constant The redshift
given is for the reference values see Table 22
8sometimes referred to as dust
24 INGREDIENTS OF STRUCTURE FORMATION
the energy density seems to have become dominated by vacuum energy
In order to
keep a constant energy density as the Universe expands the pressure must be negative
therefore for vacuum energy we take wvac  1 Note that w  1 can also be taken
for the cosmic ination
Table 21 summarises the evolution of energy density pressure and temperature as
a function of the scale parameter a Note however that these scaling relations only hold
if the equation of state remains constant with respect to time while in reality such a
simplication may not hold on all times It should also be kept in mind that although the
contribution of baryons and photons to the present day energy budget is small they make
an important contribution to shaping the matter power spectrum Moreover in realistic
cases the Universe is not made out of a single material component as presented above
Fortunately each material baryons photons dark matter neutrinos dark energy etc
obey their own uid equation containing the appropriate expression for its pressure if the
uids are non-interacting One can therefore take a linear combination of the terms and
substitute that into the Friedmann equations in case of more realistic models

24 Ingredients of structure formation
The ultimate goal of a structure formation theory is to describe how the phase transi-
tion progressed from almost perfectly homogeneous initial elds to all the structure we
observe To get closer to achieving this goal - to model the formation of structure in
an evolving background universe - we must next concentrate on small density perturba-
tions A realistic structure formation model must be able to describe the evolution of the
density eld in the Universe with time when the eld contains small uctuations The
usual approach is to model the uctuations as a perturbation to a smooth background
which we assume is homogeneous and isotropic
The key idea of any structure formation model is that if there are small perturbations
ie uctuations in the energy density of the early Universe then gravitational instability
can amplify them leading to virialized structures such as the galaxies groups and clus-
ters we observe today To model the formation of structure in a realistic self-consistent
and physical way several ingredients are required Coles  Lucchin 2002
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
I a background cosmology Section 23
II an initial uctuation spectrum Section 252
III a choice of uctuation mode and a statistical distribution of uctuations
IV a Transfer function Section 253
V a recipe for the nonlinear evolution Sections 26 and 27 and
VI a prescription to relate mass uctuations to observable light Section 28
As can be seen from the comprehensive list above detailed modelling of structure for-
mation involves several different ingredients All of which interact in a complicated
manner To complicate the matter even further most of the above items involve one or
more assumptions see eg Coles  Lucchin 2002 It should however be kept in mind
that most of the assumptions are physically motivated albeit this does not exclude the
possibility that they are inaccurate or even incorrect
Figure 25 shows a logical ow chart describing the formation of structure The
chart shows how structures start to form from small initial density eld uctuations after
the Big Bang and proceed through various steps to galaxy formation and to the mat-
ter power spectrum observed for example in large galaxy surveys Section 222 At
present the physical mechanism that can best describe the initial density eld is ina-
tion Guth 1981 Mukhanov  Chibisov 1981 Linde 1982 Narlikar  Padmanabhan
1991 The initial conditions of the Universe are thought to arise from the scale-invariant
quantum-mechanical zero-point uctuations of the scalar eld that drove the ination in
the very early Universe Guth  Pi 1982 Hawking 1982 Baumann 2007 Ination
predicts for example that the initial uctuations are adiabatic ie perturbations are
in thermal equilibrium and behave as a Gaussian random eld with a nearly scale in-
variant spectrum
In the following Sections I will therefore concentrate on adiabatic
uctuations with a Gaussian random phase and leave out isocurvature perturbations and
non-Gaussian random elds this is the structure formation ingredient III
The rst ingredient of the structure formation describes the global evolution of the
background universe Section 23 and is usually done using Friedmann equations Sec-
tion 232 The rest of the ingredients are related to the formation and evolution of
density perturbations under gravity in an expanding background universe These will be
described in the following sections in more detail the spectrum of the initial uctuations
and the Transfer function are discussed in Section 25 while the nonlinear evolution us-
ing both analytical methods and cosmological Nbody simulations is explored in Sec-
tions 26 and 27 respectively Finally to form realistic galaxies that can be compared to
the galaxies observed in large galaxy surveys at least hydrodynamics baryonic physics
and star formation eg McKee  Ostriker 2007 must be considered One realisation
for modelling gas star formation and feedback processes is the semi-analytical models

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
241 The  Cold Dark Matter model
The  Cold Dark Matter CDM -model is nowadays accepted by the majority of
astronomers as a standard model of Big Bang cosmology and cosmological structure
formation The success of CDM is widely recognised and is due to its simplicity
yet at the same time it has the capability to simultaneously explain several profound
observations of the Universe CDM can explain the structure and existence of the
cosmic microwave background the large-scale structure of galaxy groups and clusters
weak and strong gravitational lensing and the accelerated expansion of the Universe
inferred from type Ia supernovae observations eg Narlikar  Padmanabhan 2001
The statistical analysis of observations Section 22 strongly support the at CDM
cosmological model with the total energy density equal to the critical density Table 22
summarises the energy budget and the values of the basic CDM parameters based on
WMAP results Hinshaw et al 2009 Komatsu et al 2009 Dunkley et al 2009 Jarosik
et al 2011
The  term of the standard cosmology stands for the Einsteins cosmological con-
stant often assumed to be the vacuum energy of space and dubbed as dark energy due to
its unknown origin Narlikar  Padmanabhan 2001 Frieman et al 2008 The energy
budget of the model is dominated by this unknown dark energy the -term constitutes
almost 75 per cent of the total energy composition The remaining  25 per cent of
the energy budget is matter however about 85 per cent of the matter is assumed to be
in form of non-baryonic dark matter Because the dark matter particles are assumed to
be non-relativistic the dark matter is said to be cold The term cold dark matter was
introduced by Peebles and Richard Bond in 1982 to cover the wide range of particles
that were and have been suggested for the origin of this unknown gravitating material
Note that the coldness of the dark matter particles is actually required by the large-scale
structure hot dark matter ie relativistic particles does not predict enough structure on
small scales
The shape of the CDM power spectrum is such that structures form from smaller
to larger structures ie bottom-up with galaxies forming rst followed by the for-
mation of groups and clusters More general in all CDM-models independent of the
-term the initial density uctuations have larger amplitudes on smaller scales thus the
CDM-models are hierarchical larger structures form by clustering of smaller objects
via gravitational instability eg Davis et al 1985 Frenk et al 1988 White  Frenk
1991 Bullock et al 2001 In CDM-models the collapse of matter happens when a
local perturbation starts to turn around while the Universe is expanding The process of
collapsing continues until the internal velocity of systems components are large enough
to hold the system against more collapse As a result a dark matter halo is formed Note
that unlike baryonic matter the behaviour of dark matter does not depend on the scale of
the system since dark matter only interacts gravitationally Thus in the CDM-model

dark matter haloes with different sizes and masses are scaled versions of each other

Even though the CDM-model is widely accepted there are still many unknowns
For example several particle candidates exist for dark matter see eg Baltz 2004
Muoz 2004 Bertone et al 2005 however none has been observed thus far One
of the leading candidates for the dark matter particle is the lightest stable supersymmet-
ric particle called neutralino which is weakly interacting and massive but several other
candidates for example Axions exist Hence the type of the dark matter particles is yet
to be conrmed The nature of dark energy is even more mysterious though the leading
candidate is the vacuum energy of space Peebles  Ratra 1988 Frieman et al 2008
As both dark matter and energy reveal themselves only via gravity all attempts to detect
them directly have been unsuccessful thus far A signicant amount of work remains
therefore to be done before the formation of structure and cosmology can be considered
as fully understood
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
25 Evolution of initial perturbations structure formation
The present consensus in cosmology as seen in the previous Sections is that the ob-
served structures developed from small initial perturbations of the physical elds den-
sity velocity gravitational potential etc resulting from the instability of the Friedmann
models for small perturbations Hence to model structure formation we must model how
the density perturbation eld evolves A full treatment would require GR and would
proceed by perturbing the background metric and the energy-momentum tensor see eg
Weinberg 2008 However a fully relativistic treatment is beyond the scope of this in-
troduction to the formation of structure thus I will describe a Newtonian method which
gives an excellent approximation Even so it should be kept in mind that the following
analysis holds only for perturbations on scales much smaller than the Hubble radius ie
on sub-horizon scale because the Newtonian description assumes instantaneous gravity
ie the speed of gravity has been assumed to be innite
251 Growth of small perturbations in an expanding universe
The hierarchy of cosmic structures is assumed to have grown from primordial density
seed uctuations which can be described with the density contrast x t The density
contrast as a function of the co-moving coordinates x motivates the study of the density
perturbation eld It can be dened as
x t 
x t  t
t
where t is the mean density A critical feature of the  eld is that it inhabits a
universe that is isotropic and homogeneous in its large-scale properties
In order to describe the structure formation in an expanding universe we must follow
the evolution of the initial perturbation eld as a function of time while gravitation
magnies the perturbations in both the baryonic and dark matter distribution After
recombination the amplitude of the density uctuations is  103 Thus the onset of
structure formation happens well within the linear regime where  cid28 1 Consequently a
linear perturbation theory can be used as long as the density eld does not turn nonlinear
 cid38 1 for a comprehensive presentation see eg Coles  Lucchin 2002
On large scales matter can be described with a perfect uid approximation Thus
at any given time matter can be characterised by the energy density distribution x t
the entropy per unit mass Sx t and the vector eld of three-velocities vx t These
quantities satisfy the hydrodynamical equations that allow the study of the behaviour of
small perturbations in a homogeneous isotropic background The equations of motion
for a non-relativistic uid are the continuity Euler and Poisson equation The continu-
ity equation states that the change in the mass inside an element of the uid equals to
25 EVOLUTION OF INITIAL PERTURBATIONS STRUCTURE
FORMATION
the mass convected into the element ie it denes the conservation of mass On the
other hand the Euler equation states that the acceleration of a small uid element is
due to the difference in pressure acting on opposite sides of the element while the Pois-
sons equation describes the relation between the potential uctuations and the density
perturbations causing them
In their basic form see eg Coles  Lucchin 2002 Longair 2008 the continuity
Euler and Poisson equation hold for a smooth background However in this Section
we derive the evolution of the density perturbations and hence we must consider small
perturbations to the background All the quantities involved must be then written as
a sum of the smooth background and the perturbed quantity eg in case of pressure
P  P  P  Here P corresponds to the smooth background pressure eld while
P is a small perturbation to this smooth component The perturbed quantities can then
be substituted to the basic continuity Euler and Poisson equation After ignoring terms
higher than the rst order in the perturbation and subtracting the zero order equations
one obtains the linear perturbation forms of these equations Thus it is possible to de-
scribe the evolution of the density velocity potential and pressure elds in an expanding
universe with Newtonian gravity by using the perturbed continuity Euler and Poisson
equations together with the conservation of entropy for a full derivation see eg Pee-
bles 1980 Longair 2008 Mo et al 2010
The linear perturbation theory briey described above holds that during the matter-
dominated era the density eld  of sub-horizon perturbations can be described with the
growth equation as follows
2x t
t2  2Ht
x t
 4Gx t 
2x t
Here Ht is the Hubble parameter dened in Eq 213 cs is the speed of sound 
denotes the differentials with respect to co-moving coordinates and 
t is a partial time
derivative The above second-order growth equation has been written in a general9 but
single-uid form as a function of cosmic time t and co-moving coordinate x This gives
a linear approximation for the growth of density perturbations in an expanding universe
Note that the second term on the left-hand side is the so-called Hubble drag term which
tends to suppress perturbation growth due to the expansion of the Universe On the
other hand the rst term on the right-hand side is the gravitational term which causes
perturbations to grow via gravitational instability while the last term on the right-hand
side is a pressure term and is due to the spatial variations in density
The solution to the growth equation 219 apply to the evolution of a single Fourier
mode of the density eld However in the linear regime the equations governing the
evolution of the perturbations are all linear in perturbation quantities It is then useful
9Setting cs  0 gives the often shown form of the growth equation

to expand the perturbation elds in chosen mode functions If the curvature K of the
Universe can be neglected the mode function can be chosen to be plane waves Now the
perturbation elds can be represented by their Fourier transforms We therefore seek a
wave solution for  of the form
x t 
kteikx
We can now write a wave equation for  after taking a Fourier transform of equation
219 Because each k mode is assumed to evolve independently we can write
k  2H k 
 4G
k  0 
The equation 221 sometimes called the Jeans equation describes the evolution of each
of the individual modes kt corresponding to x t Note that because x in Eq
219 is in co-moving units the wave-vectors k are also and that the derivatives denoted
by dots are time derivatives because k does not explicitly depend on a spatial position
If the dark matter is cold and collisionless we can neglect the pressure term in Eq
221 This allows us to write a general solution in a form of two linearly independent
power laws ie
kt  A1Dk t  A2Dk t
where A1 and A2 are constants to be determined by initial conditions The growth or
Jeans equation therefore has two solutions a growing  and decaying  mode The
latter is hardly interesting for structure formation thus hereafter we concentrate on the
growing mode The growing mode is described by the growth factor D dened such
that the density contrast at the time t is related to the density contrast today t0 by
t  t0
It is useful to note that the solution to equation 221 can either grow or decrease
depending on the sign of the

We can now write 225 in terms of the physical wavelength using the simple relation
k  2a1 and by doing so obtain the Jeans length

J  cs
which denes a scale length on which structures can grow In general on scales smaller
than the Jeans length ie   J or k  kJ  the solution to the Jeans equation
corresponds to a sinusoidal sound wave so pressure can counter gravity Due to the
damping caused by the Hubble drag term there is no growth of structure for sub-Jeans
scales but the solution is oscillatory Instead on scales longer than the Jeans length but
smaller than the horizon the pressure can no longer support the gravity and the solution
can grow As the Jeans length is time dependent in an expanding universe for example
before the recombination J  2500 Mpc while after the Jeans length is only  10
kpc a given mode  may switch between periods of growth and stasis governed by the
evolution of J But what does all this mean for the growth of perturbations
The growth rate of a density perturbation depends on epoch or more precisely on
what component dominates the global expansion whether a perturbation k-mode is
super- or sub-horizon and the Jeans length As already noted in the case of the evolu-
tion of the energy density Section 233 the early Universe was assumed to be radiation
dominated until the time of matter-radiation equality zeq During the epoch of radiation
domination the Universe can be taken as at and for k  0 the growth equation can
be solved by   tn for a detailed derivation see eg Coles  Lucchin 2002 Thus
for all perturbations the growing mode here we ignore the decaying mode outside the
horizon on super-horizon scales grows as   t  a2 Instead on the sub-horizon10
scales the cold and collisionless dark matter which has no pressure cs  0 of its own
and is not coupled to photons grows at most logarithmically dm  lna After the
matter-radiation equality matter begins to dominate the dynamics On the super-horizon
scale all perturbations dark matter baryons and photons grow as   a Dark matter
being pressureless grows with the same rate dm  a  t

 Lucchin 2002 also on sub-horizon scales However baryons are still coupled to the
radiation until the time of decoupling zcid63 As a result the sub-horizon perturbations in
the baryons cannot grow but instead oscillate Finally at the time of decoupling zcid63 the
rate of collisional ionization does not dominate any longer and the baryons can decouple
from the photons At this point the baryonic perturbations can start to grow as  a  t
on scales   J On the smaller scales they instead continue to oscillate Finally at
the latest times when the -term is assumed to be dominant the growing mode solution
is  constant

always close to the size of the horizon

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
Note however that in general the presentation in this Section applies only to adi-
abatic perturbations in a non-relativistic uid with a single component Fortunately
though the Newtonian perturbation theory is valid even with the presence of relativistic
energy components such as radiation and dark energy as long as they can be considered
smooth and their perturbations can be ignored In this case they contribute only to the
background solution
252 Statistical description of the initial uctuations
In the previous Section an equation 219 describing the evolution of the density pertur-
bation eld Eq 218 was presented However as was noted it is often convenient to
consider the density perturbation eld by the superposition of many modes The natural
tool for achieving this is via Fourier analysis in case the co-moving geometry is at or
can be approximated as such Eq 221 In such case the power spectrum can be dened
P k  cid104k2cid105
where the angle brackets indicate an average As a result the power spectrum describes
how much the density eld varies on different scales Note that in an isotropic uni-
verse the density perturbation spectrum cannot contain any preferred direction Thus
we must have an isotropic power spectrum and we can write it simply as a function of
wave-number k rather than a vector Even with such simplication the power spectrum
provides a complete statistical characterisation of a particular kind of stochastic process
a Gaussian random eld Bardeen et al 1986
Thus the power spectrum can characterise the statistical properties of the cosmologi-
cal perturbations This is highly useful in order to be able to relate theory to observations
For example results of large galaxy surveys eg correlation functions Section 222
suggest that the spectrum of the initial uctuations must have been very broad with no
preferred scales Because power spectrum P k is related to a two-point correlation
function by a Fourier transform Eqs 23 and 24 it is then natural to assume that the
power spectrum of the initial uctuations generated in the early phases of the Big Bang
is of a power-law form Thus
P k  Akn
where A is the amplitude k is a wave-number in physical units h1Mpc and n is a free
parameter Hence the power spectrum also describes the normalisation of the spectrum
of density perturbations on large physical scales
Because there is yet no theory for the origin of the cosmological perturbations the
amplitude A of the power spectrum has to be xed by observations The amplitude A

is therefore set using either the so-called COBE normalisation11 eg Bunn  White
1997 or by the variance of the density uctuations within spheres of 8h1 Mpc radius
8 for the reference model value see Table 22 The 8 parameter can be measured for
example using the cosmic-shear autocorrelation function the abundance and evolution
of the galaxy-cluster population the statistics of Lyman- forest lines Seljak et al
2006 or by counting the number of hot X-ray emitting clusters in the local universe
see eg Bartelmann 2010 and references therein
According to equation 26 the power-law form of the power spectrum
P k  kn
corresponds to a two-point correlation function of form
The mass M within a uctuation is  r3 thus the spectrum of a mass uctuation is
r  rn3
M   M
n3
Finally the root-mean-square rms density uctuation at mass scale M can be written

rms  M
As can be seen from the equations above the spectral index n has a signicant role in
the structure formation If n cid54 1 the power spectrum is called tilted a tilted spectrum
is called red if n  1 and blue if n  1 for a review see eg Abbott  Wise 1984
Lucchin  Matarrese 1985 A red spectrum shows that there is more structure at large
scales while a blue spectrum describes that there is more structure at small scales The
special case is found when the spectral index n equals unity
The Harrison-Zeldovich power spectrum
Simple inationary theories predict that right after ination the matter power spec-
trum would have a simple power-law form Consequently the primordial or Harrison-
Zeldovich Harrison 1970 Zeldovich 1972 power spectrum can be written as P k 
Akn with the spectral index n equals unity The simple power-law form P k  Ak
now results the spectrum of density perturbations to have a following form

11In the COBE normalisation the amplitude of the large scale temperature anisotropies in the CMB are
used to constrain the amplitude
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
while the two-point correlation function takes the form
r  r4
The importance of the Harrison-Zeldovich spectrum is the property that it is scale-
invariant the density contrast M  had the same amplitude  104 on all scales
when the perturbations came through their particle horizons during the radiation dom-
inated era
Interestingly the scale-invariant spectrum corresponds to a metric that is
a fractal leading to a fractal nature of the Universe eg Jones et al 1988 Balian 
Schaeffer 1989
The current large-scale observations see Section 222 and the citations therein are
reasonably well t by an n  1 scale-invariant primordial spectrum of perturbations
Theoretically the spectral index n would be precisely unity if ination lasts forever As
this is obviously not the case the spectral index must however deviate slightly from the
unity It can be shown for a detailed discussion see Liddle  Lyth 2000 that n must
be slightly smaller than unity in agreement with the CDM -model value ns in Table
22 It can also be shown that the spectral index of the temperature uctuations Fig
21 as a function of angular scale depends only upon the spectral index n of the initial
power spectrum Thus for the Harrison-Zeldovich power spectrum the amplitude is
independent of the angular scale
253 The Transfer function
If we wish to model how the form of the power spectrum evolves as a function of time
the statistical description of the initial uctuations described by the initial power spec-
trum P0k must be evolved During the evolution the form can be modied by several
physical phenomena For example radiation and relativistic particles can cause kine-
matic suppression of growth of the initial perturbations Moreover the imperfect cou-
pling of photons and baryons may also cause dissipation of perturbations On the other
hand gravity will amplify the perturbations and eventually leads to collapsed and bound
structures Thus real power spectra result from modication of any primordial power
by a variety of processes growth under self-gravity the effects of pressure and dissi-
pative processes In general however modes of short wavelengths have their amplitude
reduced relative to those of long wavelengths
A possible way to quantify how the shape of the initial power spectrum is modied
by different physical processes as a function of time is to use a simple function of a
wave-number namely the Transfer function T k For statistically homogeneous initial
Gaussian uctuations the shape of the original power spectrum is changed by physical
processes and the processed power spectrum P k is related to its primordial form P0k
via the Transfer function as follows
P k t  cid104k t2cid105  P0kT 2kD2
25 EVOLUTION OF INITIAL PERTURBATIONS STRUCTURE
FORMATION
Here Dt is the solution of the linearised density perturbations equation 221 ie
the growth factor Hence once the Transfer function is known one can calculate the
post-recombination power spectrum from the initial conditions
The form of the Transfer function is a function of the amount and type of the dark
matter particles As Section 241 described the currently favoured dark matter particles
are non-relativistic Damping processes can also effect T k during the linear evolution
As noted already the cold dark matter does not suffer from strong dissipation but on
scales less than the horizon size at matter-radiation equality there is a kinematic sup-
pression of growth on small scales Additional complication to the form of the Transfer
function arises from having a mixture of matter both collisionless dark matter and bary-
onic plasma and relativistic particles collisional photons and collisionless neutrinos
One more complication for the shape of the Transfer function arises from the fact that
sub-horizon perturbations grow differently during the radiation and matter dominated
eras Section 251 Due to the complicated form of the Transfer function it there-
fore must in general be calculated using an approximation formula eg by Bond 
Efstathiou 1984 Bardeen et al 1986 or more precisely numerically using publicly
available programs such as CMBfast12 Seljak  Zaldarriaga 1996
254 Evolution of the initial power spectrum to the present time
Section 22 showed that the current matter power spectrum is far from its initial form
even though at scales   1000h1 Mpc a Harrison-Zeldovich power law is a good
approximation Thus if one assumes that the initial power spectrum has a Harrison-
Zeldovich form after the ination it must have evolved signicantly As described
above the Transfer function can describe how the shape of the initial power spectrum
evolves through the epochs of horizon crossing and radiation-matter equality For the
largest scales cid29 10h1 Mpc the perturbations are still small even today and one can
use the Transfer function However for smaller scales such as galaxies groups and
clusters the inhomogeneities have become so large at later times z  100 that the
physics of structure growth has become nonlinear
The caveats in mind we can still provide an approximation for the form of the
present-day power spectrum If the mass uctuations inside the co-moving horizon ra-
dius at matter-radiation equality are independent of time and assuming that the dark
matter is cold the present day power spectrum can be approximated with a functional

CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
agreement with Figure 24 however the real power spectrum has a smooth maximum
which is caused by the different rates of growth before and after the matter-radiation
equality Note that the co-moving wave-number describes the location of the peak and
is set by the co-moving horizon radius at matter-radiation equality The steep decline
for structures smaller than the horizon radius reects the suppression of structure growth
during radiation domination
The evolution of the matter power spectrum from its initial to the current form see
Fig 24 can be summarised as follows Before the matter-radiation equality the mat-
ter distribution followed mostly that of the radiation Because radiation has signicant
pressure perturbations were forced to oscillate on sub-horizon scales Instead the largest
perturbations were too large for radiation pressure to be able to hold back the collapse
thus perturbations on scales larger than the horizon scale were able to grow with the
rate given in Section 25 This caused the matter power spectrum to increase in height
and started to induce a bump at small scales larger k As the times went on the hori-
zon scale increased and larger scales were able to oscillate causing the bump to shift
to larger scales smaller k Instead after matter-radiation equality zeq the dark matter
was able to grow with a rate given in Section 25 Because the dark matter is assumed
to be cold and collisionless it does not have signicant pressure and hence there were
practically no more acoustic oscillations During the matter dominated epoch the lack
of pressure in dark matter allows it to continue to collapse causing the whole of the
matter power spectrum to increase As a result the turn-over point of the matter power
spectrum is frozen into the power spectrum which corresponds to the co-moving hori-
zon radius at matter-radiation equality Finally closer to the current time the small scale
perturbations high k have turned nonlinear Consequently their growth is fast causing
the matter power spectrum to rise on smaller scales Quantitatively such an evolution
has been noted to lead to the current form of the matter power spectrum
Unfortunately the power spectrum can only describe the statistical properties of the
density contrast not the evolution of the individual density uctuations As a result the
evolution of individual perturbations as well as the nonlinear evolution on small scales
must be studied using some other techniques In such a case one must resort to for
example analytical techniques or cosmological N-body simulations
26 Nonlinear evolution I Analytical methods
As the density contrast  Eq 218 approaches unity the evolution of the density uc-
tuations becomes nonlinear In the course of nonlinear evolution overdensities contract
causing matter to ow from larger to smaller scales causing the power spectrum to de-
form Even though the linear perturbation theory Section 251 fails for  cid38 1 the
onset of nonlinear evolution can still be described analytically
26 NONLINEAR EVOLUTION I ANALYTICAL METHODS
261 Spherical top-hat model
The simplest analytical model for the nonlinear evolution of a discrete perturbation is
called the spherical top-hat model for a textbook review see eg Padmanabhan 1993
In this approximation the perturbation evolves according to Birkhoffs theorem in a
spherically symmetric situation matter external to the sphere will not inuence its evo-
lution An evolving density perturbation will therefore eventually stop expanding turns
around and collapses Because in this model the perturbation has no internal pressure it
collapses to innite density Interpreting this literally leads to a conclusion that all spher-
ical perturbations would result to black holes In reality this however has obviously not
happened and thus one should be aware of its limitations
In the spherical top-hat model a perturbation reaches a maximum size rmax at the
time of a turnaround tturn According to the model the perturbation will then collapse
at 2tturn In a realistic case during the collapse the gravitational potential energy must
be converted into kinetic energy of the particles involved in the collapse because a col-
lisionless system cannot dissipate energy This can be achieved for example via the
process of violent relaxation Lynden-Bell 1967 The collapsed object will therefore
eventually relax to a structure supported by random motions and satisfy the virial theo-
rem in which the internal kinetic energy of the system is equal to half of its gravitational
potential energy see Section 352 and equation 314
If one assumes that the relaxed object virialises at tvir  2tturn then a mean over-
density within a virial radius rvir  rmax2 can be derived using the virial theorem
The mean overdensity vir within the virial radius at the time of virialisation can now
be written as
cid18 rmax
cid193  1 
vir 
tturn
tturn
tturn
tvir
where t is the background density at time t In the case of a non-zero cosmological
constant and for a at universe an approximation for the mean overdensity can be written
vir  182  82x  39x2
mtvir
where x  mtvir  1 Bryan  Norman 1998 This simple approximation can
be used to derive an average density of a virialized object formed through gravitational
collapse in an expanding universe In the simplest approximation m  1 this leads
to vir  182  178 Note also that the virial theorem and the spherical collapse
model can also be used to estimate the redshift at which the object became virialized
One of the shortcomings of the spherical top-hat model is however the assumption
that the perturbations were exactly spherically symmetric Hence a more general ap-
proximation should be considered
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
262 Zeldovich approximation
Given the fact that uctuations of early times were small it is reasonable to assume that
at later epochs only the growing mode has a signicant amplitude Now if one assumes
that the density eld grows self-similarly with time the onset of nonlinear evolution
can be described by the so-called Zeldovich approximation ZelDovich 1970 The
Zeldovich approximation is a form of the linear perturbation theory and is applicable
to a pressureless uid The basic assumptions of the Zeldovich approximation are as
follows 1 the scales of interest are much smaller than the size of horizon 2 the uni-
verse is dominated by the matter component and 3 the curvature of the universe is zero
The Zeldovich approximation does therefore not assume spherical symmetry like the
top-hat model
The Zeldovich approximation is a Lagrangian description for the growth of pertur-
bations and it species the growth of structure by giving the displacement and the pe-
culiar velocity of each mass element in terms of the initial position ZelDovich 1970
Shandarin  Zeldovich 1989 Furthermore the Zeldovich approximation is a kine-
matic approximation by nature particle trajectories are straight lines The rst nonlinear
structures to form in this approximation will be two-dimensional sheets also called the
Zeldovich pancakes However the approximation is not valid after the formation of the
pancakes when shell crossing will start to occur Thus other techniques to follow the
evolution of density perturbations further into the nonlinear regime are required
263 The Press-Schechter formalism
The Press-Schechter PS Press  Schechter 1974 theory which was derived heuris-
tically using the linear growth theory and the spherical top-hat model Section 261
provides an analytical description for the evolution of gravitational structure in a hierar-
chical universe In the PS formalism an early universe is assumed to be well-described
by an isotropic random Gaussian eld of small density perturbations Moreover the
phases of uctuations are assumed to be random so that the eld is entirely dened by
its power spectrum Bower 1991 The basic idea of the PS theory is to imagine smooth-
ing the cosmological density eld at any epoch z on a given scale R so that the mass
scale of virialized objects of interest satises M  4
3 zR3 However as noted ear-
lier the growth of the density perturbations can only be followed with simple analytical
techniques until they become nonlinear The PS formalism circumvents this difculty by
assuming that the region collapses rapidly and independently of its surroundings once
it has turned nonlinear As a result the collapsed region can be described as a single
large body to the rest of the universe This simplication allows the linear equations to
be applied however one must still take into account the nonlinear single body objects
when modelling the formation of large-scale structure
27 NONLINEAR EVOLUTION II COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS 45
The PS formalism allows the modelling of the growth of cosmic structure in a highly
simplied universe Cole 1991 Perhaps more importantly it also allows to estimate
the mass function of the collapsed objects The PS formalism leads to a halo mass
function which has the form of a power law multiplied by an exponential While the
PS formalism gives a reasonable approximation to the numerical data it has been shown
to underestimate the number of massive systems while over-predicting the number of
typical mass objects eg Governato et al 1999 Sheth  Tormen 1999 Jenkins
et al 2001 Thus a more realistic and detailed modelling of the nonlinear growth of
structure in an expanding universe is required for more vigorous comparisons This can
be achieved for example by using numerical simulations
27 Nonlinear evolution II Cosmological simulations
271 Background
Cosmological N-body simulations provide a robust method to study large-scale struc-
ture and the formation and growth of cosmic structure of a universe on the nonlinear
regime This is possible because the equations of motions are integrated numerically
eg Springel et al 2001 and the references therein The basic idea of cosmological
simulations was founded in the 1960s and it owes its existence to early few body simu-
lations The rst cosmological simulations were run with a modest number of particles
and only the formation of a few galaxies were followed Instead today large cosmo-
logical simulations use billions of particles however many simulations still use pure
dark matter and no baryons To overcome the issue that in dark matter only simulations
galaxies must be placed by hand using eg semi-analytical methods Section 284 hy-
drodynamics can also be modelled Hydrodynamical simulations Katz  Gunn 1991
Navarro  Benz 1991 Katz 1992 Cen 1992 Rosswog 2009 that contain gas parti-
cles are gaining popularity with increasing computing power but their volumes are still
modest compared to dark matter only simulations Frenk et al 1999 Teyssier 2002
Sommer-Larsen et al 2003 Springel  Hernquist 2003 Dav et al 2010 Razoumov
 Sommer-Larsen 2010 Tantalo et al 2010 Moreover even in hydrodynamical sim-
ulations some key sub-grid physics such as star formation is not modelled directly
from the rst principles but using similar prescriptions as in semi-analytical models
Observations of the cosmic microwave background discussed in Section 221 show
that the perturbations of the gravitational potential are caused by non-relativistic material
eg Hu  Dodelson 2002 Therefore cosmological N-body simulations can usually
operate on Newtonian limit without the framework of General Relativity Even so the
expansion of the Universe must be taken into account This is often done using a co-
moving coordinate system which moves as a function of time as the Universe ages and
expands Consequently cosmological N-body simulation codes essentially follow the
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
evolution of the density eld  in an expanding background by following the motions of
particles caused via gravity by integrating the equations of motions numerically
The basic assumptions of a modern cosmological N-body simulation code can be
summarised as follows
 mass content of the Universe is build up mainly from dark matter
 gravity is the only notable force on large scales
 each dark matter particle in the simulation volume represents several particles of
the real Universe and they are collisionless
 a simulation starts from initial conditions with all modes well within the linear
regime
 periodic boundary conditions are adopted resulting in that no particle can be lost
during the simulation
These notions provide the basic assumptions that most simulations obey It is also note-
worthy that the assumption that the dark matter particles are collisionless also means
that the evolution of the Universe is driven by the mean gravitational potential rather
than two-body interactions In what follows I briey describe a general idea of generat-
ing initial conditions and how to follow the motions of particles
272 Setting up the initial conditions
For most galaxy formation and large-scale structure problems setting up the initial con-
ditions of a cosmological N-body simulation can be split into three parts
I generating a power spectrum
II generating a Gaussian random density eld using the power spectrum
III imposing density perturbation eld on the particle distribution
The rst step generation of a power spectrum denes the dark matter model The power
spectrum can be generated for example by taking a primordial power spectrum Sec-
tion 252 and then multiplying it with the Transfer function Section 253 of a chosen
cosmology The second step sets up a smooth distribution of particles for a technical
description see eg Martel 2005 by generating a single realisation of the density eld
in k-space The third step is to impose density perturbations with the desired characteris-
tics ie the assignment of displacements and velocities to particles A suitable particle
distribution ie a linear uctuation distribution can be generated using for example the
Zeldovich approximation Section 262 but see also Efstathiou et al 1985 Note that
27 NONLINEAR EVOLUTION II COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS 47
when following this technique the matter density and velocity uctuations are initialised
at the starting redshift chosen usually such that all modes in the simulation volume are
still within the linear regime
After the initial conditions have been set and the starting redshift has been chosen
the simulation can be evolved towards the current epoch by using a cosmological N-
body code In general the code allows the time evolution of the simulated particles to
be followed by integrating the equations of motions
273 Equations of motions
Several different techniques to follow the gravitational evolution of the density eld in
cosmological N-body simulations exist In this Section the basics are briey introduced
while more detailed descriptions of different techniques can be found from the literature
see eg Efstathiou et al 1985 Barnes  Hut 1986 Couchman 1991 Cen 1992 Xu
1995 Kravtsov et al 1997 Teyssier 2002 Aarseth 2003 Springel  Hernquist 2003
Bagla  Padmanabhan 1997 and references therein
In usual cases dark matter and stars if applicable can be modelled as a self-
gravitating collisionless uid in cosmological simulations Since the number of dark
matter particles is large two-body scattering events are assumed to be seldom As a
result it is convenient to describe the system in terms of the single particle distribution
function f  f x x t in phase space Now if we make a reasonable assumption that
there are no collisions between particles the evolution of the distribution function f of
the uid follows in the co-moving coordinates x the collisionless Boltzmann equation
 
 x
where the self-consistent potential  is the solution of Poissons equation
cid90
2r t  4G
f r x td x 
Here f r x t is the mass density of the single-particle phase space Unfortunately
though the coupled equation pair consisting of the collisionless Boltzmann and Poisson
equation is difcult to solve directly Thus simulations often follow the so-called N-
body approach where the smooth phase uid f is represented by N particles which are
integrated along the characteristic curves of the collisionless Boltzmann equation Con-
sequently the problem is conveniently reduced to a task of following Newtons equations
of motion for a large number of particles under their own self-gravity Springel et al
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
The dynamics of N particles can be described by the Hamiltonian

where xi and xj are the co-moving coordinate vectors the corresponding canonical
momenta are given by pi  a2mi xi and the x is the interaction potential Note that
the time dependency of the Hamiltonian H is caused by the time dependency in the
scale parameter a  at Before the equations of motions of simulated particles can be
derived the interaction potential has to be solved When periodic boundary conditions
are assumed the interaction potential can be solved from equation

where L is the side length of the simulation volume n  n1 n2 n3 and  is the

solved the Hamiltons equations of motions
  p
can be derived To follow the time evolution of the simulated particles the derived equa-
tions of motions must be integrated after making a small variation t to time via eg
the leapfrog integration scheme eg Dolag et al 2008 Note that in most cases the
particle motion integrals are time-integrals and require integrating the scale parameter
Identifying dark matter haloes
Far in the nonlinear regime towards the end of a simulation run bound structures start
to form for an example see Fig 26 After their formation they grow in mass either
by accretion or by merging with other bound structures These bound structures can be
identied from simulations by using the so-called halo nders that search for collections
of dark matter particles that are gravitationally bound The bound structures of particles
are called dark matter haloes due to their relatively spherical nature
The most popular algorithm to identify virialized haloes is likely the so-called Friends-
of-Friends halo nder Davis et al 1985 This simple algorithm links all particles with
distances less than a linking length to a single halo In general the linking length is
27 NONLINEAR EVOLUTION II COSMOLOGICAL SIMULATIONS 49
set to correspond to the mean virialisation overdensity vir Eq 236 derived using
the spherical top-hat model Section 261 The linear linking length of the Friends-of-
Friends halo nder is a free parameter often taken to be a fraction eg 02 of the mean
particle separation For other halo nding algorithms see for example Eisenstein  Hut

references therein

275 Resolution effects
The simplied scheme of collisionless particles used in cosmological N-body simula-
tions leads to nite mass- and force-resolution In an ideal case the number of simulation
particles should be as large as possible to enable a detailed study of formation and growth
of cosmic structure in all scales ranging from the smallest dwarf galaxies to the largest
clusters and laments However in reality this choice is in general limited by the avail-
able computing resources Moreover the number of particles must also be balanced with
the choice of a simulation volume size to compete against the cosmic variance
The mass resolution Rm of a simulation can be derived when the simulation volume
and the number of dark matter particles have been chosen The mass resolution in units
of solar mass Mcid12 describes the mass of a single dark matter particle and can be derived
Here L is the side length of the simulation volume in Mpc N is the number of particles
in the volume L3 and C  7496 1010 is a constant Note that the mass resolution sets
a hard limit no object below the mass resolution can form in a simulation In reality
however the smallest structures to form and which are identiable must be made out of
several tens of particles This renders the effective mass resolution at least an order of
magnitude worse than indicated by equation 243 Furthermore a nite mass resolution
also limits the ability to study the internal structures of dark matter haloes with masses
close to the resolution limit
On the other hand a nite force resolution arises from the fact that the gravitational
force between two particles diverges as their distance approaches to zero In reality

however the gravitational force between two extended objects is nite The force reso-
lution which is more subtle effect than mass resolution is more complicated to quantify
because it depends on the simulation code used In a mesh-based simulation code the

algorithms the force softening is often applied articially by modifying Newtons grav-
ity law by writing it as
r2  2
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
where M is the mass of a single particle r is the distance between the two particles and
 is the gravitational softening length Non-zero softening length now guarantees that
the force does not diverge even when r  0 However by doing so the  simultaneously
sets a limit for the highest density contrast that can be resolved
28 Galaxy formation and evolution
281 Background
So far I have briey shown how the formation and growth of large scale dark matter
structure can be modelled from the CMB down to the current epoch However observa-
tions such as large galaxy surveys Section 222 cannot yet directly probe dark matter
thus one should also try to model the luminous component or baryonic matter ie the
galaxy formation and evolution A detailed discussion of the theory of galaxy formation
is however beyond the scope of this introduction Instead in what follows I try briey
to summarise the main concepts of galaxy formation illustrated in Figure 28 to pro-
vide background for the following chapters For more detailed presentations I refer the
interested reader to the great text books of Longair 2008 and Mo et al 2010
The previous sections showed how to model dark matter haloes If we now assume
that galaxies form and reside in dark matter haloes it becomes obvious that the properties
of the galaxy population are related to the cosmological density eld and to the dark
matter halo population One can therefore try to link the properties of dark matter haloes
to the properties of observed galaxies by using statistical arguments As a result it
can be shown that the properties of the galaxy population depend on the properties of
the dark matter halo and subhalo populations see eg Mo et al 2010 for detailed
discussion This allows for example the galaxy luminosity function to be compared to
the dark matter halo mass function The correspondence of light and mass is important
for example when the mass power spectrum is being derived from observations Section
222 because a correlation between the observed light and the underlying mass must
be assumed
282 Linking halo mass to galaxy luminosity
To overcome the difculty of linking dark matter haloes to luminous galaxies Vale 
Ostriker 2004 see also Oguri 2006 proposed that a galaxys luminosity can be related
to its host dark matter halos virial mass Mvir via a simple relation as follows

28 GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION
where q p r and s are free parameters and M11 is scaled such that
1011h1Mcid12
However Cooray  Milosavljevic 2005 showed that the relation between the mass of
a dark matter halo and the luminosity of the galaxy it hosts is not straightforward due to
the complicated baryonic physics involved
The baryonic content of a dark matter halo becomes dynamically important in the
nonlinear regime when dark matter haloes are forming Consequently to model realistic
galaxies such as the Galaxy we live in baryons must be modelled albeit they do not
contribute to the structure formation as much as dark matter Hydrodynamical effects
such as heating and cooling processes of gas shocks star formation and feedback pro-
cesses must all be taken into account when the formation of baryonic structure is being
considered One solution is to use hydrodynamical simulations to model gas directly
but the lack of fundamental theories for physical processes involved in the formation
and evolution of galaxies such as star formation render them less than optimal As a
result the hydro-simulations also require simple prescriptions for the so-called sub-grid
physics which cannot be modelled directly What can be modelled then
283 Modelling of galaxy formation and evolution
Galaxy formation for a comprehensive view see eg Longair 2008 Mo et al 2010 is
expected to proceed via a two-stage process originally outlined by White  Rees 1978
but see also Hoyle 1953 Binney 1977 Rees  Ostriker 1977 Silk 1977 for early
development In this paradigm the gravitational instability acting on collisionless dark
matter results in the formation of self-gravitating dark matter haloes as already noted
earlier Because baryons initially well mixed with the dark matter are assumed to
feel the dark matter via gravity they also participate in this collapse after the dark
matter haloes have started to form However unlike the dark matter the gas is not
collisionless but can dissipate As a result in a very simplied picture the gas can be
assumed to be heated by shocks to the virial temperature of the dark matter halo during
this infall After which the hot gas can cool radiatively on a time scale set by atomic
physics
During the collapse and cooling the gas is assumed to condense to the cores of col-
lapsed dark matter haloes However it is assumed that this process is not the same in all
haloes In smaller structures such as galaxy host haloes the dominant physical process
is cooling which allows baryons to be more centrally concentrated than dark matter In
contrast in larger structures baryons experience a deeper gravitational potential and can
therefore gain potential energy as they fall to the centre of a halo This process heats
baryonic matter and increases its temperature via shocks eg Birnboim  Dekel 2003
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
As a result baryonic matter experiences pressure forces which do not let them to be as
concentrated as its host dark matter In large-scale structures the process of cooling will
therefore be highly important in the dense cores of dark matter where the gas can cool
Finally the cold gas can fragment into stars and a galaxy is born
To simplify in hierarchical models such as the CDM Section 241 the galaxy
formation involves at minimum the following three stages
I the hierarchical formation of dark matter haloes
II the accretion of gas into the haloes and
III the cooling and fragmentation of the hot gas into stars
Figure 28 shows a logic ow chart for galaxy formation13 The paths leading to the
formation of various galaxies green ellipses are drawn from the initial conditions set
by the cosmological framework discussed in earlier Sections and outlined in Figure 25
Note that the ow chart does not include any feedback effects which have been found
to be signicant and will be discussed later
284 Semi-analytical models of galaxy formation
Due to the complicated physics related to galaxy formation and evolution as seen in
Fig 28 simple rules that can be easily varied to study the importance of different
physical processes are highly useful Semi-analytical models SAMs of galaxy forma-
tion try to ll this void by encoding simplistic rules for the formation and evolution of
galaxies within a cosmological framework A SAM is a collection of physical recipes
that describe an inow of gas how gas can cool and heat up again how stars are formed
within galaxies how stellar populations evolve and how black holes grow using simpli-
ed physics Cole 1991 White  Frenk 1991 Lacey  Silk 1991 Kang et al 2005
Baugh 2006 Lucia  Blaizot 2007 SAMs can also easily include different feedback
effects stellar winds active galactic nuclei AGN or supernovae SNe feedbacks eg
Croton et al 2006 Somerville et al 2008 Ricciardelli  Franceschini 2010 for ex-
ample Hence SAMs try to describe all the gas physics that goes into galaxy formation
and evolution but is not modelled in the dark matter only simulation
Due to their nature SAMs can be used to explore ideas of galaxy formation and
evolution and to understand which physical processes are the most important in the life
of a galaxy by changing the recipes describing the physics SAMs can also be applied
to the so-called sub-grid physics that operates below the resolution of a simulation As
it is not yet possible to simulate all star formation processes McKee  Ostriker 2007
13The ow chart is by no means a complete description of all gas physics that may play a role in galaxy
formation but rather tries to capture the main aspects

simplied processes described in the ow chart The gure is an adaptation of Fig 11 from Mo
et al 2010
Krumholz 2011 in a cosmological context sub-grid physics must be modelled with
simplied physics even when hydrodynamics is involved
The backbone of a SAM is the evolution of dark matter haloes Often this evolution
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
is parameterised with dark matter halo merger trees Fig 29 that allow the hierarchi-
cal nature of gravitational instabilities to be explicitly taken into account Baugh et al
1998 Dark matter merger trees describe how the dark matter haloes form via merg-
ers of smaller haloes They provide the backdrop for the introduction of the baryonic
component which reacts gravitationally to the growing network of dark matter potential
wells Even though modern studies derive merger trees directly from simulations this is
by means not necessary as they can be derived also by using Monte Carlo techniques In
such case the extended Press-Schechter EPS theory Bond et al 1991 Lacey  Cole
1993 is often used The Monte Carlo techniques provide a fast method of generating
merger trees however they have been found to be less than reliable in some cases eg
Cole et al 2008
Figure 29 Example of a merger tree as a function of the lookback time Symbols are colour-
coded as a function of the B  R colour and their area scales with the stellar mass Only
progenitors more massive than 108h1Mcid12 are shown
After a cosmological model has been chosen and the merger trees have been gener-
ated the baryonic processes must be taken into account A SAM typically consists of the
following steps 1 follow the three baryonic components hot and cold gas and stars
and adopt a recipe for disk formation 2 specify a recipe for the conversion rate between
the three components including star formation and feedback effects 3 keep track of
28 GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION
the metallicity of each component 4 convert the star formation history and metallic-
ity of the stellar populations into luminosities and 5 adopt a recipe for galaxy-galaxy
mergers In what follows I briey describe these steps in turn
Heating and cooling of gas
Modern galaxy formation theories assume that the gas density prole follows that of
dark matter When gas falls into the potential well of a dark matter halo it is assumed to
be shock-heated White  Rees 1978 to the virial temperature of the halo given by
mH GMhalo
Here  is the mean molecular mass of the gas mH is the mass of a hydrogen atom k
is the Boltzmanns constant Mhalo is the mass of the halo and rvir is the virial radius
within which the mean density is 200 times the critical density
Before stars can form from the cold T  100 K molecular clouds the shock-heated
hot gas must cool radiatively eg Helly et al 2003 The cooling time can be dened
for example as the ratio of the thermal energy density and the cooling rate per unit
volume In this case the cooling time can be written as
tcoolr 
3mpkTvir
gasrTvir Zgas
where mp is the mean particle mass k refers to the Boltzmann constant gasr is the
hot gas density and Tvir Zgas is the cooling function Note that the cooling rate is
a function of metallicity of the gas Zgas and the virial temperature of the halo Tvir and
thus the cooling is in general more effective in higher density regions Additionally in
highly simplied scenarios the more metal-enriched gas tends to cool faster
Different cooling mechanisms inverse Compton scatter molecular and atomic cool-
ing and bremsstrahlung can however be dominant at different times and tempera-
tures complicating the gas cooling modelling signicantly For example in massive
haloes where Tvir cid38 107 K gas is fully collisionally ionised and cools mainly through
bremsstrahlung emission from free electrons In the temperature range 104 K  Tvir 
106 K excitation and de-excitation mechanisms dominate while in haloes with Tvir 
104 K gas is mainly neutral and the cooling processes are therefore suppressed How-
ever in a simplied scenario the gas is assumed to be able to cool if cooling time is
shorter than some characteristic timescale which is model dependent
As the cold condensed gas accumulates in the central regions of the dark matter
haloes it can be identied as the ISM of the protogalaxy What is assumed to follow
after the cold gas has settled down is a disk formation
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
Disk formation
The disk formation may be modelled after for example the amount of cold gas and
the properties of the host halo The underlying physical notion is that when structures
grow and collapse in the early universe they exert tidal torques on each other This
provides each collapsing dark matter halo with some angular momentum As a result
SAMs typically assume that the cold gas will form a disk with the same specic angular
momentum as the dark matter halo while the size and rotation velocity are determined
by the spin parameter
Here J is the angular momentum of the halo E refers to the total energy of the halo and
M is the mass of the dark matter halo When adopting this simple prescription what
follows is that the mass and spin of the disk is tightly coupled to the mass and spin of
the dark matter halo
The dimensionless angular momentum  is a measure of the degree of rotational
support of the galaxy Note however that the typical values  005 of  of collapsed
dark matter haloes have been found to be signicantly smaller than that of the largely
attened centrifugally supported disk galaxies we observe today with   04  05
Hence a considerable amount of dissipation must have occurred to produce the observed
Star formation
In a typical SAM star formation for a general review see Kennicutt 1998a is assumed
to take place in the disks of galaxies while the actual onset of star formation is assumed
to occur once the surface density of cold gas exceeds a critical density Kennicutt 1998b
1989 in a molecular cloud Krumholz 2011 Ideally the star formation law should be
derived from the rst principles as a function of the physical conditions such as density
temperature metallicity radiation and magnetic elds of the ISM however the detailed
physics involved in the fragmentation of the cold gas collapse and onset of a protostar
and the physical conditions of the ISM are not yet well understood I will however
return to the importance of the ISM in Section 45
Due to the complicated physics involved SAMs often derive the star formation rate
SFR of a galaxy using a simple relation
cid63  SF
cid63
where cold is the density of the cold gas cid63 is the characteristic timescale and SF
is a measure for the efciency of star formation Note however that several different
28 GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION
forms of the above equation have been developed These recipes for the star formation
efciency range from simple models that assume that cid63 is a constant to models that are
proportional to the dynamic time of the galaxy and take into account for example the
circular velocity andor the radius of the disc In any event the above star formation law
is a variant of the empirical Schmidt 1959 law for which it has been assumed that the
SFR is controlled by the self-gravity of the gas
Closely tied to the star formation in galaxies is the number of stars of a given mass
that forms that is the the initial mass function IMF eg Kroupa 2001 Chabrier 2003
SAMs typically assume that the IMF of stellar populations is universal when modelling
star formation Note however that theoretical arguments eg Dav 2008 and indi-
rect observational evidence suggest that the stellar IMF may evolve with eg time van
Dokkum 2008 and references therein or environment casting a shadow over the as-
sumption of universality
Feedback effects
The early SAMs using recipes similar to the above ones were however not able to
reproduce the observed form of the galaxy luminosity function LF Eq 38 They often
over-predicted the number of both faint and bright galaxies especially in the infrared
eg Benson et al 2003 Croton et al 2006 Benson  Devereux 2010 To alleviate the
discrepancy ie to limit the number of faint and bright galaxies a feedback mechanism
was introduced To regulate the star formation in both light and massive dark matter
haloes the feedback was divided to two separate mechanisms that operate on different
mass regimes
Modern SAMs model active galactic nuclei AGN feedback which can suppress
the cooling ow in high mass systems eg Silk  Rees 1998 Croton  Farrar 2008
del P Lagos et al 2008 The AGN feedback Sijacki et al 2007 provides additional
energy that can suppress the cooling of hot gas generating a sharp cut-off to the high-
luminosity end of the LF In many models the strength of the AGN feedback depends
directly on the mass accretion of the black hole MBH thus the modied cooling rate
can be written for example as
M mod
cool  Mcool  
MBHc2
Here  refers to the black hole accretion efciency The additional energy from the
AGN can prevent gas from cooling and is more important in later times when galaxies
have more massive black holes The AGN feedback can therefore help to regulate the
SFR at later epochs and to prevent the overproduction of very massive galaxies Another
effect of AGN feedback is seen on the ages of high stellar mass systems which are
signicantly older for AGN feedback models Khalatyan et al 2008
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
While the AGN feedback affects mainly massive galaxies the supernovae SN feed-
back is important for lighter galaxies and for the metal enrichment of the inter-stellar and
possibly even the inter-galactic medium Vecchia  Schaye 2008 The SN feedback
helps to self-regulate the process of star formation throughout the galaxies history In
the absence of the SN feedback star-formation rates SFRs are extremely high in early
times and fairly low in more recent epochs However with the SN feedback SFRs
are initially lower so more gas is available for later periods of star formation see also
Section 423
The SN feedback can function because in the models it is assumed that a SN can
blow gas out of a star forming disc Moreover it is also assumed that the rate of mass
ejection is proportional to the total mass of stars formed As a result the re-heating of
gas due to the feedback can then be modelled as follows
Mreh  0
SNESN
Mcid63
where ESN is the energy injected by the SN SN is the number of SN per solar mass and
Vc is the circular velocity of the dark matter halo In dwarf galaxies with low circular
velocities the energy from SNe can efciently heat the inter-stellar media ISM which
can then escape the halo through a cool wind Note that hot metals expelled in SNe
explosions are much less bound to the galaxy than the cold ISM and can therefore escape
to the intra-galactic media IGM causing the enrichment of the IGM Hence the energy
from SNe not only suppresses the star formation in light galaxies but is also partially
responsible for the chemical evolution in galaxies see also Section 424
Galaxy mergers
The above denitions for the amount of cool gas disk formation star formation metal
enrichment and feedback effects have assumed a static dark matter halo Dark matter
haloes are not however static but can interact and merge with other haloes eg Kauff-
mann  White 1993 Fakhouri  Ma 2008 as described by their merger trees The
mergers are assumed to be important to the extent that for example Li et al 2007
showed that each dark matter halo virtually independent of its mass experiences about
3  2 major14 mergers since its main progenitor has acquired one per cent of the nal
halo mass Consequently a realistic SAM must also take mergers into account
When dark matter haloes merge galaxies share the same potential well but do not
immediately merge eg Stewart et al 2009 Instead the two galaxies are expected to
orbit in a common halo However with enough time tidal interactions and dynamical
14Note that Li et al 2007 dened a major merger as a merger with a progenitor mass ratio greater than
28 GALAXY FORMATION AND EVOLUTION
friction remove orbital energy and cause the orbit of the subhalo and its galaxy to decay
transporting it towards the centre The orbit decay time has been shown to depend on the
mass ratio of the merging haloes eccentricity of the orbits and the mass loss due to tidal
stripping Colpi et al 1999 Boylan-Kolchin et al 2008 The details of dark matter
halo and galaxy mergers are therefore less than simple For example if the angular
momentum is high and the orbital energy is not low enough the merger cannot happen
in a Hubble time
Despite the complications SAMs often apply simple calculations for the dynamical
friction time If however Nbody merger trees are used instead of the EPS formalism
the spatial information of the simulated haloes can be used
In any event after the
haloes merge SAMs usually assume that the hot halo gas is shock-heated to a new virial
temperature while the cold gas is attached to the centre The hot gas that has not escaped
from the new halo is assumed to form a reservoir in the halo while galaxies residing
inside the halo will merge within a dynamical friction time It is obvious that the physics
of such description of mergers is highly simplied but even so the simplied merger
scenario can lead to galaxies that can statistically match observations reasonably well
see for example Paper IV
Several different types of mergers have been identied major eg Springel  Hern-
quist 2005 and minor eg Bournaud et al 2007 that are related to the mass ratio of
the merging pair and the so-called wet eg Lin et al 2008 and dry mergers eg Bell
et al 2006a Khochfar  Silk 2009 which are related to the gas richness of the merg-
ing pair The remnants of mergers between two galaxies are therefore assumed to depend
primarily on four properties 1 the progenitor mass ratio 2 the gas mass fraction of the
progenitors 3 the orbital properties and to some extent 4 the morphologies of the pro-
genitors It is then usual to assume that the different types of mergers require different
physical prescriptions see the lower part of Fig 28
Unfortunately the relevant mass and gas ratios are often rather arbitrarily dened
in SAMs rendering the current treatment of the different types of galaxy mergers less
physical In case of a minor merger the simplied schemes of mergers often transfer
stars from the lighter galaxy to the bulge of the more massive one generating a spherical
component to the merger remnant Instead in a case of major merger the models may
also take into account the fact that major mergers can induce rapid star formation a
starburst changing the stellar population and the integrated colour of the newly formed
galaxy rapidly The possible starburst is however often tied up to the gas fraction of the
merging pair and to the nal surface density of cold gas Thus the treatment of starbursts
is often model dependent Mergers may also induce AGN activity which has been taken
into account in some models eg Somerville et al 2008 while some have implemented
a variable IMF eg Lacey et al 2010 Independent of the adopted model it is however
clear that due to the mergers of dark matter haloes and galaxies a detailed analysis of
CHAPTER 2 FORMATION OF STRUCTURE
the formation history and the possible environmental effects must be taken into account
when studying galaxy formation and evolution I will return to this in Chapter 4 when
discussing the evolution of galaxies
CHAPTER 3
Groups of Galaxies
Someone told me that each equation I included in the book would halve the sales   
Stephen Hawking
31 The overall picture
Chapter 2 briey described the formation of structure and how observable structures
such as galaxies form
It was also mentioned that large galaxy surveys have shown
that galaxies Fig 41 can be considered to be the basic building blocks of the visible
Universe However as Figure 23 implies galaxies are found to be located in larger
structures such as groups Fig 31 and clusters more often than in isolation To be more
precise more than half of all galaxies are found to be part of larger structures This has
been found to be true to the extent that most galaxies with luminosities less than the
characteristic luminosity Lcid63 for a denition see Eq 38 have been found to be located
in an environment comparable to the Local Group Thus to understand galaxy formation
and evolution - and to understand the Universe - one must understand groups and clusters
of galaxies as the evolution of most galaxies takes place in these systems Additionally
groups of galaxies are important cosmological indicators of the distribution of matter
in the Universe making them important also for cosmology But what denes a galaxy
A galaxy group is a concentration of galaxies assumed to be embedded in an ex-
tended dark matter halo1 Ideally the galaxies forming a group are physically bound
together due to their mutual gravitational attraction and the presence of the dark matter
halo However from the observational point of view group members are not easy to
dene because dark matter haloes cannot be observed directly Thus not all observed
groupings of galaxies are real physical and gravitationally bound systems as they can be
a result of chance superpositions of galaxies at different distances see eg Fig 31 or
galaxies within laments that are viewed edge-on Such systems are gravitationally un-
bound sometimes phrased as spurious or pseudo-groups rather than real gravitationally
bound groups of galaxies eg Hernquist et al 1995 Ramella et al 1997
1This denition applies also to galaxy clusters
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
Groups of galaxies typically contain fewer than  50 members and are often dom-
inated by spiral galaxies When larger groups are considered the main constituent of
galaxies usually shifts from spirals to lenticulars but no clear cut-off in number of mem-
bers exists between groups and clusters The number of member galaxies is in general
a problematic property see eg Paz et al 2006 especially in magnitude limited obser-
vations where deeper observations can reveal new members who were previously too
faint to be detected This is true even for the Local Group LG Thus better quantities
to discriminate between groups and clusters are mass and size though these do not pro-
vide clear cut-off values either Typical groups are  1  2 Mpc in a diameter and their
total mass MDM  10125140h1Mcid12 Huchra  Geller 1982 while typical clusters
are about an order of magnitude more massive and a few times larger eg Einasto et al
2003a 2005 Koester et al 2007 Typical groups are therefore smaller and less massive
than clusters of galaxies but larger and more massive than binary galaxy systems
Most of the stellar mass in the present Universe is in groups similar to the LG with
masses a few times 1012Mcid12 and only  2 per cent is in clusters with total mass  5 
1014Mcid12 Eke et al 2006 Groups have been found to be present already at redshifts z 
1 eg Francis et al 1996 Moller  Warren 1998 Andreon et al 2009 Bielby et al
2010 and their environment density is intermediate between that of isolated galaxies
and that of the cores of rich clusters The study of groups may therefore provide clues to
the processes that create the observed dependency of galaxy morphology on environment
Postman  Geller 1984 Allington-Smith et al 1993 Whitmore et al 1993 Zabludoff
et al 1996 Hashimoto et al 1998 I return to this question in the next Chapter
The birth of the study of galaxy groups and clusters can be dated back to 1933
and to Fritz Zwicky who was the rst to apply the virial theorem to the Coma cluster
Zwicky 1933 In his early work Zwicky derived a dynamical mass for the cluster that
seemed to be signicantly larger than if all of the mass came from visible galaxies This
was interpreted as a rst sign of the yet-to-be-seen invisible matter holding the cluster
together Note that the early interpretation of Zwickys dynamical mass statement holds
only when the object is at least gravitationally bound if not in virial equilibrium but this
was taken for granted at the time
Since 1933 several authors have studied groups of galaxies and concluded that the
majority of galaxies in the Universe lie in groups Holmberg 1950 Humason et al
1956 Turner  Gott 1976 Huchra  Geller 1982 Geller  Huchra 1983 Nolthenius
 White 1987 Ramella et al 1989 Karachentsev 2005 Large astronomical redshift
surveys such as the 2dFGRS 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey and SDSS Sloan Digital
Sky Survey have also produced large group catalogues Eke et al 2004ab Balogh
et al 2004a Merchn  Zandivarez 2005 Tago et al 2006 Eke et al 2006 Berlind
et al 2006 Yang et al 2007 Knobel et al 2009 with up to ten thousand groups eg
Eke et al 2004a Even so the physical processes operating in groups of galaxies are
32 GROUP IDENTIFICATION
still poorly understood albeit groups are known to be important for several reasons For
example as Chapter 2 described dark matter haloes and even galaxies merge together
Section 284 This is obviously more probable in denser environments where relative
velocities are lower and dynamical friction is higher as in groups Moreover mergers are
only effective in systems with a velocity dispersion smaller than or comparable to the
internal velocities of galaxies for detailed discussion see eg Mo et al 2010 Hence
galaxy mergers are assumed to take place effectively in groups of galaxies
Before groups can be used to study the evolution of galaxies or even before any
group properties can robustly be measured groups of galaxies must be correctly iden-
tied and discriminated from other forms of structures like binary galaxy pairs large
clusters of galaxies and most importantly from chance alignments Interestingly this
has been found to be not as simple as one might navely rst assume Papers I and II and
references therein
32 Group identication
There are generally three basic pieces of information available in observations for the
study of galaxy distribution position luminosity and the redshift of each galaxy Al-
though the apparent luminosity is important as a measure of the objects visibility it is
usually a poor criterion for group membership Moreover the apparent luminosity can
also be misleading when applied in group studies as will be shown in Section 36 Ob-
servations are therefore usually left with only information describing the position of the
galaxies in redshift-space see however the caveats mention in Section 222
In recent years a number of different grouping algorithms have been developed and
applied eg Turner  Gott 1976 Materne 1978 Huchra  Geller 1982 Botzler et al
2004 Goto et al 2002 Kim et al 2002 Bahcall et al 2003 Gerke et al 2005 Koester
et al 2007 Yang et al 2007 to identify groups using the redshift-space information
Despite the vast number of grouping algorithms the Friends-of-Friends2 FoF Huchra
 Geller 1982 percolation algorithm remains the most frequently applied one The FoF
algorithm or slightly modied versions of it see eg Knobel et al 2009 are the most
widely used grouping algorithms even for modern day galaxy surveys like SDSS and
COSMOS Hence it is important to understand its functionality and limitations
321 The Friends-of-Friends algorithm
The Friends-of-Friends FoF group nding algorithm Huchra  Geller 1982 takes
advantage of two often available quantities in observational galaxy catalogues the pro-

two algorithms are not identical
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
jected separation in the sky and the velocity difference in the redshift space The group-
ing method itself begins with the selection of a galaxy which has not been previously
assigned to any of the existing groups After choosing a galaxy the next step is to search
for companions with the projected separation D12 smaller or equal to the separation DL
cid18 
cid19 V
D12  2 sin
 DLV1 V2 m1 m2
where the mean cosmological expansion velocity
V1  V2
and the velocity difference V12 is smaller or equal to the velocity VL
V12  V1  V2  VLV1 V2 m1 m2
Here V1 and V2 refer to the velocities redshifts of the galaxy and its companion m1
and m2 are their magnitudes and  is their angular separation in the sky If no compan-
ions are found the galaxy is entered on a list of isolated galaxies while all companions
found are added to the list of group members The surroundings of each companion
are then searched by using the same method This process is repeated until no further
members are found and all potential group members have been searched
There is a variety of prescriptions for DL and VL in the literature for references
see Paper I However the original method assumes that the luminosity function LF is
independent of distance and position and that at larger distances only the fainter galaxies
are missing For each pair we therefore take

where the integration limits can be calculated from equations

In Eq 34 M  is the differential galaxy luminosity function for the sample and D0
is the projected separation in Mpc chosen at some ducial distance DF  The limiting

limits are given by Eqs 35 and 36
For simplicity it is often convenient to assume that the differential galaxy luminosity
function can be described in form of a Schechter 1976 LF
M  
cid63 ln 10
5 M cid63M cid171
cid16
5 M cid63M 
where M is the absolute magnitude of the object and  M cid63 and cid63 parametrize the
In the Schechter formalism the M cid63 and Lcid63 refer to
Schechter luminosity function
the characteristic absolute magnitude and luminosity respectively and mark a point in
which the luminosity function exhibits a sudden change in the slope For example the

of the Galaxy Driver et al 2007 but the exact value depends on the environment and
on the dark matter halo mass Cooray  Milosavljevic 2005 Note also that the galaxy
LF has been found to evolve signicantly as a function of redshift especially at early
cosmic epochs see eg Bouwens et al 2011 Nevertheless the luminosity function
is a powerful tool and provides information on the relative frequency of galaxies with a
given luminosity
The theory of gravitational instability see Section 25 predicts that the number of
virialized systems that have formed at any given time depends on their mass with more
massive systems being less abundant than less massive ones Therefore by coupling to-
gether the information on the luminosity and the number of galaxies the LF can provide
information on the formation and evolution of both the structural and visible components
of galaxies However for identifying galaxy groups the exact shape of the luminosity
function is less important than the adopted values of D0 and V0 as was noticed during
the study of Paper I Hence I will not concentrate more on the LF in the context of
groups I will however return to it in Chapter 4
33 Different species of groups a brief overview
Grouping algorithms such as the FoF algorithm produce catalogues of galaxy systems
with a vast amount of different properties This has resulted in a classication of systems
with similar properties For example systems of galaxies can be classied as loose eg
Ramella et al 1995 1997 Tucker et al 2000 Einasto et al 2003b poor eg Zablud-
off  Mulchaey 1998 Mahdavi et al 1999 compact eg Shakhbazyan 1973 Hick-
son 1982 Hickson et al 1989 Diaferio et al 1994 Barton et al 1996 Tovmassian
et al 2006 or fossil groups eg Ponman et al 1994 Jones et al 2003 Santos et al
2007 von Benda-Beckmann et al 2008 depending on common properties However
the vast number of different classes can also be interpreted as a sign that the relationship
among systems of galaxies is not yet well understood
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
The key idea behind the above classication rises from the diversity of evolutionary
stages within which a galaxy group can be found For example compact groups are
assumed to be observed briey before they are about to merge while fossil groups which
are often dominated by a large central elliptical galaxy are possibly the end product of
such a merging Therefore a general unication of different classes might be possible
in the future when the evolution of galaxy groups is better understood However due to
the historical reasons I briey summarise each class and how they have been dened in
the following Sections When appropriate I will also describe some selected properties
of each class their evolutionary stage and the possible signicance for galaxy evolution
in general
331 Loose groups
Loose groups of galaxies with a space density of  105 Mpc3 Nolthenius  White
1987 represent the most common class of groups and are often simply referred to as
groups They comprise  50 members including large number of faint dwarf galaxies
and the whole group typically extends to a diameter of up to  15 Mpc Thus loose
groups are as the name implies an intermediate in scale between compact groups Sec-
tion 333 and rich clusters Consequently it has been argued that their dynamics is
important for the study of the distribution of dark matter Oemler 1988
Tucker et al 2000 nds a median line-of-sight velocity dispersion of 164 km s1
and median virial mass  19  1013h1Mcid12 for loose groups However Einasto et al
2003b argue that loose groups in the neighbourhood of a rich cluster are typically
25 times more massive and 16 times more luminous than loose groups on average
Furthermore Einasto et al 2003b nd that these groups have velocity dispersions of
about 13 times larger than the loose groups on average The immediate neighbourhood
of a loose group can therefore have a signicant impact on the group properties and
dynamics Hence a nearby large cluster can enhance the evolution of the neighbouring
loose group making it difcult to draw common values for the properties of loose groups
that would apply to all of them
Due to their relatively small velocity dispersions and intermediate sizes loose groups
can be important when galaxies that may merge in the future are being identied and
studied For example Mamon 1986 was the rst to suggest that compact groups might
be transient unbound cores of loose groups Indeed further studies have conrmed that
loose groups are associated with compact groups and that loose groups are often the
birth places of compact groups Vennik et al 1993 Ramella et al 1994 Diaferio et al
1994 Thus loose groups can host some sort of an association with a compact group
providing a link between their evolutionary stages
33 DIFFERENT SPECIES OF GROUPS A BRIEF OVERVIEW
332 Poor groups
Most galaxies in the local Universe including the Galaxy belong to a poor group
of galaxies Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 The historical denition of a poor group
dictates that poor groups typically contain fewer than ve bright L  Lcid63 galaxies
Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 and that the total number of group members is less than
in a typical loose group Deeper redshift surveys have however identied new and faint
galaxies around poor groups bringing them closer to the denition of loose groups For
example surveys such as the SDSS have helped to identify new faint dwarf galaxies that
belong to the Local Group LG eg Willman et al 2005 Irwin et al 2007 Walsh
et al 2007 Belokurov et al 2008 Belokurov et al 2010 raising the total number of
LG members to  40 Obviously the number of brighter Lcid63-galaxies in the LG has not
changed and satisfy the criterion of less than ve but as the total number of members is
reaching 50 it is questionable whether one can talk about a poor group any longer
As mentioned earlier the total number of companions may however not be all that
important for groups
Instead the fraction of early-type galaxies in the poor groups
has been found to vary signicantly ranging from that characteristic of the eld 
25 per cent to that of rich clusters  55 per cent Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 in
disagreement with many loose groups The relatively high early-type fraction in poor
groups is indeed surprising because most poor groups have low galaxy number density
thus the effects of disruptive mechanisms such as galaxy harassment Moore et al
1996 are assumed to be weaker than in rich or compact groups In contrast however
the kinematics of poor groups makes them preferred sites for galaxy-galaxy mergers
which may alter the morphologies and star formation histories of some group members
Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 providing a possible explanation for the relatively large
number of elliptical galaxies
The dynamical status of poor groups has also been questioned in several studies eg
Zabludoff  Mulchaey 1998 Mahdavi et al 1999 and references therein The higher
galaxy densities than in the eld and lower velocity dispersions than in cluster cores
make them favourable sites for galaxy-galaxy mergers Barnes 1985 Consequently
one would assume that if poor groups are old structures several mergers should have
taken place Thus if some or even all poor groups are gravitationally bound why do we
observe them at all One possible explanation is that bound poor groups are collapsing
for the rst time and in such they will eventually face the same destiny as loose groups
that is being eventually associated with compact groups
333 Compact groups
A compact group CG of galaxies can be loosely dened as a group of galaxies with
a small number of members in which the typical intergalactic separation is of the order
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
of the scale of the galaxies Historically CGs have been studied by several authors
eg Shakhbazyan 1973 Rose 1977 however probably the most well-studied CG
catalogue is the Hickson Compact Groups HCGs see eg Hickson 1982 Hickson
et al 1988 1989
HCGs are compact congurations of relatively isolated systems of typically four or
ve galaxies in close proximity to one another see Fig 31 and Hickson et al 1989
and references therein They have also been found to show peculiarities in terms of
morphology or kinematics starbursts or even AGN activity for a complete review see
Hickson 1997 Furthermore HCGs have been found to contain large quantities of
diffuse gas and to be dynamically dominated by dark matter for predictions of X-ray
properties see Diaferio et al 1995 They have also been found to trace the large-
scale structure but to prefer low-density environments As already mentioned in Section
331 HCGs may form as subsystems within looser galaxy associations and evolve by
gravitational processes Thus while compact groups are associated with loose groups
and laments these tend to be low-density and sparsely populated systems Even so
Walker et al 2010 speculate that due to their mid-infrared colours the compact group
environment fosters accelerated evolution of galaxies
The fraction of late-type galaxies has been found to be signicantly lower in compact
groups than in the eld However a given CG is also more likely to contain galaxies of a
similar type than would be expected for a random distribution Hickson 1997 and refer-
ences therein Zepf  Whitmore 1993 found that elliptical galaxies in compact groups
tend to have lower internal velocity dispersions than do ellipticals of similar properties
in other environments Moreover elliptical galaxies of CGs have been found to lie off
the fundamental plane dened by ellipticals in other environments This suggests that
the velocity dispersion is of greater physical relevance to the formation and evolution of
galaxies in CGs than is the apparent physical density
The strong galaxy interactions in CGs see Fig 31 are expected to induce mergers
of group members for early simulations see Mamon 1987 The dynamical timescales
of CGs have however been argued and range from relatively short  01H1
0  eg
Diaferio et al 1994 to longer ones  H1
eg Governato et al 1996 Athanassoula
et al 1997 If however the merger timescales are somewhere between the two extremes
it is likely that CGs are rather short lived To explain this it has been suggested that CGs
may be continuously replenished through dynamical evolution of loose groups Diaferio
et al 1994 Ramella et al 1994 This provides a reasoning for the existence of CGs but
what will they become in the course of evolution One potential scenario was described
by Borne et al 2000 who suggest that the evolutionary progression from CGs can
lead rst to pairs followed by ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs and nally to
elliptical galaxies Thus it is possible that CGs are the progenitors for ULIRGs see also
Section 45 Note however that it has also been suggested that the eventual demise of

the CG due to mergers could lead to the formation of a fossil group eg Vikhlinin et al
1999 Mulchaey  Zabludoff 1999
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
334 Fossil groups
The denition of a fossil group is often based on the following criteria of Jones et al
2003 A fossil system is dened as a spatially extended X-ray source with an X-
ray luminosity from diffuse hot gas of LXbol  1042h2
50 erg s1 while the optical
counterpart is a system of galaxies with m12  20 where m12 is the magnitude
gap between the brightest and the second brightest galaxy in the R-band within half the
projected virial radius of the group centre The reasoning for the optical criterium is that
it is supposed to guarantee that the system is dominated by an E or cD type galaxy and
that other members of the system can only cause small perturbations to the total potential
well of the system Consequently rendering fossil groups as systems of galaxies that are
dominated mainly by a single massive galaxy
The rst fossil group was discovered by Ponman et al 1994 using Rntgensatellit
ROSAT X-ray data Since the discovery of fossil groups Khosroshahi et al 2007
compiled a list of seven fossil groups based on Chandra X-ray Observatory data and
Santos et al 2007 used SDSS data to identify 34 candidates Fossil groups have also
been studied theoretically using cosmological N-body simulations eg DOnghia et al
2005 DOnghia et al 2007 Sales et al 2007 Daz-Gimnez et al 2008 Interestingly
based on the results of different studies fossil groups have been interpreted in different
Jones et al 2003 describe fossil groups as old undisturbed systems which have
avoided infall into galaxy clusters but where galaxy merging of most of the Lcid63 galaxies
has occurred Khosroshahi et al 2007 suggest that fossil groups have formed early
while Vikhlinin et al 1999 and Mulchaey  Zabludoff 1999 suggest that fossils can
be the result of galaxy merging within a compact group In contrast it has also been sug-
gested that fossil groups are the remnants of what was initially a poor group of galaxies
that has been transformed to this old stage of galaxy evolution in low density environ-
ments with compact groups acting as likely way station in this evolution Eigenthaler
 Zeilinger 2009 In cosmological N-body simulations fossil groups represent undis-
turbed early forming systems in which large and massive galaxies have merged to form
a single dominant elliptical galaxy Dariush et al 2007 von Benda-Beckmann et al
2008 Given the different interpretations it is clear that more work is required before
fossil groups can be considered as fully understood
34 Dynamical properties of groups
The earlier discussion about the properties of different group classes implied that the dy-
namical state and properties can be helpful when studying the effects of the environment
involved in galaxy evolution The rst basic property of a galaxy group to consider is
therefore the velocity dispersion v The velocity dispersions of groups usually range
34 DYNAMICAL PROPERTIES OF GROUPS
up to a few hundred km s1 while clusters of galaxies can show dispersions up to about
a thousand km s1 Due to the difculties in measuring the true three dimensional mo-
tions of galaxies the velocity dispersion is however often measured in radial direction
Moreover the velocity dispersion of a group is only a meaningful quantity if the group is
a gravitationally bound system otherwise some of the group members are participating
in the pure Hubble ow and their radial velocities are biased eg Baryshev et al 2001
Macci et al 2005 Teerikorpi et al 2008 Chernin et al 2009 The assumption of
boundness is however not straightforward and there is no guarantee that eg the FoF
algorithm has identied only groups that are bound structures This assumption and its
implications will be discussed in more detail as described in the next Section Despite
the potential complications studies Paper I and references therein have shown that
observed velocity dispersions are in general in agreement with those of cosmological
N-body simulations when a CDM cosmology is adopted
The velocity dispersion of a group is obviously connected to its internal dynamics
and to the depth of the potential well of the host dark matter halo Thus for a gravita-
tionally bound system the velocity dispersion can be used to derive the total dynamical
mass of the group For example one simple yet often applied method links the groups
velocity dispersion and size to its mass in a following way
Mobs  2
Here RH is the mean harmonic radius ie the size of the group When this simple
relation is applied to an observed group the assumption of boundness is often taken for
granted or argued based on the small value of the virial crossing time
532v
which is written in units of the Hubble time H1
The virial crossing time is usually assumed to describe the groups dynamical sta-
tus If a crossing time is short compared to the Hubble time the group must be bound
otherwise it would have dispersed long ago However as one may choose various def-
initions for the velocity dispersion and for the group size which in combination dene
the crossing time these choices introduce signicant and systematic biases in the nal
value of the crossing time Moreover the inclusion of non-members and the existence
of galaxy pairs both of which increase the mean projected velocity can systematically
bias the velocity dispersion The crossing time is therefore not a robust indicator for
dening a groups dynamical status and to discriminate between gravitationally bound
and unbound groups eg Diaferio et al 1994 Paper I
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
35 Are observed groups gravitationally bound
351 Background
Due to the uncertainties for example in the virial crossing times it is unclear which
observed groupings of galaxies if any are gravitationally bound structures However as
Chapter 2 described galaxies reside in large dark matter haloes Thus if group members
are required to belong to the same dark matter halo most groups of such type can readily
be taken as gravitationally bound structures However as observations cannot directly
observe dark matter haloes and therefore identify galaxies that belong to the same halo
the problem of identifying real group members remains Moreover it is possible that
some substructure of a given halo has higher velocity than the required escape velocity
complicating the matter even further
Fortunately cosmological N-body simulations provide a tool to study whether group-
ing algorithms such as the FoF can identify groups of galaxies that are gravitationally
bound systems In simulations it is simple to mimic observations by placing the observer
inside the simulation volume either to an arbitrary location or a specially selected envi-
ronment that mimics the observed surroundings of the Local Group After choosing the
origin it is then relatively straightforward to use simulation data to generate mock group
catalogues that mimic observations for a detailed description see Papers I and II Fi-
nally such catalogues can be used to make theoretical predictions about the properties
of groups
352 Virial theorem
As cosmological N-body simulations provide detailed dynamical information of each
dark matter halo and even each particle that forms the halo the virial theorem can be
used to measure the dynamical status of a galaxy group by relating its kinetic energy to
that of the potential In general the total kinetic energy of a galaxy group may be written
cid88
MiMj xi  xj2
while the total potential energy is
cid88
Here Mi and Mj are the masses of the two galaxies xi and xj are their velocities and
Rij is the distance between them while M corresponds to the total mass of the system
It is now trivial to nd the dynamical status of the system if the group fulls the simple
35 ARE OBSERVED GROUPS GRAVITATIONALLY BOUND
criterion
T  U  0
it can be considered gravitationally bound Note however that this criteria is looser
than the requirement of equilibrium or virialisation which are also used in literature
and which require that
353 The fraction of gravitationally bound groups
Based on the results of simulations of different cosmologies Paper I it is clear that a sig-
nicant fraction of groupings returned by the FoF are gravitationally unbound according
to Eq 313 Importantly this result is mostly independent of the value of the cosmo-
logical constant or the apparent magnitude limit of the mimicked observations as Papers
I and II show In Paper II stricter parameter values for D0 and V0 Section 321 were
adopted however this did not change the fact that almost half of the groupings returned
by the FoF algorithm were found to be unbound In Paper I two different parameter sets
for the luminosity function were used but that did not have any signicant effect either
the large number of gravitationally unbound systems remained
The large fraction of unbound groupings returned by the FoF algorithm should not
be disregarded lightly without further consideration The fact that a signicant fraction
of identied groups are in reality gravitationally unbound implies that the majority of
current group catalogues have overestimated group masses when eg the virial theo-
rem has been erroneously applied to unbound systems Furthermore Paper I nds that
the virial crossing time in a form of Eq 310 is not a good measure to discriminate un-
bound pseudo-groups from real bound systems Paper I see also Diaferio et al 1994
shows that there is no correlation between Eq 310 and the virial ratio which is the ratio
between the groups potential Eq 312 and kinetic energy Eq 311 This calls into
question the crossing time as an estimator of gravitationally bound systems albeit it has
been widely accepted amongst majority of observational astronomers
Identifying bound structures
If the virial crossing time does not provide a good and unbiased estimate for the dynam-
ical status of a group can we nd another quantity that can be used instead Unfor-
tunately there is no simple relation that would readily tell if a group is gravitationally
bound or even virialized The problem lies in the difculty of observing dark matter
haloes and estimating their masses in observations Currently there is no any easy and
accurate way to measure the depth of the potential well of a group complicating the mat-
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
ter even further Hence the question remains is there a method to estimate if a group of
galaxies is gravitationally bound
The prime focus of Paper I was to answer this question Its Figures 12 and 13 show
how the probability of a galaxy group being unbound depends on two observable param-
eters the velocity dispersion and the pairwise separation However the complication
here lies in the fact that both of these quantities had to be normalised with the total mass
of the group before clear trends could be seen Thus one must obtain a reasonable
estimate for the total mass of the group before the method described in Paper I can be
applied At the moment the most robust mass estimates are likely provided by X-ray
observations of the hot intergalactic medium that is assumed to describe the depth of
the potential well If information describing the groups mass is available the method
developed in Paper I can be used to provide information about a groups dynamical sta-
tus that should prove to be more robust than currently favoured practise of applying the
virial crossing time
36 Discordant redshifts
361 Background
An excess of higher redshift galaxies with respect to the group centre was discovered
by Arp 1970 1982 and it was studied in detail by Jaakkola 1971 Since then many
authors have found a statistically signicant excess of high redshift companions relative
to the group centre Bottinelli  Gouguenheim 1973 extended the study of Arp 1970
to nearby groups of galaxies and Sulentic 1984 found a statistically signicant excess
of positive redshifts while studying spiral-dominated ie the central galaxy is a spiral
galaxy groups in contrast to the ES0-dominated ie the central galaxy is an elliptical
or lenticular galaxy groups that showed a minor blueshift excess Also Girardi et al
1992 found discordant redshifts while studying nearby small groups identied by Tully
1988 in the Nearby Galaxy Catalogue However the conventional theory holds that the
distribution of redshift differentials for galaxies moving under the gravitational potential
of a group should be evenly distributed Even systematic radial motions within a group
would be expected to produce redshift differentials that are evenly distributed To solve
this discrepancy between observations and the conventional theory even new physics
was suggested see eg Arp 1970
Since the rst observations of discordant redshifts in the 1970s multiple theories
have been suggested to explain the observed redshift excess Sulentic 1984 listed some
possible origins for the observed redshift excess while Byrd  Valtonen 1985 and
Valtonen  Byrd 1986 argued that this positive excess is mainly due to the unbound
expanding members and the fact that the dominant members of these groups are some-
times misidentied Opposite to this Girardi et al 1992 argued that the positive ex-
36 DISCORDANT REDSHIFTS
cess may be explained if groups are still collapsing and contain dust in the intragroup
medium Hickson et al 1988 ran Monte Carlo simulations and concluded that the ef-
fects caused by the random projection can explain discordant redshifts and Iovino 
Hickson 1997 similarly found that projection effects alone can account for the high
incidence of discordant redshifts However studies by Hickson et al 1988 and Iovino
 Hickson 1997 dealt only with Hickson Compact Groups that have only a few mem-
bers in close proximity as noted in Section 333 Zaritsky 1992 studied asymmetric
distribution of satellite galaxy velocities with Monte Carlo simulations and concluded
that observational biases partially explain the observed redshift asymmetry but cannot
account for the whole magnitude of it Despite and partially because of the vast number
of explanations none of the explanations were found to be truly satisfactory and some
even contradict one another As a result the problem of discordant redshifts remained
362 The origin of redshift asymmetries
Byrd  Valtonen 1985 and Valtonen  Byrd 1986 were the rst ones to propose
that redshift asymmetries should arise in nearby groups of galaxies if a large fraction of
the group population is unbound to the group They argued that the redshift asymmetry
explains the need for missing matter the dark matter that was at the time supposed
to exist at the level of the closing density of the Universe in groups of galaxies These
authors argued that if the group as a whole is not virialized there is no need for ex-
cessive amounts of binding matter and it might also lead to the observed asymmetries
Despite their efforts a conrmation was never obtained Fortunately cosmological N-
body simulations Section 27 provide an invaluable tool to study projection effects as
the origin of the observer can be chosen freely Simulations also provide information
about the dark matter halo dynamics and substructure while the group dynamics could
be studied with the tools developed and introduced in Paper I and briey summarised in
the previous Section Thus cosmological simulations provided an excellent tool to test
the explanation of Byrd  Valtonen 1985 and Valtonen  Byrd 1986 This was the
main topic of Paper II
Paper II nds that gravitationally bound groups of simulated galaxies do not show
any statistically signicant redshift excess This result is in agreement with the conven-
tional theory where it is expected that the distribution of redshift differentials are evenly
distributed A simulated group catalogue that includes only gravitationally bound groups
of galaxies show an equal number of galaxies relative to the brightest member within
statistical uctuations It is therefore important for galaxy group studies to be able to
accurately identify gravitationally bound structures and exclude change alignments and
spurious groups from the group catalogue as noted already in Section 35 and in Paper
CHAPTER 3 GROUPS OF GALAXIES
A detailed study of simulated groups shows that when the dominant members of
groups are identied by using their absolute B-band magnitudes a small blueshift ex-
cess arises This is mainly due to the magnitude limited observations that can miss the
faint background galaxies in groups Moreover B-band is also problematic because of
another reason it tends to make star-forming spirals which have a larger number of hot
O and B-type stars and which do not have much dust brighter than regular red elliptical
galaxies Thus the brightest galaxy in B-band may not accurately mark the centre of the
potential well of a group and can create an articial imbalance between the front and the
back part of the group This together with the current inability to accurately measure
the relative distances inside groups of galaxies except for a few of the nearest ones eg
Karachentsev et al 1997 Jerjen et al 2001 Rekola et al 2005 Rekola et al 2005
Teerikorpi et al 2008 complicates the identication of the group centre if no X-ray
detection of possible hot IGM is available
The misidentication of the group centre can lead to a redshift excess since it is
more likely that the apparently brightest galaxy is in the front part of the group than in
the back part of it Paper II shows that when the group centre is not correctly identied
it can cause the majority of the observed redshift excess If simultaneously the group is
also gravitationally unbound the level of the redshift excess becomes as high as in ob-
servations The explanation of Byrd  Valtonen 1985 and Valtonen  Byrd 1986 for
the origin of the redshift excess was therefore veried in Paper II This further rendered
the need to introduce any anomalous redshift mechanism futile in order to explain the
redshift excess rst noted by Arp 1970 The result also underlines the importance of
robust group centre and member identication Interestingly though this fact together
with the method of Paper I can also be used as an advantage that is to estimate if a
given group is likely to be gravitationally bound system
37 Summaries of Papers I and II
371 Summary of Paper I
The ability to identify gravitationally bound groups of galaxies from observational data
is of great importance as discussed in this Chapter Paper I shows that a large fraction
of groupings are gravitationally unbound when the most often used grouping algorithm
Friends-of-Friends is applied to simulated data This result was found to be mostly in-
dependent of the cosmology and values of the free parameters adopted as all tested cases
led to large fractions of gravitationally unbound systems We can therefore conclude that
the results of Paper I imply that all group catalogues based on the FoF are likely to hold
a signicant fraction of spurious groups
To mitigate the difculty of identifying gravitationally bound groups a method was
developed in Paper I that can be used to estimate the probability that an observed group
37 SUMMARIES OF PAPERS I AND II
is a gravitationally bound system This method however requires an estimate for the total
group mass which may not be straightforward to obtain from the available observational
data Even so this method has been successfully applied for example in Mendel et al
2008
372 Summary of Paper II
Paper II extended the study and the results of Paper I It explains a long-standing phe-
nomenon of discordant redshifts that was found from observational galaxy group cata-
logues The explanation of redshift asymmetries was found to be two fold 1 gravita-
tionally unbound groups and 2 the misidentication of the group centre Together these
two difculties can comprise a redshift asymmetry that is as large as found from obser-
vational group catalogues Thus observational bias together with the CDM cosmology
can naturally provide a satisfactory explanation for the discordant redshifts without the
need for a new physics or more complicated explanations which had earlier been sug-
gested in literature

Galaxy Evolution

all afternoon because I have no choice
Andre Agassi
41 Preamble
Chapter 2 briey described the theory of structure formation while Section 28 con-
centrated on the theory of galaxy formation and evolution
It was noted that galaxy
formation and evolution are the results of a complex sequence of events that occurred
during the structure formation However how does the theory relate to observations and
what can the properties of galaxies tell us about their evolution Thanks to the nite
speed of light galaxies at earlier cosmic epochs can be studied simply by observing
distant galaxies Hence observations can help to set constraints for evolution of galax-
ies In this Chapter I therefore briey summarise the observational constraints on galaxy
evolution and present two theoretical case studies of the evolution of galaxies
The galaxies we observe in the Universe at the current epoch Fig 41 exhibit an
enormous variety of properties such as morphologies colours luminosities masses and
dynamics eg Blanton  Moustakas 2009 and references therein For example most
regular elliptical galaxies have very low atomic gas content albeit they often have sig-
nicant hot ionised gas Mathews  Brighenti 2003 Instead spiral galaxies frequently
show star formation which is fuelled by cool molecular hydrogen Thus the galaxy pop-
ulation is vast in their properties but why do galaxies show such a variety Is a given
property an indication of an evolutionary phase in the life of a galaxy or have galaxies
with different properties formed and evolved in completely different ways
A goal of galaxy evolution studies is to reconstruct back in time the physical mecha-
nisms that led to the present-day galaxies and to explain them One of the main questions
in the study of galaxy evolution is whether initial conditions of the formation place and
therefore time will govern the galaxy evolution or if the surrounding environment will
shape galaxies when they mature This question is often dubbed shortly as nature ver-
sus nurture dichotomy and has been a long standing puzzle in modern astrophysics I
will return to this important question in Section 43 but before delving into it I shall
briey describe the basic properties of galaxies and how they have evolved as a function
of cosmic time

or irregular galaxies with active star formation eg Strateva et al 2001 Balogh et al
2004b Baldry et al 2004 Bell et al 2004 Kauffmann et al 2004 Croton et al
2005 In general bluer galaxies are dominated by emission from young hot stars while
red galaxies contain old stars andor more attenuating dust Note however that the in-
tegrated colour of a galaxy does not necessarily correlate directly with age or the rate in
which a given galaxy is forming stars but can also be due to other effects such as dust
or chemical evolution I will return to this important matter in the following Sections
The two sequences of galaxies can also be identied in the luminosity function LF
for a denition see Eq 38 the faint end of the luminosity function is dominated by
the blue cloud galaxies while the bright end is dominated by the red passively evolving
galaxies eg Bell et al 2004 It has also been noted that while red galaxies constitute
roughly one-fth of the population they produce about two-fths of the total cosmic
galaxy luminosity density Hogg et al 2002 More importantly observations imply
that the total stellar mass density of galaxies on the red sequence has roughly doubled
over the last 6  8 Gyr while that of blue galaxies has remained almost constant eg
Bell et al 2004 Faber et al 2007 If we assume that new stars form mostly in blue
galaxies this suggests that galaxies are being transformed from the blue cloud to the red
sequence This transformation is assumed to take  2 Gyr after the star formation of
the blue cloud galaxy has been truncated Mo et al 2010 Thus signicant evolution
between the two sequences is assumed to take place as a function of cosmic time As
a result it should be kept in mind that even though the galaxy distribution of many
properties is bimodal all galaxies irrespectively of morphology or colour show great
variations in the amounts and spatial distribution of gas dust stars and metals as well
as their luminosities surface brightnesses and masses This is illustrated in Fig 41
where a small sample of local galaxies is being presented
422 The morphology-density relation
The galaxy population is frequently phrased today in terms of the morphology-density
or colour-density relation while the morphological diversity of galaxies is often dubbed
as the galaxy zoo As rst noted by Hubble  Humason 1931 and later quantied
1The nomenclature of early- and late-type is historical and does not reect the current understanding of
galaxy evolution

by several other authors eg Oemler 1974 Davis  Geller 1976 Dressler 1980 the
morphology-density relation holds that star-forming disc-dominated spiral galaxies tend
to reside in regions of lower galaxy density relative to those of red and dead elliptical
42 PROPERTIES OF GALAXIES
galaxies Croton  Farrar 2008 This implies that the environment can affect at least
galaxy morphologies and star formation history Moreover in disk galaxies which are
rotationally supported the galaxy sizes are a measure of their specic angular momenta
while in case of elliptical galaxies which are supported by random motions the sizes are
a measure of the amount of dissipation during their formation Hence the morphologies
and dynamical differences of galaxies have been interpreted as evidence for different
evolutionary histories Kennicutt 1998a
In general it is assumed that the environment local to a galaxy is most fundamental in
determining its morphology The fact that the morphology of a galaxy is closely related
to the density of galaxies in its vicinity also implies that the local environment is of key
importance in the formation and evolution of a galaxy Because groups see Chapter 3
form on time scales of gigayears the morphology-density relation implies that at least
some elliptical and lenticular galaxies are likely to be the result of mergers of spirals
Mergers are therefore probably responsible for a lot of the enhanced early-type fraction
in groups and clusters However secular evolution Sellwood  Merritt 1994 Norman
et al 1996 Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 and disk instabilities can also change the
morphology even in absence of mergers eg Raha et al 1991 Dekel et al 2009b but
see also Figure 28 Disk instabilities form when the disk of the galaxy grows large
enough and becomes unstable Thus morphology alone does not describe the formation
history of a galaxy well though it can give hints from the possible past merging activity
The origin of the morphology-density relation can be a combination of several pro-
cesses ie ram-pressure and tidal stripping strangulation galaxy harassment etc see
for example Tasca et al 2009 Thus whether the inuence of the local environment
is felt at the time of formation or when the galaxy evolves or during both phases is not
yet clear I will however return to the question of environment in Sections 43 and 44
423 Star formation
One of the main questions in the study of galaxy evolution is related to the star formation
rate and history of galaxies and to the physics that triggers star formation eg Kennicutt
1989 Madau et al 1996 1998 Kennicutt 1998a Bouwens et al 2010 Section 28
showed that as the gas in a dark matter halo cools its self-gravity will eventually domi-
nate over that of the dark matter It was noted that in general star formation of a galaxy
can be assumed to be limited by the availability of hydrogen gas that can cool fragment
and form new stars Interestingly though the efciency of the conversion of molecular
gas into stars has been argued to be nearly independent of the galaxy type its large-scale
environment or the particular local conditions within the galaxy eg Rownd  Young
1999 Leroy et al 2008 So what controls the star formation
Based on observations eg Kennicutt 1998a and references therein it has been
argued that star formation takes place in two modes quiescent star formation in gas
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
disks and circumnuclear starburst In the disks of spiral galaxies star formation has been
observed to proceed at a relatively low pace but in a continuous fashion Since gas-rich
spirals are relatively common in the nearby Universe disks must be replenished with in-
fall of gas or otherwise the present time must mark the end of the epoch of star forming
disk galaxies It is also likely that the galaxies that are forming stars at present epoch
have obtained cool molecular hydrogen relatively recently because the typical star for-
mation timescales are  3  4 Gyr Indeed observations eg Solomon  Sanders
1980 Sanders et al 1984 Frayer et al 1998 Papadopoulos et al 2001 Frye et al
2008 suggest that many spiral galaxies such as the Galaxy have a hydrogen gas reser-
voir around them This reservoir is likely to consist of three parts 1 gas that is just
falling onto the halo 2 gas that has already fallen in and been shock heated but which
has not yet cooled radiatively and 3 gas that has been reheated and expelled from the
galaxy due to feedback processes As a consequence galaxies with such reservoir can
form new stars from the gas that infalls from the reservoir to the disk Kormendy  Ken-
nicutt 2004 Additional to infall also gas rich the so-called wet mergers can bring
new gas to a galaxy and induce star formation even at late cosmic times Moreover
mergers of galaxies of a roughly equal size shortly major mergers may also trigger an
exceptionally high rate of star formation or starburst eg Mihos  Hernquist 1996
Unfortunately though the exact role of mergers the composition of molecular gas reser-
voir the form and potential evolution of the IMF briey mentioned in Section 284
and consequently the detailed physics of star formation are not yet well understood If
the exact physical conditions for star formation are not well known can the observations
tell something about the global star formation rate evolution instead
The cosmic star formation rate density SFRD of the Universe has been observed
to evolve signicantly with redshift and to peak at z  2 eg Madau et al 1998 Gi-
avalisco et al 2004 Bouwens et al 2010 2011 This is therefore the epoch when the
majority of galaxies were growing most vigorously and forming stars fastest This is
likely true for todays elliptical galaxies that show little star formation at current epochs
and are therefore often considered to be red and dead However this is also true glob-
ally as the current SFRD is about a factor of ten smaller than at z  2 Bouwens et al
2011 as Fig 42 shows Unfortunately the obscuring effects of dust cast serious un-
certainty over the interpretation of data As a result the star formation rate density as
a function of cosmic time is somewhat uncertain as illustrated by the blue and orange
regions in the Figure Despite the complication due to dust the decline between z  0
and z  2 in the global trend of SFRD is obvious On the other hand however the rate
of decline at high redshifts z  6 is more uncertain This is mainly due to the fact
that currently there are only a handful of galaxy candidates at such high redshifts see
eg Yan et al 2010 Labb et al 2010 Bouwens et al 2011 Moreover usually these
candidates have not been conrmed spectroscopically but rely on the dropout technique
42 PROPERTIES OF GALAXIES
which may suffer from contamination Thus the SFRD of the early Universe will likely
remain an active area of research for years to come
Despite the uncertainties in SFRD it has been argued that the observations indicate
that disk galaxies at higher redshifts have higher specic star formation rates SSFRs
This can be interpreted such that the SFRD is not primarily driven by evolution in the
frequency of starburst but rather reects a decline in the typical SSFRs of star-forming
galaxies for a detailed discussion see eg Mo et al 2010 I will return to this matter
in Section 45

424 Chemical evolution and the age of a galaxy
As already pointed out blue galaxies are dominantly made out of hot young blue stars
As these stars are short lived one could navely assume that blue galaxies are on average
younger than red galaxies Unfortunately though another element closely related to star
formation which is not related to the age of the stellar populations can affect the colour
of a galaxy namely the chemical evolution of stellar populations eg Tinsley 1980 Fall
 Pei 1993 Pei  Fall 1995 Pagel 1997 Pipino  Matteucci 2004 Tantalo et al
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
2010 Tumlinson 2010 that is the production of heavy elements in stars As a result
the chemical properties of galaxies reect the amount of gas that has been processed and
returned by stars As such the metallicities of galaxies and stars forming the galaxies
can serve as a fossil record of their evolution
The chemical evolution of the ISM and IGM eg Matteucci  Greggio 1986
Kauffmann  Charlot 1998 Recchi et al 2001 Oppenheimer  Dav 2006 is im-
portant for several reasons For example it dictates that stars that form later in cosmic
times have in a statistical sense higher abundances of metals2 As a result galaxies
that are forming stars at the current epoch late in cosmic time scales have on average
stellar populations that are more metal rich Population I stars than stellar populations
of non-starforming galaxies Population II stars Note however that if a galaxy can
obtain pristine gas that is gas that has not yet been polluted by metals and such gas is
not mixed with the existing ISM the galaxy can form metal poor stars also at late cosmic
epochs In general though this may not be so simple because the IGM is also assumed
to be metal-enriched
Usually Population I stars have been found to populate the plane of the disk in spiral
galaxies while Population II stars are located in the spheroidal component of galaxies
for a review of stellar populations in the Galaxy see Mould 1982 What does this tell
about the evolution of galaxies Stellar evolutionary models show that typical Pop II
stars are old and of low metallicity As Pop II stars are usually older than  10 Gyr they
must have formed early in the formation history of a galaxy Consequently elliptical
galaxies that are mainly made out of Pop II stars must have formed most of their stars
early Note however that this does not necessarily imply that elliptical galaxies have
also assembled at high redshifts I will return to the formation and assembly times of
elliptical galaxies in Section 444 For now we can conclude that it is likely that the
stellar population that forms an elliptical galaxy has formed a long time ago How about
disk galaxies then
A fraction of Pop I O and B stars are as young as  106 yr implying that the disks
of spiral galaxies assemble by relatively continuous infall of gas The existence of Pop
I stars could also lead us to conclude that spiral galaxies are predominantly blue and
contain a young stellar population While the latter is at least partially true the former
statement is more complicated due to the chemical evolution One should note that a
confusion in the colours and ages of galaxies arise from the fact that metal rich stars ie
Population I stars have lower temperatures than metal poor stars of the same age and
mass and thus they end up looking redder This results in the so-called age-metallicity
degeneracy that complicates the age estimates of all galaxies
The chemical evolution of the gas and stars in galaxies is important also for other
reasons The cooling efciency of gas has been found to depend strongly on its metal-
2In Astronomy every element more massive than helium is called a metal
43 ENVIRONMENTAL DEPENDENCE NATURE VERSUS NURTURE 87
licity as noted in Section 284 As the metal-enriched gas can cool faster the chemical
evolution of galaxies may offset the star formation rates in these galaxies Additionally
the extinction by dust Section 452 which is believed to be produced in the envelopes
of AGB stars and injected into the ISM through stellar winds is assumed to depend on
for example the chemical composition of dust grains Mo et al 2010 Consequently
the amount of dust in the ISM is assumed to scale with its metallicity I will return to
the importance of ISM and dust when discussing the case study of luminous infrared
galaxies in Section 45
43 Environmental dependence nature versus nurture
From the theoretical perspective the environmental dependency can be divided into two
parts those related to the host dark matter halo and those of larger scales laments
sheet etc As discussed in Section 283 the properties of a galaxy are assumed to
depend strongly on the properties of the host halo however the effect of larger scales
are less clear One complication is that the dynamical times on scales signicantly larger
than dark matter haloes are large As a result the gravitational processes have had only
little time to make an impact It is however possible that non-gravitational effects may
play a role so we should not exclude the option lightly Independent of the scale the
complication of studying environmental dependencies arises from the fact that a cor-
relation between galaxy properties and an environmental property does not necessarily
imply causality
Chapter 2 described how dark matter haloes form from the initial quantum density
uctuations of the early Universe It is therefore natural to assume that the formation
place in space affects the halo collapse As a consequence the initial conditions and
the formation place of the dark matter halo should also have an effect on the galaxy that
forms in the centre of the halo The part of galaxy evolution which is imprinted to the
initial conditions of dark matter halo formation is often dubbed as nature Observations
have shown that on average more massive dark matter haloes host more massive galaxies
eg Guzik  Seljak 2002 Prada et al 2003 Hoekstra et al 2004 Conroy et al 2007
Cacciato et al 2009 One simple explanation for such a correlation can be provided
by the argument that more massive haloes form from the larger volumes which contain
more baryons It has also been noted that on average central galaxies in more massive
haloes are also redder and more centrally concentrated Mo et al 2010 These ndings
provide support for the idea that the immediate environment ie the dark matter halo
can affect the evolution of a galaxy residing in it Thus nature should be considered
an important part of galaxy formation and evolution
In Section 283 it was noted that dark matter haloes and galaxies are not static nor do
they remain unaltered throughout the cosmic evolution of Universe Observations eg
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
van Dokkum 2005 Bell et al 2006ba Lin et al 2008 Tacconi et al 2008 Bundy
et al 2009 Kormendy et al 2009 theory and simulations eg Hausman  Ostriker
1978 Lacey  Cole 1993 Hernquist  Mihos 1995 Springel  Hernquist 2005
Boylan-Kolchin et al 2006 Naab et al 2006 Bournaud et al 2007 Fakhouri  Ma
2008 Khochfar  Silk 2009 Stewart et al 2009 have shown that galaxies and dark
matter haloes can merge in dense environments The galaxy properties can therefore be
affected by environment through physical mechanisms acting on galaxies As a result
the surrounding environment of a galaxy and a dark matter halo it resides in should also
have an effect on their evolution The effects directly linked to the physical mechanisms
caused by the environment briey mentioned in Chapter 3 are often described in a
collective manner with a word nurture It therefore seems that also nurture plays a
role at least in the formation and evolution of some galaxies
It is obvious that the properties of galaxies are correlated with their environment
as was noted when discussing the morphology-density relation but what physical pro-
cesses are likely to drive these correlations Interestingly much of the environmental
dependency can be understood in terms of the group environment discussed briey in
Chapter 3 For example observations seem to favour an important role for preprocessing
of galaxies in groups possibly by mergers eg Mihos 2004 by gas-dynamic interac-
tions with warm or hot gas eg Fujita 2004 or by tidal harassment or ram pressure
stripping eg Moore et al 1996 1998 However some evidence eg Kauffmann
et al 2004 Blanton 2006 have accumulated lately that seem to support the opposite
conclusion that the large-scale density eld appears to be less important than what mass
halo hosts the galaxy and what its position is within the halo eg Blanton  Berlind
2007 and references therein Thus it has been argued that environmental effects may
be relatively local even at low density Blanton  Moustakas 2009 Hence the debate
over the roles of nature and nurture and their physical mechanisms continues The envi-
ronmental effects will be discussed next in a context of a case study of isolated elliptical
galaxies
44 A case study isolated eld elliptical galaxies
441 Background
The merger hypothesis Toomre  Toomre 1972 suggests that the product of the merger
of two spiral galaxies will be an elliptical galaxy If this holds then the probability to nd
an elliptical galaxy is larger in environments with high densities and low velocity disper-
sions ie groups of galaxies This is in agreement with the morphology-density relation
that has shown that majority of elliptical galaxies are located in dense regions However
observations eg Smith et al 2004 Reda et al 2004 Hernndez-Toledo et al 2008
Norberg et al 2008 and references therein have shown that elliptical galaxies can also
44 A CASE STUDY ISOLATED FIELD ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES
be found from the eld These galaxies are often dubbed as isolated eld elliptical galax-
ies IfEs and are considered an unusual class among the galaxy zoo because of their
misplacement Hence a study that identies and describes their properties in detail
is important if we are to understand the big picture of the formation and evolution of
elliptical galaxies and the effects of the environment and formation place
442 Observational evidence
In the past two decades several studies based on observations have identied and studied
the properties of isolated eld elliptical galaxies eg Smith et al 2004 Reda et al
2004 Hernndez-Toledo et al 2008 Norberg et al 2008 and references therein In
many of these studies different possible formation scenarios have been proposed see eg
Mulchaey  Zabludoff 1999 Reda et al 2004 2007 ranging from a clumpy collapse
at an early epoch to multiple merging events Also equal-mass mergers of two massive
galaxies or collapsed groups have been suggested
Observational studies have also shown that several IfEs reveal a number of features
such as tidal tails dust shells discy and boxy isophotes and rapidly rotating discs eg
Reduzzi et al 1996 Reda et al 2004 2005 Hau  Forbes 2006 Hernndez-Toledo
et al 2008 indicating recent merger andor accretion events Some observational evi-
dence suggests that some isolated elliptical galaxies may have suffered late dry mergers
Hernndez-Toledo et al 2008 while others could have formed via a major merger of
two massive galaxies Reda et al 2004 2005 A collapsed poor group of a few galaxies
has also been suggested as a possible formation scenario Mulchaey  Zabludoff 1999
but other studies eg Marcum et al 2004 have concluded that isolated systems are un-
derluminous by at least a magnitude compared with objects identied as merged group
remnants In general studies based on observations eg Reda et al 2007 have con-
cluded very broadly that mergers at different redshifts of progenitors of different mass
ratios and gas fractions are needed to reproduce the observed properties of IfEs
Despite the evidence some IfEs do not show any signs of recent merging activity
eg Aars et al 2001 Denicol et al 2005 complicating the picture of IfE formation
even further It is possible that the merging events have happened in distant past and all
signs of these events have been wiped out For some IfEs this is even likely as merger
remnants usually appear morphologically indistinguishable from a typical elliptical 
1 Gyr after the galaxies merged Combes et al 1995 Mihos 1995 In reality however
the merger observability time-scales depend on the method used to identify the merger
as well as the gas fraction pericentric distance and relative orientation of the merging
galaxies Lotz et al 2008 rendering the time-scale in which a merger can still be
observed uncertain As a consequence the lack of observable evidence does not exclude
the possibility of mergers On the other hand it is also possible that some or even all of
these galaxies have initially formed in underdense regions and developed quietly without
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
any major mergers and disturbances It is therefore unclear from the observational point
of view how IfEs form and evolve and whether nature or nurture or both are important
for the evolution of IfEs These questions were the main driver of Paper III which took
advantage of a semi-analytical galaxy formation model to study the physical properties
evolution and formation of IfEs Before discussing the evolution of IfEs in detail lets
briey look into their basic properties and what hints these properties may give about
the evolution of IfEs
443 The basic properties of IfEs
It was noted in Paper III that the number density of isolated eld elliptical galaxies
is as low as  80  106h3 Mpc3 That is a few orders of magnitude lower than
that of local luminous spiral galaxies however as Paper III shows the number density
of IfEs is tightly coupled to the identication criteria adopted For example up to an
order of magnitude more IfEs can be identied if the criteria are relaxed This however
will affect the immediate environment from which the IfEs are identied resulting in
a sample of less isolated galaxies that can have relatively massive companions Hence
one can readily conclude that IfEs are relatively rare objects more isolated ones being
the rarest
Observational studies eg Marcum et al 2004 have found that IfEs show global
blue colours compared to other elliptical galaxies Blue colours can imply that IfEs
have formed on average later than group and cluster elliptical galaxies however a re-
cent merging event or a gas reservoir could have supplied new gas and induced star
formation rendering the integrated colours of the IfEs bluer Moreover due to the colour-
metallicity degeneracy it is unclear whether the blue global colours should be interpreted
as a measure of age or metallicity or both Hence from the observational point of view
it is unclear if blue colours mean that IfEs are younger than cluster ellipticals if their
metallicities are different or both
The median mass weighted age of simulated IfEs was found to be  88 Gyr Paper
III The number density of young mass weighted age  5 Gyr IfEs is extremely low
giving a lower limit for the age of the IfE population These age estimates are in agree-
ment with some observations eg Collobert et al 2006 while others eg Reda et al
2005 Proctor et al 2005 have quoted age estimates around 4 Gyr Note however that
the observational age estimates use a different denition luminosity weighted age than
the values quoted for simulated IfEs rendering a direct comparison less conclusive In
any event Collobert et al 2006 derived a broad range of stellar ages for their IfEs
ranging from  2 to 15 Gyr in a modest agreement with the simulated IfEs of Paper III
The big scatter in age estimates suggest that the formation of IfEs is not concentrated at
a xed epoch which further implies that there may also be a large scatter in the basic
properties of IfEs
44 A CASE STUDY ISOLATED FIELD ELLIPTICAL GALAXIES
Paper III shows that on average IfEs have a few  5 - 20 companion galaxies
This result alone indicates that IfEs should reside in relatively low density environments
unlike groups see Chapter 3 and clusters which usually contain  50 and  200 to
2000 galaxies respectively Moreover when the number of IfE companions is cid46 20
as in the case of the most IfEs most of the surrounding galaxies were found within
 05h1 Mpc from the IfE If IfEs were to reside in cluster-type dark matter haloes
and environment companion galaxies should also be found further away from the IfE
Even though for a given IfE the number of companions is small their properties may
still provide some information for the evolution of IfEs and their dark matter haloes
For example observations eg Reda et al 2004 have found that only the very faint
dwarf galaxies MR  155 appear to be associated with isolated ellipticals On the
contrary simulated IfEs show companion galaxies with a broad range of magnitudes
Deeper observations and larger samples are therefore required to identify more dwarf
companions that should surround IfEs as predicted by simulations based on the CDM
cosmology
The simulated isolated eld elliptical galaxies are mainly found to reside in dark
matter haloes that are lighter than 7  1012h1Mcid12 while even the most massive dark
matter halo hosting an IfE is lighter than 22  1013h1Mcid12 These masses are compa-
rable to a dark matter halo of a small group thus rendering it impossible that IfEs were
collapsed rich groups Memola et al 2009 calculated the total masses of two of their
isolated ellipticals NGC 7052 and NGC 7785 from X-ray observations and quote values
 5  1011Mcid12 and  19  1012Mcid12 respectively These mass estimates agree well
with the masses of dark matter haloes of simulated IfEs giving support for the idea that
IfEs reside inside relatively light dark matter haloes In general galaxies in massive
dark matter haloes tend to form the bulk of their stars already at a very early cosmic
epoch rendering it likely that some IfEs contain younger stellar populations than those
in cluster ellipticals
444 Formation and evolution of IfEs
The large scatter in the ages of IfEs suggest that they have formed at different times and
under different circumstances Is this interpretation correct To quantify the evolution
of IfEs one must rst dene a general set of times related to the formation and evolution
of dark matter haloes and galaxies that reside in the haloes Briey the different times
that are of interest can be dened as follows followed by Lucia  Blaizot 2007
 Assembly time za is the redshift when 50 per cent of the nal stellar mass is
already present in a single galaxy of the merger tree
 Identity time zi is the redshift when the last major the two progenitors both
contain at least 20 per cent of the stellar mass of the descendant galaxy merger
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
occurred
 Formation time zf  is the redshift when 50 per cent of the mass of the stars in the
nal galaxy at z  0 have already formed
 Last merging time zl is the redshift when the last merger occurred
Using these denitions it can be shown for details see Paper III that isolated eld
elliptical galaxies have assembled at lower redshifts than other elliptical galaxies On
average the stars of an IfE assemble to the main halo later than the stars of group and
cluster ellipticals This is in agreement with the conventional theory which states that
higher density areas collapse earlier than less dense areas Note however that in the
hierarchical merger scenario the star formation history related to the formation time
and assembly history of an elliptical galaxy can be very different For example in some
cases the stars that will eventually form a simulated IfE galaxy are present already at
high redshifts high zf  in agreement with some observational ndings eg Reda et al
2005 even though the assembly of the nal galaxy will happen late small za The
results of Paper III also show that IfEs undergo their possible major merging events at
signicantly lower redshifts than group and cluster ellipticals This gives further support
for the conclusion that IfEs assemble late
The mass accretion of IfEs differs from the mass accretion of other elliptical galax-
ies according to the ndings of Paper III In general IfEs seem to form or accrete stars
more efciently than group and cluster ellipticals However oppose to this IfEs seem to
accrete dark matter slightly slower than the comparison galaxies Nevertheless simula-
tions conrm that IfEs form the bulk of their stars at z  2 as suggested in Reda et al
2005 and show that at a redshift of one IfEs have formed over half of their stars stellar
mass and have gathered as much as 80 per cent of their nal dark matter Similarly the
group and cluster ellipticals have on average accreted roughly the same fraction of dark
matter as IfEs at z  1 however IfEs continue to accrete dark matter till z  0 while
the group and cluster ellipticals have gathered  99 per cent of their nal dark matter
already at z  05 All these results point towards a different formation mechanism
for isolated and cluster elliptical galaxies and also suggest that late merging or accretion
events are likely to be a signicant part of the evolution of an IfE
Formation classes
Early theoretical studies predicted that isolated ellipticals are formed in relatively re-
cent mergers of spiral galaxy pairs while large isolated ellipticals may be the result
of the merging of a small group of galaxies eg Jones et al 2000 DOnghia et al
2005 However these results are in disagreement with some observations Section
442 Moreover the result that the majority of IfEs reside in light dark matter haloes
45 A CASE STUDY LUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES
disagrees with the hypothesis of merging of a group Hence the obvious question is if
some IfEs are descendants of merged groups while others have developed more quietly
and what are the possible formation mechanisms
In Paper III three different yet typical formation mechanisms were identied
the rst formation mechanism named solitude the IfE develops quietly without any
major or minor mergers Solitude IfEs start to form later than other IfEs and their dark
matter haloes are usually lighter than haloes of IfEs that form via different mechanisms
The second formation scenario called coupling comprise of IfEs that have undergone
at least one equal sized merger during their evolution The third and the last formation
mechanism identied in Paper III is called cannibalism IfEs of this formation class
undergo several minor and also possibly major mergers during their evolution The
evolution of the cannibal IfEs is signicantly impacted by the merging events and their
dark matter haloes are usually the most massive ones among all IfEs Consequently
they can be collapsed poor groups as suggested by eg Mulchaey  Zabludoff 1999
Interestingly all three formation scenarios are in agreement with selected observations
This shows that the formation of an IfE is not a simple process that could be quantied
using one or two simple quantities Most importantly Paper III also shows that an IfE
can be formed without major mergers This clearly implies that disk instabilities should
be signicant in the evolution of some isolated eld elliptical galaxies
Paper III also discusses possible observational techniques that could distinguish be-
tween each formation class Future observational studies can therefore try to identify
which formation and evolution process might have been the driving force behind the
evolution of an observed IfE Identication of a formation class can further aid in the
quest of understanding the galaxy evolution in different environments and help to attack
the fundamental dichotomy of nature vs nurture
45 A case study luminous infrared galaxies
451 Background
It was noted in Section 28 that galaxies are not made solely of stars Instead a pic-
ture was painted in which the stars that form a galaxy are more likely embedded in
an interstellar medium ISM consisting not only of hot and cold gas but also dust
Consequently one of the most important discoveries from extragalactic observations at
mid- and far-infrared has been the identication of luminous and ultra-luminous infrared
bright galaxies LIRGs LIR  1011Lcid12 and ULIRGs LIR  1012Lcid12 respectively and
they have been studied extensively in the literature eg Rieke  Low 1972 Harwit
et al 1987 Sanders et al 1988 1991 Condon et al 1991 Sanders  Mirabel 1996
Auriere et al 1996 Duc et al 1997 Genzel et al 1998 Lutz et al 1998 Rigopoulou

These objects emit more energy in the infrared  5  500 m than at all other wave-
lengths combined Even though the ultra- luminous infrared galaxies are reasonably
rare objects in the Universe reasonable assumptions about the lifetime of the infrared
phase suggest that a substantial fraction of all galaxies pass through a stage of intense
infrared emission Sanders  Mirabel 1996 and references therein Consequently the
majority of the most luminous galaxies in the Universe emit the bulk of their energy in
the far-infrared rendering IR extremely interesting wavelength regime to study espe-
cially in the context of galaxy formation and evolution
Understanding the IR bright galaxies is especially important because light from
bright young blue stars is often attenuated by dust The rest-frame ultra-violet UV
light of a galaxy may therefore provide a biased view on for example star formation
rate in the galaxy For example the global star formation rate required to explain the
far-infrared and sub-millimetre background appears to be higher than that inferred from
the data in the UV-optical eg Mo et al 2010 The dust attenuated light from blue
stars is however not lost but assumed to be re-radiated thermally at IR wavelengths As
a result a large fraction of radiation of the cosmic star formation is radiated not at UV
but at IR rest-frame wavelengths This has been found to be true to the extent that the
majority of a luminous star-forming galaxys energy is emitted in the IR for a review of
IR bright galaxies see Sanders  Mirabel 1996 It is therefore important to understand
the properties and evolution of IR bright galaxies when trying to understand the cosmic
star formation history and galaxy formation and evolution However before we can
concentrate on these questions the modelling of dust attenuation and emission should
be briey discussed
452 Modelling of dust attenuation and emission
The ISM is assumed to be complex structure see for example the textbooks of Kaplan
 Pikelner 1970 Osterbrock 1989 complicating an accurate modelling of it and its
interactions with the interstellar radiation It is usually assumed however that most of
the dust in the ISM is produced by AGB stars and injected into the ISM through stellar
winds It is therefore likely that the extinction depends on the physical properties of dust
grains which may vary even within a galaxy Obviously it is possible to try to quantify
the dust extinction by using a statistical description and simplied physics For example
in semi-analytical models of galaxy formation Section 284 the dust extinction by
ISM is often assumed to follow simply from the diffuse dust in the disc of a galaxy and
from a second component which is associated with the dense birth clouds surrounding
young star forming regions Charlot  Fall 2000 Such simplication now allows the
computation of the total fraction of the energy emitted by stars that is absorbed by dust
over all wavelengths If one then assumes that all of this absorbed energy is re-radiated
45 A CASE STUDY LUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES
in the IR hereby neglecting scattering one can thereby compute the total IR luminosity
LIR of each galaxy Finally it is then possible to make use of dust emission templates
to determine the spectral energy distribution SED of the dust emission based on the
hypothesis that the shape of the dust SED is well-correlated with LIR The underlying
physical notion is that the distribution of dust temperatures is set by the intensity of the
local radiation eld thus more luminous or actively star forming galaxies should have a
larger proportion of warm dust as observations eg Sanders  Mirabel 1996 seem to
There are two basic kinds of approaches for constructing these sorts of templates
The rst is to use a dust model along with either numerical or analytic solutions to the
standard radiative transfer equations to create a library of templates calibrated by com-
parison with local prototypes This approach was pioneered by Desert et al 1990 who
posited three main sources of dust emission polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs
very small grains and big grains The latter are composed of graphite and silicates
with small and big grains probably dominated by graphite and silicate respectively The
thermal properties of each species are determined by the size distribution and thermal
state Big grains are assumed to be in near thermal equilibrium and their emission can
be modelled as a modied black-body spectrum However small grains and PAHs are
probably in a state that is intermediate between thermal equilibrium and single photon
heating They are therefore subject to temperature uctuations and their emission spec-
tra are much broader than a modied black-body spectrum In the Desert et al 1990
type approach the detailed size distributions are modelled using free parameters which
are calibrated by requiring the model to t a set of observational constraints such as the
extinction or attenuation curves observed IR colours and the IR spectra of local galaxies
The second approach is to make direct use of observed SEDs eg Chary  Elbaz 2001
Dale et al 2001 Rieke et al 2009 for a set of prototype galaxies and to attempt to
interpolate between them allowing to determine the SED of the dust emission Finally
after a proper SED of the dust emission has been derived it can be used together with
the total IR luminosity of a given galaxy to compute the ux of the galaxy at any given
IR band
453 The physical properties of luminous infrared galaxies
Although the brightness of a galaxy at a given band is relatively simple to derive from
observations the physical properties are often more important quantities for galaxy for-
mation and evolution However when deriving physical properties from observational
data several assumptions are usually required A priori predictions are therefore of-
ten useful when interpreting observational results and drawing conclusions Predictions
for physical properties such as sizes of late-type galaxies stellar masses star formation
rates and merger activity of IR bright galaxies are therefore briey discussed
CHAPTER 4 GALAXY EVOLUTION
The simulated galaxies of Paper IV imply that on average more massive disk galax-
ies have larger disks This trend however seems to be driven mainly by the galaxies
with less massive stellar populations log10Mcid63Mcid12  105 Consequently the trend
mostly disappears when limiting to only IR bright galaxies with 250 m ux S250  5
mJy The late-type high-redshift galaxies contain stellar disks which on average are
 22 kpc in size This is signicantly larger than the mean disk size  09 kpc of all
late-type galaxies in the same redshift range 2  z  4 This small disk size for all
high-redshift late-type galaxies is however driven by the galaxies with the lightest stellar
disks as their number density is highest which on average contain the smallest disks
However even if the stellar masses are matched the average size of all disk galaxies
is almost a factor of two smaller  13 kpc than the mean disk size of the IR bright
galaxies This implies that at high-redshift IR bright galaxies contain on average larger
stellar disks than their IR faint counterparts Interestingly thought the largest disks are
not always associated with galaxies with the highest stellar masses Instead they seem
to be distributed rather equally for all stellar masses Thus the formation of stellar ma-
terial while important in general is not the only quantity important for sizes of stellar
disks of IR bright galaxies Even so Paper IV shows that at high redshift 2  z  4
the IR observations are likely to probe the galaxies with the highest stellar masses This
will obviously bias the observational results if not taken into account as only the tip of
the iceberg is being probed
Paper IV also shows that at lower redshifts z  05 the IR bright galaxies can
be found to reside in dark matter haloes as light as log10MDMMcid12  110 Instead
at higher redshifts 2  z  4 Paper IV predicts that all galaxies with S250  5
mJy reside in relatively massive dark matter haloes Even so it should be noted that the
masses of dark matter haloes cover a broad range from log10MDMMcid12  115 to 135
at higher redshifts Despite the broad range the bulk of IR bright galaxies can be found
to reside in dark matter haloes with masses log10MDMMcid12  125 Interestingly
the simulated galaxies show evidence for a weak correlation between the dark matter
halo mass and the 250 micron IR ux Statistically speaking galaxies residing in more
massive dark matter haloes emit a higher median IR ux however this trend was noted
to be weak Moreover for the high-redshift galaxies 2  z  4 with S250  5 mJy no
statistically signicant correlation can be conrmed Thus something else than what is
directly linked to the mass of a dark matter halo must drive the IR ux
If dark matter halo masses and stellar disk sizes show only weak correlations with
the IR uxes at best how about star formation It is hardly surprising that on average the
250 micron IR ux correlates well with a star formation rate SFR the higher the me-
dian S250 ux the higher the star formation rate eg Paper IV and references therein
When moving towards earlier cosmic times it becomes clear that higher and higher star
formation rates are required for galaxies to be detected in currently available IR observa-
45 A CASE STUDY LUMINOUS INFRARED GALAXIES
tions At z  2 the galaxies directly detectable for example with Herschel have median
star formation rates  30Mcid12yr1 while the average SFR is  150Mcid12yr1 This is
signicantly higher than for all galaxies in the same redshift range for which Paper IV
predicts a mean SFR of merely  2Mcid12yr1 For high-redshift IR bright galaxies the
highest star formation rates predicted are as high as a few thousand Mcid12yr1 raising an
interesting question what can cause and fuel such high star formation rates
454 Merger activity
Paper IV shows that at high redshift 2  z  4 the majority of IR bright S250  5
mJy galaxies has experienced a merger during their formation process To be precise
out of all high redshift IR bright galaxies  85 per cent have merged with another galaxy
at some point in their formation history This alone however does not yet imply that a
merger activity would be behind the high star formation rates When only concentrating
on major3 mergers that are assumed to trigger starburst Section 283 it was noted that
about half of the IR bright galaxies had experienced a major merger These results show
that a large fraction of all IR bright galaxies have experienced a major merger and as a
consequence experienced a starburst Could this be the reason for high SFRs
As starbursts are usually relatively short lived phenomenon more important quantity
than the fraction of mergers to look for is the time since the last merger Paper IV
shows that about 84 53 per cent of high-redshift galaxies with S160  10 mJy have
experienced a major merger during their lifetime Note however that the fraction
drops to about 34 percent if we concentrate on major mergers that have taken place less
than 250 Myr ago which are the mergers that are likely to be causally linked to high
star formation rates For the 250 micron band the results are very similar about 86
57 per cent of high-redshift galaxies with S250  20 mJy have experienced a major
merger If we again concentrate only on recent mergers in which the major merging
event took place less than 250 Myr ago the merger fraction drops to  42 per cent
Thus the model used in Paper IV makes an interesting prediction a signicant fraction
half or more of IR-luminous galaxies at high redshift z  2 have not experienced
a recent merger This implies that the high gas accretion rates and efcient feeding via
cold ows predicted by cosmological simulations at high redshift can fuel a signicant
fraction of the galaxies detected by Herschel Interestingly this appears consistent with
preliminary observational results of Sturm et al 2010 who concluded that their two
galaxies add support to recent results which indicate that with an increased gas reservoir
star forming galaxies at high redshifts can achieve ultra-high luminosities without being
major mergers However as the samples are still small more observational evidence is
required for more robust conclusions
3A major merger is here dened as a galaxy-galaxy merger in which the mass ratio of the merging pair
is  1  4

46 Summaries of Papers III and IV
461 Summary of Paper III
In Paper III isolated eld elliptical galaxies IfEs were studied in detail by using cosmo-
logical N-body simulations Elliptical galaxies are usually found to be red and located in
dense environments such as cores of groups and clusters of galaxies unlike IfEs Hence
the obvious question Paper III sought answer to was how do elliptical galaxies form in
underdense regions
Paper III shows that the formation of isolated eld elliptical galaxies is not linked to
fossil groups albeit this has been suggested before as they reside in signicantly lighter
dark matter haloes This also renders the argument also suggested in literature that
the majority of IfEs are progenitors of collapsed groups impossible Instead simula-
tions show that three different yet typical formation scenarios can lead to an IfE all in
agreement with current observations It was also noted in Paper III that IfEs have high
baryon to dark matter fractions making IfEs therefore good candidates for studies of
dark matter poor haloes and their host galaxies
The most signicant result of Paper III is a prediction of a previously unobserved
population of faint and blue isolated eld elliptical galaxies This population comprises
 25 per cent of all IfEs thus a signicant number of IfEs identied from simulations
seem to be missing in observations although see Kannappan et al 2009 for possible
candidates Deeper observations of the surroundings of faint and blue elliptical galaxies
are required if we are to identify this population Moreover these galaxies show signi-
cant star formation and can therefore be important for the study of evolution of elliptical
galaxies as a whole Thus an effort to identify them in the future should be made using
for example large redshift surveys or dedicated observations
462 Summary of Paper IV
With the Herschel space observatory we can nally probe the infrared light of faint
galaxies all the way from 70 to 500 microns Unfortunately at such long wavelengths
contamination and crowding becomes often a limiting factor rather than the depth of the
observations This is especially true at higher redshifts Interpretation of IR observations
can therefore be complicated and less than robust To help to overcome such complica-
tions a theoretical study of high-redshift 2  z  4 infrared luminous galaxies was
undertaken in Paper IV The simulated galaxies of Paper IV were generated using a semi-
analytical galaxy formation model and they were used to study the evolution of galaxies
in the Herschel IR bands and to make detailed predictions for the physical properties
and evolution of luminous IR galaxies in hope that the study could help to shed some
light on galaxy evolution Specically the goal of Paper IV was to present quantitative
46 SUMMARIES OF PAPERS III AND IV
predictions for the relationship between the observed SPIRE 250 micron ux and phys-
ical quantities such as halo mass stellar mass cold gas mass star formation rate and
total infrared luminosity at different redshifts The goal was also to quantify the corre-
lation between SPIRE 250 micron ux and the probability that a galaxy has experienced
a recent major or minor merger
Results of Paper IV imply for example that SPIRE detectable galaxies are on aver-
age signicantly larger than IR faint galaxies with comparable stellar masses The results
also show that in case of luminous IR galaxies the largest stellar disks are not always as-
sociated with the galaxies of the highest stellar masses If so how has all the stellar mass
formed then Not surprisingly Paper IV shows that at high redshift 2  z  4 the av-
erage star formation rate of luminous IR galaxies is relatively high  150Mcid12yr1
For high-redshift galaxies the highest SFRs found from the simulation are as high as a
few thousand Mcid12yr1 leading to the question what fuels such a rapid star formation
Paper IV tries to answer this question and shows that about 80 per cent of the sim-
ulated high-redshift IR bright galaxies have experienced a recent merger Almost 40
per cent of these mergers have been major events that are assumed to trigger starburst
emphasising the importance of major mergers for IR brightness Furthermore Paper
IV nds a fairly strong trend between the 250 micron ux and the probability that a
galaxy has had a recent merger indicating that brighter galaxies are more likely to be
merger driven However also the interesting result was found that in the model a sig-
nicant fraction half or more of IR-luminous galaxies at high redshift z  2 have
not experienced a recent major merger This implies that high gas accretion rates and
efcient feeding via cold ows may fuel a signicant fraction of the galaxies detected
by Herschel
