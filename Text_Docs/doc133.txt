Abstract
Spiral galaxies oer a unique opportunity to study the
role of star formation in galaxy evolution and to test var-
ious theoretical star formation schemes I review some re-
cent relevant work on the evolution of spiral galaxies De-
tailed models are used for the chemical and spectrophoto-
metric evolution with metallicity dependent stellar yields
tracks and spectra The models are calibrated on the
Milky Way disk and generalised to other spirals with some
simple scaling relations obtained in the framework of Cold
Dark Matter models for galaxy formation The results
compare favourably to the main observables of present
day spirals provided a crucial assumption is made mas-
sive disks form their stars earlier than low mass ones It is
not clear whether this picture is compatible with currently
popular hierarchical models of galaxy evolution The re-
sulting abundance gradients are found to be anticorrelated
to the disk scalelength support radially dependent star
formation eciencies and point to a kind of homologu-
ous evolution for spirals

1 Introduction
to irregulars spirals present gradients of various quantities
metal abundances colours gas and SFR proles which
may constrain various theoretical schemes for the local
SFR iii last but not least our own Milky Way is a typical
spiral rather well understood
In this paper I will summarize some recent work made
on the role of star formation in the evolution of spiral
galaxies In Sec 2 a brief overview is presented of the cur-
rent status of SFR observations in spirals based mostly on
the work of Kennicutt 1998 in particular it is pointed
out that a radial dependence of the star formation e-
ciency is compatible both with observations of the Milky
Way and with theoretical ideas In Sec 3 I present a
model developed recently for the study of the chemical and
spectrophotomeric evolution of disk galaxies The model
utilises metallicity dependent stellar evolution data yields
tracks spectra a radially varying SFR calibrated on
the Milky Way and describes galactic disks as a 2-parameter
family the two parameters being maximal rotational ve-
locity VC and spin parameter  The model compares
favourably to all currently available observations of nearby
spirals provided a crucial assumption is made massive
disks form their stars earlier than low mass ones This is
supported by the nding that low mass disks have today
larger gas fractions than their high mass counterparts de-
spite the fact that the star formation eciency seems to
be independent of galactic mass
Among the three main ingredients required for galactic
evolution studies stellar evolution data stellar initial mass
function and star formation rate the star formation rate
SFR is the most important and the less well under-
stood Despite more than 30 years of observational and
theoretical work the Schmidt law still remains popular
among theoreticians and compatible with most available
observations Up to the mid-90ies observations revealed
features concerning the present status of nearby galaxies
from which their past history had to be derived Develop-
ments in the past few years revealed features of the global
SFR of the Universe and opened perspectives for seing
directly the past SFR history of the various galaxy types
Among the various galaxy types the disks of spirals
are certainly the ones oering the best opportunities to
study star formation for several reasons i with respect
to ellipticals spirals oer more constraints amounts of gas
and SFR metal abundances in the gas ii with respect
2 Star formation in disk galaxies
A nice account of the various diagnostic methods used to
derive the SFR in galaxies is given in the recent review of
Kennicutt 1998 on which most of the material of this
section is based
Integrated colours and spectra were used in the past to
estimate the SFR through population synthesis models
This method is still applied to multi-colour observations
of faint galaxies but has been supplanted by direct tracers
of SFR measurements of integrated light in the UV and
the FIR or of nebular recombination line intensities Each
one of the direct tracers presents its own advantages and
drawbacks and an appropriate calibration is not always
The UV continuum optimal range 1250-2500 A traces
directly the emissivity of a young stellar population and
can be applied to star-forming galaxies over a wide range

tivity normalised to galaxys mass for a large sample of

ues of the stellar birthrate parameter b which is the ratio
of the present SFR to that averaged over the past from
Kennicutt 1998
of redshifts It is however very sensitive to extinction and
the relevant corrections which may reach several magni-
tudes are dicult to calibrate This is also true for the
diagnostics based on recombination lines these lines re-
emit eectively the integrated stellar luminosity of galax-
ies shortward of the Lyman limit since ionizing ux is
produced almost exclusively by stars with M10 M the
derived SFR is very sensitive to the slope of the upper
mass part of the adopted IMF In fact sensitivity to the
IMF is a common feature of all SFR diagnostic methods
In the case of the FIR continuum emitted by interstellar
dust that has been heated by absorption of stellar light
the situation is complicated by the fact that dust may ei-
ther surround young star-forming regions or be heated by
the general interstellar radiation eld in the former case
FIR really measures the SFR but the situation is less clear
in the latter FIR seems then to provide an excellent mea-
sure of the SFR in dusty circumnuclear starbursts but its
application to normal disk galaxies is not straightforward
Figure 2 Schematic illustration of the evolution of the
stellar birthrate for dierent Hubble types The left panel
shows the evolution of the relative SFR with time follow-
ing Sandage 1986 The curves for spiral galaxies are ex-
ponentially declining SFRs that t the mean values of the
birthrate parameter b measured by Kennicutt et al 1994
The curve for elliptical galaxies and bulges corresponds to
an e-folding time of 05 Gyr and is shown for comparative
purposes only The right panel shows the corresponding
evolution in SFR with redshift for an assumed cosmolog-
ical density parameter  03 and an assumed formation
redshift z  5 from Kennicut 1998
This trend should reect the underlying past star for-
mation histories of disks which can be parametrised by b
the ratio of current SFR to the past SFR averaged over
the age of the disk ie Scalo 1986 Parameter b derived
on the basis of population synthesis models appears on
the right axis scale of Fig 1 Typical late type disks have
formed stars at roughly constant rates b 1 while early
type spirals formed their stars quite early b 001-01
A schematic illustration of the corresponding star for-
mation histories is presented in Fig 2 On the left panel
are shown the histories of typical ellipticals and bulges
of spirals and of the disks of Sa Sb and Sc galaxies
Obviously in this simple picture the Hubble sequence is
uniquely determined by the caracteristic time scale of star
formation
These techniques have been used to derive the SFR
in hundreds of nearby galaxies thus revealing several in-
teresting trends of star formation along the Hubble se-
quence In Fig 1 is plotted the equivalent width EW of
the HNII lines dened as the emission line luminos-
ity devided by the adjacent continuum ux which is a
measure of the relative SFR ie the SFR normalised by
unit stellar luminosity in the red There is a strong dis-
persion at each Hubble type by a factor of 10 but also
a trend of increase of the mean value by a factor of 20
between types Sa and Sc
This simple description of the Hubble sequence fails to
answer two important and probably related questions
i what determines the caracteristic time scales for star
formation and ii what is the role if any of a galaxys
mass in this picture Gavazzi et al 1996 have found an
anti-correlation between the SFR per unit mass and the
galaxy luminosity Part of this trend may reect the same
dependence of SFR on Hubble type shown in Fig 1 but
it may also be that these trends are fundamentally related
to the galactic mass We shall come to this point in the
next section

points denote normal spirals squares denote circumnu-
clear starbursts The open circles show the SFRs and gas
densities of the central regions of the normal disks Right
The same SFR data are plotted against the ratio of the
gas density to the average orbital time in the disk from
Kennicutt 1998
Although it is not yet clear what is the main factor
aecting the SFR it seems that on large scales there is a
correlation between the SFR and the gaseous content of
galaxies and starbursts When the average SFR density
hi is plotted vs the average gas surface density hGi a
Schmidt-type law is recovered hi  hGiN  with N 15
Fig 3 left panel Such a law is expected if the SFR is
proportional to F F where  is the mass density and
F F  12 is the free-fall time scale and provided the
disk has a constant scale height such as hGi   How-
ever Kennicut 1998 nds that the data in Fig 3 can be
equally well t by hi  hGi where  is the frequency
of rotation of the disk measured at half the outer radius
ROUT  As noticed by Kennicutt 1998 these dierent
parametrisations lead to dierent interpretations for the
average eciency   hihGi of star formation In the
former case one has   hGiN 1 ie the eciency is de-
termined by the average gas surface density in the latter
case we have    ie  is determined by how much mass
contributes to the gravitational potential inside ROUT 2
These ndings are extremely useful for one-zone mod-
els of galaxy evolution treating the galaxy as a whole
However they are of limited help for multi-zone models
of disk evolution which require prescriptions for the local
SFR R not the average one If the local SFR is non-
linear wrt the gas surface density the resulting average
SFR over the whole disk will have no simple relation to
the local one Although hi can be derived from R
the inverse does not hold
A radial dependence of the star formation eciency
in disk galaxies is required in order to reproduce the ob-
served abundance and colour gradients see Sec 4 and

molecular H2 and atomic HI hydrogen in the Milky
Way as a function of galactocentric radius and total gas

ical current SFR solid curve and comparison to obser-
vational estimates of the current SFR prole The SFR
proles are normalised to their value at RS8 kpc from
Boissier and Prantzos 1999
such a dependence has indeed been proposed on the ba-
sis of various instability criteria for gaseous disks eg
Talbot and Arnett 1975 Onihishi 1975 Wyse and Silk
1989 Dopita and Ryder 1994 It should be noted that
star formation theories exist and may be tested mainly
for disk galaxies not for eg ellipticals or irregulars A
star formation rate explicitly dependent on galactocentric
radius has been suggested by Onihishi 1975 It is based
on the idea that stars are formed in spiral galaxies when
the interstellar medium with angular frequency R is
periodically compressed by the passage of the spiral pat-
tern having a frequency P const R This leads
to SFR  R  P  R and for disks with at
rotation curves to SFR  R1 Wyse and Silk 1989 In
recent works Prantzos and Silk 1998 Boissier and Prant-
zos 1999 we used for the Milky Way disk a local SFR of
the form
R  01 GR15 RRS1 Mpc2Gyr1
where RS8 kpc is the distance of the Sun to the Galac-
tic centre Such a radial dependence of the SFR is also
compatible with observational evidence as can be seen in
Fig 4 displaying the current gas surface density prole in
the Milky Way disk upper panel and the corresponding
SFR lower pannel comparison of this theoretical SFR
to observations lower panel in Fig 4 shows a fairly good
agreement It has been shown that this form of the SFR
can account for the observed gradients of gas fraction

can be expressed in terms of the one of our Galaxy the
parameters of which are designated hereafter by index G
3 A model for disk evolution
In our models the galactic disk is simulated as an ensem-
ble of concentric independently evolving rings gradually
built up by infall of primordial composition The chemical
evolution of each zone is followed by solving the appro-
priate set of integro-dierential equations Tinsley 1980
without the Instantaneous Recycling Approximation Stel-
lar yields are from Woosley and Weaver 1995 for massive
stars and Renzini and Voli 1981 for intermediate mass
stars Fe producing SNIa are included their rate being
calculated with the prescription of Matteucci and Greggio
1986 The adopted stellar IMF is a multi-slope power-
law between 01 M and 100 M from the work of Kroupa
et al 1993
The spectrophotometric evolution is followed in a self-
consistent way ie with the SFR t and metallicity Zt
of each zone determined by the chemical evolution and
the same IMF The stellar lifetimes evolutionary tracks
and spectra are metallicity dependent the rst two are
from the Geneva library Schaller et al 1992 Charbon-
nel et al 1996 and the latter from Lejeune et al 1997
Dust absorption is included according to the prescriptions
of Guiderdoni et al 1998 and assuming a sandwich
conguration for the stars and dust layers Calzetti et al
31 Scaling relations and results
In order to extend the Milky Way model to other disk
galaxies we adopt the scaling properties derived by Mo
Mao and White 1998 hereafter MMW98 in the frame-
work of the Cold Dark Matter CDM scenario for galaxy
formation According to this scenario primordial density
uctuations give rise to haloes of non-baryonic dark mat-
ter of mass M  within which baryonic gas condenses later
and forms disks of maximum circular velocity VC  It turns
out that disk proles can be expressed in terms of only two
parameters rotational velocity VC measuring the mass
of the halo and by assuming a constant halodisk mass
ratio also the mass of the disk and spin parameter 
measuring the specic angular momentum of the halo
In fact a third parameter the redshift of galaxy forma-
tion depending on galaxys mass is playing a key role in
all hierarchical models of galaxy formation However since
the term time of galaxy formation is not well dened is
it the time that the rst generation of stars form or the
time that some fraction of the stars eg 50 form we
prefer to ignore it and assume that all disks start forming
their stars at the same time but not at the same rate In
that case the prole of a given disk caracterised by the
central surface density 0 and the disk scalelength Rd

is of little importance as far as it is close to the peak of he
corresponding distribution function see next paragraph
since our disk proles and results depend only on the ratio
G
Eqs 2 allow to describe the mass prole of a galactic
disk in terms of the one of our Galaxy and of two parame-
ters VC and  The range of observed values for the former
parameter is 80-360 kms whereas for the latter numerical
simulations give values in the 001-01 range the distribu-
tion peaking around   004 MMW98 Although it is
not clear yet whether VC and  are independent quanti-
ties we treat them here as such and construct a grid of 25
models caracterised by VC  80 150 220 290 360 kms
and   001 003 005 007 009 respectively Notice if
G006 is adopted for the Milky Way our model results
would be the same but they would correspond to values
of  twice as large ie 002 006 010 014 and 018
respectively Increasing values of VC correspond to more
massive disks and increasing values of  to more extended
disks Fig 5

curve for our disk models Each column corresponds to a value of  and each row to a value of VC  The dotted curve
is an exponential t to the SFR from Boissier and Prantzos 2000
We calculate the corresponding rotational velocity curves
V R of our model disks assuming contributions from the
disk and an isothermal dark halo The local SFR is then
calculated self-consistently as
t R   gt R15 V R R1
It can be seen that the corresponding star formation ef-
ciency at the caracteristic radius Rd does not depend
on VC for a given  In other terms the adopted SFR
law is important only for the resulting gradients but not
for the global properties of galaxies In our models the
timescale for star formation is aected by the adopted in-
fall timescale adjusted as to form massive disks earlier
than less massive ones this most important ingredient is
discussed in Sec 32 and 4
The evolution of the SFR and of the gaseous and stel-
lar masses in our 25 disk models is shown in Fig 6 This
evolution results from the adopted prescriptions for in-
fall and SFR Values of SFR range from 100 Myr in
the early phases of massive disks to 01 Myr for the
lowest mass galaxies The resulting SFR history is par-
ticularly interesting when compared to simple models of
photometric evolution that are usually applied in studies
of galaxy evolution and of their cosmological implications
Such models one-zone no chemical evolution considered
in general adopt exponentially declining SFR with dif-
ferent caracteristic timescales for each galaxy morpholog-
ical type eg Bruzual  Charlot 1993 Fioc and Rocca-
Volmerange 1997
The fact that in some cases the SFR increases in time
leads us to dene the time-scale  required for forming
the rst half of the stars of a given galaxy This time scale
for star formation appears in Fig 7 plotted as a func-
tion of  left and VC right It can be seen that  is
a monotonically increasing function of  and a decreas-
ing function of VC  For the Milky Way VCG220 kms
G003 we nd  35 Gyr For galaxies less massive
than the Milky Way and   006 it takes more than half
the age of the Universe to form the rst half of their stars
Assuming that all our model disks started forming
their stars 13 Gyr ago we present in Fig 8 their in-
tegrated properties today at redshift z0 Several inter-
esting results can be pointed out
1 For a given  the stellar and gaseous masses are
monotonically increasing functions of VC  For a given VC
disks may have considerably dierent gaseous and stellar
contents by factors 30 and 5 respectively depending on
how compact they are ie on their  value The more
compact galaxies have always a smaller gaseous content
This is well illustrated by the behaviour of the gas fraction

2 The current SFR 0 is found to be mostly a func-
tion of VC alone despite the fact that the amount of gas

varies by a factor of 2-3 for a given VC  This is due to
the fact that more extended disks higher  are less ef-
cient in forming stars because of the 1Rd factor for
a given VC  This smaller eciency compensates for the
larger gas mass available in those galaxies and a unique
value is obtained for 0 This immediately implies that
little scatter is to be expected in the B-magnitude vs VC
relation and this is indeed the case as can be seen in Fig
8 middle right panel For that reason we nd litle scatter
in the corresponding Tully-Fisher relation which is in fair
agreement with available data in various wavelength bands
as discussed in detail in Boissier and Prantzos 2000
3 The mass to light ratio   ML is a quantity of-
ten used to probe the age andor the IMF of the stellar
population and the amount of dark matter but also to
convert results of dynamical models ie mass into ob-
served quantities ie light in various wavelength bands
Our models upper middle of Fig 8 lead to fairly accept-
able values of B and I these values are conned to
a relatively narrow range and a systematic albeit weak
trend is obtained with galaxys mass that should not be
neglected in detailed models
4 Most of our model disks have a roughly constant
current central surface brightness B0 215 mag arcsec2
This is quite an encouraging result in view of the ob-
served constancy of the central surface brightness in disks
around the Freeman value B021703 mag arcsec2
Freeman 1970 this value is indicated by the grey band
in Fig 8 top right panel Finally models with 007
and 009 result in low surface brightness LSB galaxies
32 Comparison to observations
As explained in Sec 31 our model disks are described by
the central surface density 0 and scalelength Rd These
are related to the fundamental parameters VC and 
fundamental because they refer to the dark matter haloes
through the scaling relations 2 which allow to use the
Milky Way as a calibrator
In Fig 9 we present the r-band central surface bright-
ness upper panel and size lower panel of our model
disks as a function of the galaxys luminosity and we com-

of the spin parameter  left and of circular velocity VC
right Filled points correspond to the Milky Way from
Boissier and Prantzos 2000
pare them to the data of Courteau and Rix 1999 It can
be seen that
i The central surface brightness in our models com-
pares fairly well to the data For a given value of  r0
is quasi-independent on luminosity or VC  as explained
in Sec 31 The obtained values depend on  the more
compact disks being brighter All the observed values are
lower than our results of 001 models Higher  values
bracket reasonably well the data
ii The size of our model disks decreases with decreas-
ing luminosity with a slope which matches again the ob-
servations fairly well Our disk sizes range from Rd 6-10
kpc for the most luminous galaxies to 1-2 kpc for the less
luminous ones The 001 curve clearly lies too low wrt
all data points showing once more that this  value does
not produce realistic disks it rather produces bulges or
elliptical galaxies
In Fig 10 we compare our results to the data of Mc-
Gaugh and deBlok 1997 concerning gas fraction vs var-
ious photometric quantities The following points can be
1 We nd indeed a trend between gas fraction and ab-
solute magnitude smaller and less luminous galaxies are in
general more gas rich as can also be seen in Fig 8 bottom
left panel Our grid of models covers reasonnably well the
range of observed values except for the lowest luminosity
galaxies see also points 2 and 3 below In particular the
slope of the g vs MB relation of our models is similar
to the one in the t to the data given by McGaugh and
deBlok 1997
2 We nd that the observed g vs B-V relation can
also be explained in terms of galaxys mass ie more mas-
Figure 9 Central surface brightness upper panel and disk
size Rd lower panel in the r-band as a function of the
galaxys magnitude Mr Our results are parametrised by
the values of the spin parameter  001 models produce
unrealistically small disks with very high surface brightness
and correspond rather to galactic bulges from Boissier
and Prantzos 2000
sive galaxies are redder and have smaller gas fractions
Indeed the slope of the g vs B-V relation -14 is again
well reproduced by our models and the 005 models
lead to results that match close the observations How-
ever although our grid of models reproduces well the ob-
served dispersion in g it does not cover the full range of
B-V values The lowest B-V values correspond to gas rich
galaxies g  05-08 and could be explained by models
with higher  values than those studies here ie by very
Low Surface Brightness galaxies
3 The situation is radically dierent for the g vs
B0 relation As already seen in Fig 8 top right panel
we nd no correlation in our models between B0 and
VC  but we do nd one between B0 and  more compact
disks lower  have higher central surface brightness It is
this latter property that allows our models to reproduce
at least partially the observed g vs B0 relation right
panel of Fig 10
Another probe of the evolutionary status of a galactic
disk is its metallicity Both its absolute value and its ra-
dial prole can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish
between dierent models of galactic evolution
In Fig 11 we plot our results at the same caracteristic
radii as Zaritsky et al 1994 ie at 3 kpc at 04 0 and at
08 Rd from top to bottom respectively as a function of
circular velocity VC left panels and of MB right panels

the spin parameter  solid curves and 5 values for the
circular velocity dashed curves as indicated on the left
panel Values of VC run from 80 kms open triangle to
360 kms lled triangle Results of models are given at
a galactic age of 135 Gyr Data in all panels are from
McGaugh and DeBlok 1997 Filled symbols correspond
to high surface brightness galaxies and open symbols to low
surface brightness galaxies Our grid of models clearly does
not t the lowest surface brightness galaxies ie below
BO23 mag arcsec2 which probably require values of

It can be seen that a correlation is always found in our
models between abundances Z and VC or MB stronger
in the case of Z3 kpc than in the other two cases Only
in the 001 models unrealistic for disks as stressed
already Z08 Rd is not correlated with either MB or
VC  Except for that the grid of our models reproduces
fairly well the data both concerning absolute values and
slopes of the correlations
33 Star formation efficiency
The agreement of our models to such a large body of obser-
vational data see Boissier and Prantzos 2000 for details
is impressive taking into account the small number of free
parameters Indeed the only really free parameter is the
dependence of the infall timescale on galactic mass since
all other ingredients are xed by the calibration of the
model to the Milky Way disk
We notice that our assumption about infall timescales
leads to massive disks forming their stars earlier than less
massive ones We also notice that this is not due to the
corresponding star formation SF eciency As already
stressed in Sec 31 the eciency of our adopted SFR is in-
dependent of VC for a given  value This assumption is
justied by the data of Fig 12 lower panel The observed

from Boissier and Prantzos 2000
current global SF eciency of disk galaxies measured by
the ratio of the SFR to the mass of gas seems to be in-
dependent of VC  in fair agreement with our models of
course higher  values correspond to lower eciencies
On the other hand Fig 12 upper panel shows also
the corresponding gas fraction as a function of VC  lower
mass disks have proportionately more gas than massive
ones When the two panels of Fig 12 are compared there
is only one possible logical conclusion massive galaxies
formed their stars earlier than their low mass counter-
partsThus they transformed a larger fraction of their gas
to stars and have today a redder stellar population and a
higher metallicity at a given radius Notice The underly-
ing assumption is that the SF eciency has not varied by
much during the disk history but if current SF ecien-
cies are similar for such a large range of galaxy masses and
metallicities it is dicult to see why the situation should
have been very dierent in the past
These features are not easy to accomodate in the frame-
work of currently popular hierarchical models of galaxy
formation and evolution For instance the observed red-

der colours of more massive disks are usually interpreted
in such models by invoking the presence of large amounts
of dust eg Somerville and Primack 1999 Although there
is no doubt that the more massive the galaxy the larger
is the overall amount of gas and dust see Fig 8 the
eect should not be overestimated Indeed current evi-
dence suggests that galactic disks are optically thin eg
Xilouris et al 1997 Moreover the fact that the Milky
Way is redder than the Magellanic Clouds is certainly
not due to its larger dust content
4 Abundance gradients in spirals
Almost all large spiral galaxies present sizeable radial abun-
dance gradients This is for instance the case for the
Milky Way disk showing an oxygen abundance gradient
of dlogOHdR-007 dexkpc in both its gaseous and
stellar components The origin of these gradients is still
a matter of debate A radial variation of the star forma-
tion rate SFR or the existence of radial gas ows or
a combination of these processes can lead to abundance
gradients in disks eg Henry and Worthey 1999 and ref-
erences therein On the other hand the presence of a
central bar inducing large scale mixing through radial gas

90ies eg Friedli et al 1998 and references therein the
relative importance of these processes has not been clari-
ed yet
In Fig 13 we compare our results to the observations
of Garnett et al 1997 and van Zee et al 1998 concern-
ing abundance gradients in external spirals ie observa-
tions of OH in HII regions as a function of galactocentric
distance
In the upper panel abundance gradients are expressed
in dexkpc Observations show that luminous disks have
small gradients while as we go to low luminosity ones
the absolute value of the gradients and their dispersion
increase This trend is fairly well reproduced by our mod-
els Indeed the 15
g R factor in the adopted SFR creates
large abundance variations within short distances in small
galaxies On the other hand important gradients cannot
13 is relatively small Although this conclusion is an im-
mediate consequence of the observations in Fig 13 it has
only been noticed recently Prantzos and Boissier 2000
In Fig 14 we plot the oxygen abundance gradients in
dexkpc as a function of 1RB which is proportional to
a magnitude gradient in magkpc both from observa-
tions and from our models It can be seen that our models
show an excellent correlation between the abundance gra-
dients and 1RB smaller disks have larger gradients and
the results depend little on  In principle knowing the B-
band scalelength of a disk one should be able to determine
the corresponding abundance gradient and vice-versa In
practice however observations show a scatter around the
observed trend Since large disks cluster on the upper
left corner of the diagram we suggest that observations
of the abundance gradients in small disks would help to
establish the exact form of the correlation The success of
our models calibrated on the Milky Way in reproducing
the observations points to a homologuous evolution for
galactic disks as suggested by Garnett et al 1997 but
does not explain the origin of the gradients

Figure 14 Predictions of our models for the gradient of
metallicity in dexkpc vs 1RB and comparison to ob-
servations Our model results are parametrised by the cor-
responding values of the spin parameter  A clear corre-
lation is found between abundance gradient in dexkpc
and 1RB from Prantzos and Boissier 2000

fer little in g
In the middle panel of Fig 13 the oxygen gradients are
expressed in dexRB When expressed in this unit the ob-
served abundance gradients show no more any correlation
to MB as already noticed in Garnett et al 1997 More-
over a considerable dispersion is obtained for all MB val-
ues while the average gradient is -02 dexRB Since the
estimates of RB both in observations and in our models
may be aected by extinction we consider that the agree-
ment of our models with the data is quite satisfactory
Another diculty may stem from the fact that relatively
few disks can be t with perfect exponentials according
to Courteau and Rix 1999 this happens for only 20
of the disk galaxies
In the lower panel of Fig 13 abundance gradients are
expressed in dexR25 Again observations show no trend
with MB and a considerable dispersion Our results also
show no correlation with MB while the average model
value -08 dexR25 is in perfect agreement with obser-
vations This is most encouraging since R25 is less aected
by considerations on dust extinction or t to an exponen-
tial prole
If one combines the conclusions of the upper and mid-
dle panel of Fig 13 namely the facts that a abundance
gradients in dexkpc become more important and present
a larger dispersion in low luminosity disks and b abun-
dance gradients in dexRB are independent of disk lumi-
nosity then shehe immediately concludes that there must
be a one-to-one correlation between abundance gradients
and scalelength RB The correlation must be relatively
tight since the observed dispersion middle panel of Fig
