ABSTRACT
We present the mass-metallicity MZ and luminosity-metallicity LZ relations at z  08 from
 1350 galaxies in the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 DEEP2 survey We determine
stellar masses by tting the spectral energy distribution inferred from photometry with current stellar
population synthesis models This work raises the number of galaxies with metallicities at z 08
by more than an order of magnitude We investigate the evolution in the MZ and LZ relations in
comparison with local MZ and LZ relations determined in a consistent manner using  21 000 galaxies
in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey We show that high stellar mass galaxies M  10106M at z 08
have attained the chemical enrichment seen in the local universe while lower stellar mass galaxies
M  1092M at z 08 have lower metallicities logOH  015 dex than galaxies at the
same stellar mass in the local universe We nd that the LZ relation evolves in both metallicity and
B-band luminosity between z 08 and z  0 with the B-band luminosity evolving as a function of
stellar mass We emphasize that the B-band luminosity should not be used as a proxy for stellar mass
in chemical evolution studies of star-forming galaxies Our study shows that both the metallicity
evolution and the B-band luminosity evolution for emission-line galaxies between the epochs are a
function of stellar mass consistent with the cosmic downsizing scenario of galaxy evolution

1 INTRODUCTION
The heavy-element abundance in galaxies is a key
physical property for understanding galaxy evolution
Metals are formed in massive stars and are dispersed into
the interstellar medium ISM via mass-loss processes
Hence metallicity provides an important record of the
star formation history of a galaxy Galaxies and their
chemical abundances however do not evolve as closed
systems where metals are dispersed into the ISM as gas
is converted into stars Rather they are modulated by
inow of unenriched gas eg Kewley et al 2010 and
a complex feedback mechanism where supernovae and
stellar winds inuence the ISM by inducing outows of
gas into the intergalactic medium IGM and regulating
star formation through reheating Larson 1974 Larson

A simple closed-box model in which feedback is not
considered predicts a correlation between two fundamen-
tal parametersmass and metallicity van den Bergh
1962 Schmidt 1963 Searle  Sargent 1972 Erb et al
2006 The pioneering work of Lequeux et al 1979 rst
showed this correlation in local irregular galaxies Many
subsequent eorts have focused on the relation between
luminosity and metallicity Skillman et al 1989 Zarit-
sky et al 1994 Garnett et al 1997 Lamareille et al
2004 Salzer et al 2005 where luminosity is taken as
a proxy for mass because of the diculty in inferring
galaxy masses from observables Early attempts to ex-
tend this relation to intermediate redshifts found that
the luminosity-metallicity LZ relation at earlier epochs
was consistent with the local universe Kobulnicky et al
1999 Carollo  Lilly 2001 However many recent inves-
tigations have provided compelling evidence for evolution
of the LZ relation over cosmological times Kobulnicky

Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004 Maier et al 2004 Shap-
ley et al 2004 2005 Luminosities of galaxies evolve
along with their chemical abundances on cosmological
timescales and disentangling the contribution for each
has posed diculties in these studies
Evolution in the LZ relation implies an evolution in the
more fundamental mass-metallicity MZ relation De-
velopment of more sophisticated models for stellar pop-
ulation synthesis Bruzual  Charlot 2003 and gaseous
nebula Ferland 1996 Charlot  Longhetti 2001 al-
lowed Tremonti et al 2004 hereafter T04 to estab-
lish and quantify the local MZ relation for  53 000
star-forming galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey SDSS They found that metallicity increases lin-
early with stellar mass for galaxies having masses be-
tween 1085M and 10105M and attens out at higher
masses They attribute this depletion of metals in less
massive galaxies to ubiquitous galactic winds that strip
metals more eectively from galaxies with shallow poten-
tial wells dispersing them into the IGM Alternatively
it has been suggested that low mass systems have ongo-
ing star formation and have yet to convert much of their
gas into stars and therefore are less evolved less metal-
rich systems as compared to more massive galaxies which
have undergone rapid star formation Brooks et al 2007
de Rossi et al 2007 Mouchine et al 2008 Finally a
varying galaxy-integrated initial mass function has also
emerged as a possible explanation for the observed MZ
relation Koppen et al 2007
Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations Brooks et al
2007 Oppenheimer  Dave 2008 have predicted an evo-
lution in the MZ relation and recent observations at in-
termediate redshifts z  07 have provided strong ev-
idence for an evolution Using the Gemini Deep Deep
Survey Savaglio et al 2005 rst showed the MZ re-
lation beyond the local universe for galaxies at z 
04  10 Their relation intersects the local relation at
M  10104M but is  03 dex lower at M  1093M
implying a much steeper slope They conclude that the
slope of the MZ relation must become atter over time
Cowie  Barger 2008 found a dierence  02 dex for
a redshift range of 0475  z  09 with a similar slope
More recently Lamareille et al 2009 nd a atter slope
in the MZ relation out to z  09 and an average dier-
ence in metallicity of  02 dex To date the MZ rela-
tion has been extended beyond z 3 Shapley et al 2005
Erb et al 2006 Maiolino et al 2008 Perez-Montero et al
2009 Mannucci et al 2009 All these studies have shown
evidence of evolution but rigorous quantitative analysis
has been hampered by disparate results and small sample
sizes leaving the MZ relation at higher redshifts quanti-
tatively uncertain
In this paper we present results of our study determin-
ing the mass-metallicity and luminosity-metallicity rela-
tion for galaxies in the redshift range of 075  z  082
We infer metallicities from gas phase oxygen abundances
using strong line diagnostics Pagel et al 1979 Kewley
 Dopita 2002 Kewley  Ellison 2008 hereafter KE08
We make use of publicly available data from the Deep Ex-
tragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 DEEP2 Davis et al
2003 We measure the MZ and LZ relations from 1348
galaxies a substantial increase in the number of objects
studied in this redshift range to date We note that a
large sample of galaxies with metallicity and stellar mass
determinations in such small redshift range is ideal for re-
liably constraining the MZ relation at a specic redshift
In  2 we present our criteria for selection of galaxies and
properties of our selected sample In  3 we describe our
method for determining masses our correction for under-
lying Balmer absorption and our method for determining
masses In  4 we present our derived MZ and LZ rela-
tions In  5 we present a discussion of our results Here
we compare the MZ and LZ relation and infer the B-band
luminosity and evolution as a function of stellar mass
and we compare our MZ relation with relations derived
by other authors at similar redshts We summarize our
results in  6 Where necessary we adopt the standard

2 THE DATA
21 DEEP2 Survey Data
Our z  08 sample comes from the DEEP2 Deep Ex-
tragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 survey The DEEP2
team used the DEIMOS Faber et al 2003 multi-object
spectrograph on the Keck telescope to measure spectra
for galaxies in 4 elds covering 35 deg2 down to a lim-
iting magnitude of RAB  241 The survey contains
spectra for 50 000 galaxies the majority of which are
in the redshift range 07  z  14 The relatively high-
resolution R  5000 spectra cover the nominal spectral
range 6500-9100A For this study we used the third data
release1 data and the 1-d spectra were obtained from the
Horne extraction Horne 1986
BRI photometry was obtained by the DEEP2 team
for these objects from imaging carried out using the
1 httpwwwdeepberkeleyeduDR3
CFH12K camera on the 36 m Canada France Hawaii
Telescope Coil et al 2004 For a subsample of the
data Ks-band photometry was available in addition to
the BRI photometry These data were obtained using the
Wide Field Infrared Camera on the 5m Hale telescope at
Mt Palomar Bundy et al 2006 All magnitudes in this
study are in the AB system
22 Data Selection
From the 46337 unique objects in the survey we be-
gin by selecting 31656 galaxies for which we have secure
redshift determinations from the DEEP2 team Q  3
see website for more details For our determination of
metallicity we use the R23 strong line diagnostic rst
calibrated by Pagel et al 1979 We apply a more recent
R23 calibration based on the stellar population synthe-
sis and photoionization model calibrations from Kewley
 Dopita 2002 and updated in Kobulnicky  Kew-
ley 2004
In the text we refer to this calibration as
KK04 The R23 method is a parameterization of metal-
licity as function of the ratio of the oxygen nebular emis-
sion OII3727 doublet OIII4959 and OIII5007
to H The method is formally dened in  33 Given
the nominal spectral range of the DEEP2 survey we can
suciently bracket the required emission lines within the
075  z  082 redshift range Due to a varying ob-
ject position on the slitmask the actual spectral range
varies from object to object and we require that the spec-
tra cover the wavelength range of 3720  5020A leaving
us with 2738 galaxies We were unable to measure the
metallicity in 234 galaxies due to our inability to t the
oxygen or H emission lines leaving us with 2504 galax-
We calculate the R23 ratios using the continuum nor-
malized ux see Appendix for full description In the
appendix we show that the pseudo-EW is equal to within
the errors to the equivalent width and refer to it here-
after as the EW The errors on our equivalent width
and line ratio determination come from propagating the
measurement uncertainties in the spectrum In selecting
galaxies for analysis we require that the SN H  3
EW H  4A and the error in the R23 line ratio be
less than 2 At high metallicities the line strength of the
OII and OIII line diminishes due to the eectiveness
of line cooling of the HII region In order to avoid biasing
our MZ relation to lower metallicities we do not place a
SN cut on these lines We normalize the line ux to the
continuum by tting a polynomial to the underlying con-
tinuum and dividing the spectrum by this t We require
that the t to the continuum be 1c above zero where c
is the standard deviation of the line-subtracted spectrum
see appendix for more detail These cuts leave us with
1713 galaxies
Strong-line methods of metallicity determination as-
sume a star forming population of galaxies and are
not applicable to AGN We identify all galaxies with
logR23  1 as AGN and remove them from our sample
Kewley et al in prep Furthermore using the color
separation for blue and red galaxies parameterized by
Willmer et al 2006 for the DEEP2 survey Weiner et al
2007 conclude that a very small fraction of blue galaxies
have AGN whereas at least half of the red galaxies with
detectable emission lines show evidence of AGN emission

Similar to T04 we select the blue star forming galaxies
to analyze as described in the following section We re-
move the red galaxies from our sample and are left with
1631 blue emission line galaxies The rst and second
column of Table 1 summarizes our selection The median
for EW H SN H and R23 of our selected sample
is 121 100 and 065 respectively
23 Properties of Selected Sample
Willmer et al 2006 studied the red and blue galaxy
luminosity functions by dividing the DEEP2 sample at
the trough of the bimodal U  B color distribution The
U- and B-band absolute magnitudes are synthesized by
relating the observed magnitudes to spectral energy dis-
tributions SEDs of nearby galaxies and inferring a rest-
frame absolute magnitude from this SED We follow a
similar procedure and synthesize the U- and B-band ab-
solute magnitude using the lters of Buser 1978 and
Azusienis  Straizys 1969 respectively The red and
blue galaxy color division found by Willmer et al 2006
is given by
U  B  10  0032MB  215
The color division has been converted to AB magnitudes
using Table 1 from Willmer et al 2006
In column
three and four of Table 1 we examine the cuts from our
selection with respect to the galaxy color
The top left panel of Figure 1 shows the color-
magnitude diagram and the solid red line is the color
division given by equation 1 The other three panels
give the absolute B-band magnitude stellar mass de-
rived in  31 and U  B color distribution The black
histogram gives the full sample of 4198 DEEP2 galaxies
between 075  z  082 We refer to this sample as
the DEEP2 Full sample Using the U  B color division
we split the DEEP2 Full sample into sub-samples of red
and blue galaxies The histograms of these sub-samples
are plotted in red and blue and we refer to these sub-
samples as the DEEP2 Red and DEEP2 Blue samples
respectively The grey histogram is the distribution of
our selected sample of 1631 galaxies described in  22
and we refer to this as our DEEP2 Selected sample The
median properties of these samples are given in Table 2
The absolute B-band magnitude distribution in the
top right panel of Figure 1 shows a range of 190 
MB  23 for the DEEP2 Full sample Faber et al
2007 showed that luminosity functions derived for blue
galaxies from the DEEP2 data have a M 
B  2115
in our selected redshift range Our DEEP2 Selected
sample consists of galaxies around the knee of the blue
galaxy luminosity function Schechter 1976 with  15
2451631 of our galaxies brighter than M 
B The bot-
tom left panel of Figure 1 shows that the U  B color
range is 0  U  B  15 for the DEEP2 Full sample
The color division between red and blue is at U  B  1
and the bimodal distribution is clearly highlighted by
the well separated peaks in the blue and red histograms
The bimodal color distribution separates red early-type
galaxies from blue late-type star forming galaxies Strat-
eva et al 2001 Hogg et al 2003 Baldry et al 2004
Willmer et al 2006 The mass distribution shown in
the bottom right panel of Figure 1 reects this bimodal-
ity whereby the red galaxies in our sample are not only
brighter but more massive and separated from the lower
mass blue galaxies
By comparing the histograms and median properties in
Figure 1 it is clear that the DEEP2 Red sample of galax-
ies are brighter and more massive than the DEEP2 Blue
sample However when comparing the histograms and
median properties of our DEEP2 Selected sample which
is comprised solely of blue galaxies with the DEEP2 Blue
sample there is no selection bias towards the brighter or
more massive galaxies as one may expect given the se-
lection criteria We conclude from the comparison of
the properties of the DEEP2 Selected and DEEP2 Blue
sample that our selected galaxies are representative of

3 DATA ANALYSIS
31 Stellar Mass Determination
We estimate galaxy stellar masses by comparing pho-
tometry with stellar population synthesis models in or-
der to determine the mass-to-light ratio Bell et al 2003
Fontana et al 2004 We use the Le Phare2 code devel-
oped by Arnouts S  Ilbert O to estimate the galactic
stellar mass Le Phare is a set of FORTRAN routines de-
veloped to determine the photometric redshifts of galax-
ies If the redshift is known it can be held xed while

other physical parameters of the galaxy are determined
ie stellar mass by SED tting
The stellar templates of Bruzual  Charlot 2003 and
an IMF described by Chabrier 2003 are used to synthe-
size magnitudes The 27 models span three metallicities
and seven exponentially decreasing star formation mod-
els SFR  et  with   01 03 1 2 3 5 10 15 and
30 Gyrs We apply the extinction law of Calzetti et al
2000 allowing EB-V to range from 0 to 06 and stellar
population ages ranging from 0 to 13 Gyrs Ilbert et al
2009 provide a more detailed description of how the
physical parameters are estimated
We are able to determine stellar masses using BRI
and Ks-band data for 454 of our selected galaxies The
K-band survey of the DEEP2 elds covers 60 of the
area so K-band photometry is not available for all galax-

as compared with BRIKs-band photometry MBRIKs y-axis The right panel compares mass estimates made using Le Phare MLP 
x-axis and those provided by the MPAJHU team MSDSS y-axis The dashed line in each plot is the one-to-one correspondence of the
two data sets The solid line is a bisector t to the data The sub-panel in each of the plots shows a histogram of the dierences between
the two estimates with -004 and 019 dex added as corrections to the MBRI and MLP mass estimates respectively
ies in the survey Bundy et al 2006 In order to test
for systematic variation in the stellar mass determina-
tion for the remaining sample of galaxies with only BRI
photometry we compare the stellar masses for our 454
galaxies determined with BRI and Ks-band data with
stellarmasses determined for the same galaxies with just
the BRI bands The left panel of Figure 2 shows the
comparison The x-axis is the mass determination from
BRI band data and the y-axis is the mass determination
from BRIKs-band data The dashed line is the one-to-
one correspondence and the solid line is a linear bisector
t to the data
We perform a bootstrap linear t by taking the bisec-
tor of the X vs Y and Y vs X regression using the rou-
tine boot xytpro from the IDL astronomy users library
Bootstrapping is a non-parametric statistical method of
inferring errors whereby errors are calculated from the
distribution of the tted parameters for many ts to ran-
domly selected subsample of the data In order to mini-
mize the covariance between the slope and intercept we
zero point the data by subtracting 10 from the logarithm
of the stellar mass The linear t is given by
XBRIKs  0042  0006  100  001XBRI  2
where XBRI  MBRI  10 XBRIKs  MBRIKs  10 and
MBRI and MBRIKs are the stellar masses determined
by using three and four bands respectively The slope is
consistent with unity To rst order the absence of the
KS-band data results in only a  004 dex overestimate
of the stellar mass
The DEEP2 galaxies with Ks-band data from the full
sample are generally brighter and more massive than our
selected galaxies while the color distribution is consis-
tent with our selected sample The Ks-band data for our
selected sample span the full range of mass color and ab-
solute B-band magnitude and the medians are 981 068
and -207 respectively To check for any systematic vari-
ations with galaxy properties we t half of the data that
is below the median in mass color and magnitude re-
spectively and nd that the ts are all consistent within
the errors When Ks-band photometry is unavailable
we subtract 004 dex from the mass to correct for the
systematic overestimate After applying this correction
there is a 012 dex dispersion between the one-to-one cor-
respondence of the two mass estimates
We have redetermined the local MZ and LZ relations
from  21 000 galaxies in the SDSS data release 7 see
appendix We compared our stellar mass determination
using Le Phare with those determined by the MPAJHU
team from tting the photometry and a Kroupa IMF
Kroupa 2001 Both methods use stellar population syn-
thesis to t the photometry and we expect the estimates
to only vary by a constant oset The right panel of
Figure 2 shows this comparison The dashed line is the
one-to-one correspondence and the solid line is a boot-
strap linear bisector t to the data as described earlier
The linear t is given by
XLP  0198  0001  1035  0003XSDSS
where XLP  MLP  10 and XSDSS  MSDSS  10
MLP and MSDSS are the stellar masses determined using
Le Phare and those provided by the MPAJHU team
respectively As before to minimize the covariance of the
slope and intercept we zero point the data by subtracting
10 from the masses The slope is near unity and to rst
order the estimates dier by only a constant oset of
0198 dex a factor of  16 Taking into account this
constant oset there is a 014 dex dispersion in the one-
to-one correspondence between the two mass estimates
For local galaxies it has been shown that the errors
between photometric and dynamical mass are typically
 02 dex Drory et al 2004 In this study we observe
galaxies at z  08 and therefore expect even greater
errors in the photometric determination of mass More-
over Conroy et al 2009 have shown that additional un-
certainties in estimates of physical parameters from stel-
lar population synthesis modeling result from the choice
of IMF dust model and spectral libraries However the
full impact of these eects on the absolute calibration
of the physical parameters are still not well understood
Therefore when investigating evolution of the MZ rela-
tion we take care to have a consistent relative calibration
of the physical parameters between the samples The ab-
solute calibration remains uncertain
32 Correction for Stellar Balmer Aborption
When measuring EWs it is necessary to make a cor-
rection for underlying stellar absorption in the Balmer
lines Kobulnicky  Phillips 2003 have estimated an
average correction of 2A in the EW H for the under-
lying Balmer absorption using 22 galaxies from the spec-
troscopic galaxy atlas of Kennicutt 1992 The galaxies
in the Kennicutt atlas have a spectral resolutions of 5-8A
We expect the eects of Balmer absorption to be greater
in galaxy spectra with lower resolution because the ux of
the narrow emission line is spread over a broader region
of the absorption trough Presumably for this reason
Cowie  Barger 2008 nd a correction of 1A by stack-
ing spectra observed using DEIMOS onboard Keck with
a spectral resolution of 35A The DEEP2 data have also
been obtained using DEIMOS but with a smaller spectral
resolution of 14A
Unfortunately the low SN in our data does not al-
low us to investigate the Balmer absorption in individ-
ual galaxy spectra However the strength of the Balmer
absorption is a function of the age of the stellar popula-
tion and is therefore expected to correlate with physical
parameters of the galaxy such as stellar mass
der to investigate the eects of stellar absorption on our
measurement we stack our spectra in bins of stellar mass
and examine the eect of the Balmer absorption on the
EW H
We stack our spectra into 7 mass bins We normal-
ize each spectrum to the continuum by dividing by the
median value of the continuum between 4800  4815A
and 4900  4915A We then stack  230 spectra in each
mass bin by interpolating all spectra to have the same
wavelength vector and take the median of the ux cor-
responding to each wavelength element We get similar
results if we take the mean rather than the median The
left panel of Figure 3 shows an example of a stacked
spectrum We see that the H emission line sits on a
broad absorption trough The EW H correction ac-
counts for the integrated ux of the emission line red
curve that lies below the continuum blue curve and
would not be included when measuring the EW H in
lower SN spectra due to the absorption green curve
To obtain a correction we measure the EW H for the
stacked spectrum and a corrected spectrum with the ab-
sorption removed The right panel shows the correction
to the EW H as a function of stellar mass The red
line is a linear least-square t given by
EWcorr  101  005  038  008x
where x  logM  10 EWcorr is the amount added
to the EW H to correct for underlying absorption
We emphasize that the correction given by equation 4
is sensitive to the tting procedure A dierent method
using a smaller continuum window for example may
yield a dierent correction The median correction to
the EW H in our sample is 09 We note that this
correction does not signicantly eect our derived MZ
relation owing to the fact that the median correction of
09 A is small compared to the median EW H of 121
A This small correction translates to a median increase
of 004 dex in metallicity
We perform a simple test in order to assess the eect
of varying the spectral resolution on the Balmer absorp-
tion correction We convolve our stacked spectra with
gaussians of varying widths We nd that the Balmer
correction is sensitive to the spectral resolution The
correction increases with smaller spectral resolution and
the slope of the correction with respect to stellar mass
attens We speculate that the larger correction found
by Kobulnicky  Phillips 2003 may be attributed to
the lower spectral resolution of their data In a future
study using higher quality data we hope to quantita-
tively establish the magnitude of this eect
33 Metallicity Determination
We use the strong line diagnostics of KK04 as pre-
sented in KE08 in order to obtain an estimate of galaxy
gas-phase metallicities The diagnostics are based on the
Kewley  Dopita 2002 R23 theoretical calibrations In
both diagnostics the metallicity is determined using the
R23 and O32 ratios We calculate these ratios from our
EWs such that
EW OII  EW OIII
EW H
EW OIII
EW OII
where EW OII
OII doublet and
EW OIII is taken to be 133EW OIII5007 We
have used the assumption that the ratio of the uxes of
OIII5007 to OIII4959 is 3 Osterbrock 1989 We
have tted the OIII4959 line because the widths of
the H OIII4959 and OIII5007 line ts are tied
in order to increase the SN of the t as described in
the appendix but the SN in the EW OIII5007 is
higher and the EW OIII4959 is inferred from theo-
retical considerations for the metallicity determination
We use equations A4 and A6 given in the appendix of
KE08 to derive the ionization parameter and metallicity
respectively The R23 method for determining metallic-
ities is known to be sensitive to the ionization parame-
ter The ionization parameter characterizes the ioniza-
tion state of the gas and quantitatively represents the
number of ionizing photons per second per unit area di-
vided by the hydrogen density The ionization param-
eter has the units of velocity and can be thought of as
the maximum velocity of the ionization front through
the nebula The metallicity and ionization parameter
are interdependent In order to obtain a consistent mea-
surement of the metallicity and ionization parameter an
iterative scheme is used the details of which are provided
in the appendix of KE08 Furthermore all metallicities
used in this study for comparison that are not explicitly
Fig 3 The left panel shows an example of a stacked spectra The red curve is a t to the H emission the green curve is a t to the
H absorption and the blue line is a t to the continuum The are of the region bracketed by the absorption on the bottom emission on
the sides and continuum at the top is the correction factor to the EW H The right panel shows this correction for H absorption as a
function of stellar mass for data sorted into 7 mass bins The red line is a linear parameterization of the correction as a function of stellar
12  logOH  84 This degeneracy is due to the
fact that on the lower branch R23 scales with metallicity
because the intensity of the collisionally excited OII and
OIII lines scales with the abundance On the upper
branch nebular cooling which results from collisional
excitation followed by photon emission eectively cools
the nebula decreasing the electron temperature leading
to a decrease in the rate of collisional excitation of the
OII and OIII lines In order to break this degeneracy
generally other line ratios such as NIIH are used
However in our sample these lines are not observed and
the metallicity is assumed to lie on the upper branch
This assumption breaks down at lower masses Looking
at the R23 mass relation in Figure 4 a turnover appears
to occur at about logM  92 and we revisit this issue

4 MASS-METALLICITY AND LUMINOSITY-METALLICITY
RELATIONS
From our measured EWs and photometry we can esti-
mate both the gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar
masses for the galaxies in our sample From the Spear-
man rank test we conclude with over 99 condence
that we have a positive correlation between mass and
metallicity and luminosity and metallicity This con-
dence in our observed correlation justies a t to the

The top panel of Figure 5 shows stellar mass and metal-
licity measured for our sample of 1631 galaxies The

In determining the metallicity we have assumed
that all galaxies fall on the upper branch of the KK04
metallicity diagnostic T04 have shown that in the local
universe the MZ relation extends down to a stellar mass
of M  1085M with no break in the slope We work
under the assumption that the MZ relation at z  08

tion of stellar mass The grey pluses are the unbinned data and
the black lled circles are the data binned into 15 mass bins where
each bin has equal number of data points

be consistent using the conversions provided in KE08
Figure 4 shows the R23 top and O32 bottom line
ratios for our sample The grey pluses are the individual
measurements and the black lled circles are the data
sorted into 15 mass bins of equal number of data points
The median values of the R23 and O32 line ratios are
51 and 06 and median errors are 06 and 006 respec-
tively Both the R23 and O32 line ratios are sensitive to
the metallicity and the relation between stellar mass and
the line ratios can be attributed to the relation between
stellar mass and metallicity
Metallicity is not a monotonic function of R23 but
rather is doubly valued for a given ratio A particular
value of R23 corresponds to two dierent metallicities
one on the higher metallicity branch and one on the lower
metallicity branch The peak of the R23 ratio occurs at
Fig 5 The mass and metallicity for the DEEP2 sample The
top panel shows the metallicity plotted against mass for the 1631
galaxies in our sample The bottom panel is a boxcar averaged
smoothing of the data displayed in the top panel binned by mass
We attribute the break in the slope at M  1092M to the mis-
placement of galaxies on the upper branch of the KK04 metallicity
diagnostic The vertical dashed line M  1092M in the lower
panel is our lower limit cuto mass used in determining the MZ
relation for the DEEP2 sample
extends to at least M  109M with no break in slope
Under this assumption we interpret the break in the
slope at M  1092M observed in the bottom panel
of Figure 5 to be caused by the misplacement of lower
branch galaxies on the upper branch This turnover mass
is further evidenced by the the R23 ratio as a function of
stellar mass seen Figure 4 We take a lower mass limit
indicated by the vertical dashed line in the bottom panel
of Figure 5 of M  1092M to t our MZ relation We
note that 283 of our 1631 galaxies fall below this limit
leaving us with 1348 galaxies from which we determine
the MZ relation
We parameterize the MZ relation with a quadratic
function of the form
12  logOH  A  Bx  Cx2
where x  logM  10 Our data and t residuals are
not normally distributed so we apply a standard non-
parametric bootstrapping technique in determining the
t parameters and errors One of the underlying assump-
tions of the bootstrapping method is that the observed
distribution reasonably approximates the parent distri-
bution Under this assumption and the assumption of
independence of the sample properties determined from
many independent random subsamples of the data should
be normally distributed We begin by randomly select-
ing with replacement 1348 galaxies from our sample
of 1348 galaxies Meaning within a random subsample
some data points may be selected more than once while
others may not be selected at all We then bin these ran-
domly selected galaxies by sorting them into 15 equally
populated mass bins The mass and metallicity in each
bin is determined by taking the median of the data in
the bin We perform a least-square quadratic t to the
binned data using the routine poly tpro in IDL We ran-
domly resample and t the data 10000 times and take
the mean and standard deviation of this distribution of
tted parameters which are normally distributed as the
t parameters and errors for the MZ relation
The MZ relation is best tted by
12  logOH  8923  024 x  006 x2
with the 1 errors in each of the parameters in equation
8 given by A  0007 B  001 and C  003 Figure
6 shows the DEEP2 MZ relation at z  08 compared
to the local MZ relation from SDSS see appendix The
black lled circles are the data sorted into 15 mass bins
Each bin contains  90 data points and the errors on the
data are determined by randomly selecting  90 data
points in each bin and taking the median of the subsam-
ple We take the standard deviation of this distribution
as the error in each bin We note that this scatter charac-
terizes the distribution of metallicities within each mass
bin and therefore accounts for both measurement uncer-
tainties and intrinsic scatter in the metallicity determi-
nation The grey lines are the 16 and 84 percentile
contours of the data The large dispersion at the high
mass end is due to the large interval in mass covered by
the highest mass bins
Overall we nd that the high-mass M  10105M
DEEP2 galaxies have similar metallicities within the er-
rors of 005 dex to local galaxies at the same stellar
mass At lower masses M  10105M the DEEP2
galaxies have lower metallicities than the SDSS sample
for a given stellar mass up to a logOH  015 dex

ized by the equation

However the local LZ relation appears to turn over at

part of the local LZ relation with MB  20 The slope
of this t and the DEEP2 LZ relation are consistent to
within the errors KK04 nd that the slope of the LZ
relation for z  06  08 and z  08  10 are 0117
0017 and 0134  0032 respectively To within the
errors the slopes derived by KK04 agree with DEEP2
and local LZ relation slopes as well
5 DISCUSSION
Fig 6 The MZ relation derived from the DEEP2 sample The black data points are the median of the mass and metallicity sorted into
15 bins The bootstrapped errors are determined by randomly selecting galaxies from within each mass bin and determining the median
for this subsample The error bar then is the standard deviation of the distribution of median values The grey lines are the 16 and 84
contours of the data The solid curve is a quadratic t to the data and the dotted curves around the quadratic t are the 1 uncertainty
in the t determined from bootstrapping the errors The dashed curve is the local MZ relation from the appendix of this paper

tion of stellar mass in the population of blue galaxies

tion with other authors  53
51 Assumptions
We list and address some key assumptions made in this
1 All galaxies with M  1092M are on the upper
branch of the R23 diagnostic At the lower mass end of
the DEEP2 MZ relation the dispersion is small and con-
sistent with the dispersion found in the local MZ relation
T04 This small dispersion suggests that at z  08
the vast majority of galaxies with M  1092M are on
the upper metallicity branch of the R23 diagnostic Ad-
ditionally T04 have observed a continuous slope down to
M  1085M A breakdown of this assumption would
result in the R23 measure of metallicity in low metallic-
ity galaxies to be signicantly overestimated  1dex re-
sulting in a attening of the MZ relation at lower masses
This attening is observed to occur at M  1092M
and given the small dispersion we hypothesize that mis-
placement on the upper branch is minor above this mass
Near infrared spectroscopy to obtain additional line ra-
tios for a representative subsample of DEEP2 galaxies is
needed to test this hypothesis
2 Metals are instantaneously recycled This approx-
imation was rst introduced by Schmidt 1963 The
approximation is valid when metals produced in massive
stars such as oxygen are considered and if the SFR is not
subject to extreme variations on short timescale Pagel
1997 From their study of DEEP2 galaxies since z  11
Noeske et al 2007b determine that the dominant form
of evolution is a gradual decline in star formation
3 We have attempted to remove AGN using empirical
limits on the R23 ratio and the color bimodality This re-
moves most of the galaxies whose emission is dominated
by AGN but composite galaxies in our sample may be
blue and not exceed the empirical R23 limit AGN con-
tamination in composite galaxy spectra increases the R23
ratio due to the high OIIIH ratio On the upper
metallicity branch of the R23 diagnostic the metallicity
is a monotonically decreasing function of R23 There-
fore AGN contamination will lower the metallicity esti-
mate However due to their relatively small numbers in
the DEEP2 blue galaxy sample Weiner et al 2007 and

the small dispersion in the MZ relation AGN contami-
nation is likely to play a minor role in the MZ relation
Lamareille et al 2009 Near infrared spectroscopy to
obtain additional AGN-sensitive emission-line ratios is
required to verify this assumption
4 Since its introduction by Salpeter 1955 the initial
stellar mass function IMF - describing the mass distri-
bution of stars at birth - has largely been taken to be
universal and invariant Indirect evidences for variations
in the local IMF have been provided by the comparison
of H emission to the far-ultraviolet ux Meurer et al
2009 and the H ux to broadband color index Hover-
sten  Glazebrook 2008 Comparisons of the rate of lu-
minosity evolution to that of color evolution provides in-
direct observational evidence for a possible redshift evo-
lution in the IMF van Dokkum 2008 Furthermore
IMF variations have been cited as the possible cause of
the MZ relation Koppen et al 2007 We work under
the assumption that the IMF is universal
5 MZ and LZ relation studies assume that the ab-
sence of low surface brightness galaxies LSBGs do not
signicantly bias the determination of the MZ and LZ re-
lations Impey  Bothun 1997 point out that LSBGs
will be absent in magnitude limited surveys However by
comparing photometry in overlapping elds where both
CFHT and Hubble Space Telescope imaging is avail-
able no galaxies brighter than the magnitude limit of
RAB  241 are found to be lost due to low surface
brightness Simard et al 2002 Willmer et al 2006 Mel-
bourne et al 2007 come to similar conclusions regard-
ing the loss of low surface brightness galaxies from deep
imaging in the GOODS-N eld
52 B-band Luminosity Evolution
In many previous studies luminosity has been taken
as a proxy for mass Kobulnicky  Koo 2000 Pettini
et al 2001 Garnett 2002 Kobulnicky et al 2003 Kob-
ulnicky  Kewley 2004 Maier et al 2004 Shapley et al
2004 2005 However it has been recognized that the
evolution in the LZ relation cannot straightforwardly be
attributed to metallicity evolution but that luminosity
evolution must also be considered By comparing gures
6 and 7 we see that the oset in metallicity in the MZ
relation is signicantly smaller than the oset in the LZ
relation Lamareille et al 2009 among others suggest
that the dierential evolution in the LZ and MZ relation
results from an evolution in the mass-to-light ratio They

2008 labeled C08 The diamonds are the median instead of the
mean of the data from Cowie  Barger 2008 Metallicities and
masses have been converted to be consistent amongst the samples
The relations only cover the stellar mass range over which they
were determined
evolution in the B-band Tully-Fisher relation has also
been observed since z  1 and is consistent with the ob-
served luminosity evolution Weiner et al 2006 Noeske
et al 2007b show that the star formation as a whole
was higher at z  1 and that the star formation rate
gradually declines with galaxies spending 67 of their
lifetime since z  1 with SFR that are within a factor
2 of their average and 95 of their time within a factor
of 4 In an accompanying letter Noeske et al 2007a
nd that initial onset and rate of decline in star forma-
tion are functions of redshift and galaxy mass with less
massive galaxies having later initial onsets with a lower
rate of decline and consider this an important component
of downsizing Cowie et al 1996 The absolute B-band
luminosity is a tracer of star formation and the observed
dierential evolution with respect to stellar mass shown
in Figure 8 may be attributed to this type of downsizing
53 Comparison of MZ Relations
There are considerable diculties in making a compar-
ison of the MZ relation owing to the varying quality and
type of data and the dierent methodologies and sample
selections The systematic dierences among strong-line
metallicity calibrations have been investigated by KE08
They derived conversions that reach agreement among
calibrations to within 005 dex in metallicity KE08
conclude that while absolute metallicity values are uncer-
tain relative metallicities such as MZ relations can be
reliably compared providing that the metallicities have
been converted into the same base calibration
Though osets between dierent metallicity calibra-
tions can now be removed the systematic eects on dif-
fering measurements of stellar mass have yet to be fully
explored Moreover comparisons between spectral and
photometric methods have not been rigorously investi-
Fig 8 The B-band luminosity evolution inferred from the
comparison of our MZ and LZ relations The black data points are
determined by taking the dierence between the binned DEEP2
data and the t to the local MZ relation and plugging it into equa-
tion 10 The line is from combining equations 10 and 11

MB  a1  logOHM  logOHL
where a is the slope of the LZ relation and logOHM
and logOHL are the dierences in metallicity at a
xed stellar mass and xed B-band magnitude in the
MZ and LZ relations respectively Equation 10 assumes
that the metallicity evolution is characterized by the MZ
relation and that additional evolution inferred from the
LZ relation is due to evolution of the luminosity
We estimate the evolution of the B-band luminosity
as a function of stellar mass from equation 10 We take
the dierence between the local and DEEP2 LZ relation
logOHL to be the average dierence between the
binned DEEP2 data and the t to the local LZ rela-
tion over all magnitudes see Figure 7 Consequently
logOHL  020  003 dex and a  011 We take
logOHM to be the dierence between the DEEP2
binned data and local MZ relation t The dierence is
parameterized by
logOHM  012  001  008  002x
where x  logM  10 Here we have performed a
linear least-squares t using poly tpro and the errors
are determined from the residuals of the t and do not
account for observational uncertainties
Figure 8 shows the B-band luminosity evolution in-
ferred from our comparison of the DEEP2 MZ and LZ
relations Combining equation 10 and 11 we get
MB  068  006  07  01x
the B-band luminosity evolution of blue star forming
galaxies between z  08 and the local galaxy population
as a function of stellar mass This is shown in Figure 8
by the solid line
It has been shown that the luminosity functions of
blue galaxies evolve with time Ilbert et al 2005 Blan-
ton 2006 Willmer et al 2006 Faber et al 2007 These
studies conclude that M 
B has dimmed by  1 mag since
z  08 consistent with the evolution observed in our
sample at the higher stellar mass end A dierential
gated and the systematic eects of the photometric bands
used in determining stellar mass remain uncertain These
problems are further compounded by the fact that many
of the selection criteria in these studies may be a func-
tion of redshift ie SN of ux or EW minimum values
of ux or EW color etc and therefore the samples
from which the MZ relations are determined may not be
comparable even if similar selections are used
Several authors have investigated the MZ relation cov-
ering the redshift interval examined in this study z 
075  082 Figure 9 compares our MZ relation solid
curve with previously derived relations from Savaglio
et al 2005 dot-dashed Cowie  Barger 2008 triple
dot-dashed and Lamareille et al 2009 long dashed
line All metallicities have been converted to the KK04
calibration using the conversions in KE08 We have at-
tempted to make the stellar masses consistent with ours
by converting all the determinations to the Chabrier IMF
used in this study The relations plotted only cover the
stellar mass range over which they were determined
The rst attempt to investigate the MZ relation at in-
termediate redshifts was made by Savaglio et al 2005
using the Gemini Deep Deep Survey This sample con-
sists of 28 galaxies from the Gemini Deep Deep Survey
with emission in OII H and OIII at the 3 level cov-
ering the redshift range of z  040  098 This sample
consists of galaxies designated as late 728 and inter-
mediate type 2128 This sample is augmented with 28
galaxies from the Canada France Redshift Survey Lilly
et al 1995The dot-dashed t in Figure 9 is a linear
bisector t of the S05 mass and metallicity Though
Savaglio et al establish a MZ relation at higher red-
shifts the small sample size and selection in addition to
the tting method does not allow us to make a direct
comparison with our determination
Lamareille et al 2009 study the evolution of the
MZ relation by splitting their sample into three redshift
ranges They nd that the most massive galaxies un-
dergo the most evolution at z  08 implying that the
slope of the MZ relation attens out at higher redshts
However L09 do not nd a strong Spearman rank cor-
relation coecient thus hindering a rigorous statistical
analysis The relation shown in Figure 9 long-dashed
line is a linear t to average metallicities in 4 mass bins
for  130 galaxies in the redshift range of z  06  08
The galaxies are selected to have SN  4 in the ux
of the OII H and OIII emission lines The atten-
ing of the slope at higher redshifts may possibly be a
consequence of the SN cut on the OII and OIII lines
These cuts may be a function of redshift and bias against
higher metallicity galaxies generally found at higher stel-
lar masses At lower masses the MZ relation of L09 is
in agreement with our determination
Cowie  Barger 2008 hereafter C08 study the evo-
lution of the MZ relation by splitting their sample into a
low-z and mid-z redshift interval The two intervals are
005  z  0475 and 0475  z  09 and have a median
redshift of 044 and 075 respectively The low-z and mid-
z samples have 35 and 154 galaxies respectively They
nd that there is a 025 dex dierence in the metallicity
in the mid-z sample as compared with the local relation
and that the metallicity increases by 013 dex between
the mid-z and low-z sample The triple dot-dashed line
in Figure 9 shows the mid-z relation
A major source of discrepancy between our determi-
nation and C08 can be attributed to the tting pro-
cedure Figure 31 of C08 shows that the spread in
metallicity becomes larger as metallicity decreases This
may result from the greater uncertainty in determining
metallicity from the R23 diagnostic which becomes less
sensitive to metallicity around the R23 local maximum
12  logOH  84 see C08 gure 23 or KK04 gure
7 for example The relation is curved so symmetric er-
rors in R23 become asymmetric errors in metallicity In
a least-square t the data are assumed to be normally
distributed however in this case they are not and out-
liers exert greater inuence in determining the best t
Looking at gure 63 of C08 shows that the median of the
metallicity in 4 mass bins is systematically higher than
the tted relation With the diamonds in gure 9 we
plot the median of the MZ relation for the mid-z sample
sorted into 3 mass bins L Cowie private communica-
tion We t our relation to the median metallicity in
15 mass bins as described in  4 The MZ relation deter-
mined from the median of the C08 data is more compara-
ble to our determination Given the many uncertainties
discussed in comparing the MZ relation the agreement
between the relation of L09 C08 and our determination
from DEEP2 is promising
Our MZ relation comparisons highlight the need for
consistent sample selection and MZ relation tting tech-
niques when comparing MZ relations at the same or dif-
ferent redshifts
6 SUMMARY
We have conducted a study of the mass-metallicity
and luminosity-metallicity relation at z  08 using the
1348 galaxies from the DEEP2 survey This large sam-
ple has allowed us to establish the mass-metallicity and
luminosity-metallicity relation at z  08 with greater
statistical signicance than previous studies in this red-
shift regime Such a large sample within a small red-
shift range is essential for avoiding evolution eects in
luminosity or metallicity that may inuence luminosity-
metallicity and mass-metallicity relations derived over a
larger redshift interval
We have obtained stellar masses by inferring a SED
from our photometry and tting it with current stellar
population synthesis models We have determined the
gas-phase oxygen abundance in a consistent manner from
strong-line methods We summarize our main results as
follows
1 We nd a clear correlation between mass and metal-
licity at z  08 consistent with previous work Savaglio
et al 2005 Cowie  Barger 2008 Lamareille et al 2009
The level of chemical enrichment achieved by galaxies is
a function of stellar mass At z  08 galaxies with
M  10106M have metallicities that are lower by 005
dex as compared to the local sample which is within
the errors of the metallicity calibration conversions The
metallicity dierence between z  08 and local galaxies
rises to 015 dex at M  1092M
2 There is a clear correlation between luminosity and
metallicity at z  08 as shown in previous work The
level of chemical enrichment achieved by galaxies is a
function of luminosity The metallicity at a given lumi-
nosity at z  08 is 020 dex lower than the local sample
due to the combination of metallicity and luminosity evo-
lution with redshift
3 The oset in the LZ relation between z  08 and lo-
cal galaxies is signicantly larger than the oset observed
in the MZ relation between these two redshifts We at-
tribute this dierence to evolution in the mass-to-light
ratio between z  08 and z  0 We infer a luminosity
evolution that scales with stellar mass and is consistent
with determinations from studies of blue galaxy luminos-
ity functions
Both the luminosity and metallicity evolution are a
function of stellar mass consistent with the downsizing
scenario of galaxy evolution In a subsequent paper we
will examine the origin of the mass-metallicity relation
and its evolution over cosmological timescales

APPENDIX
Line tting and line ratio determination
Conventionally when spectra are not ux calibrated as is the case in most spectroscopic redshift surveys equivalent
widths are utilized in determining the emission line ratios used for inferring metallicity Kobulnicky  Phillips 2003
hereafter KP03 The essential feature of equivalent widths is the normalization of the line emission to the underlying
continuum Here we will discuss the algorithm developed to determine line ratios in a self-consistant manner
We dene F x as the ux vector of our spectra with x being the rest-frame wavelength vector corresponding to
each resolution element We mask out 5v of our rest-frame line center wavelengths from NIST3 and t a global
continuum Here we take v to be a velocity dispersion of 150 kms We model the global continuum as
ciTix 
where Tix are model stellar spectra obtained from Bruzual  Charlot 2003 We perform a bounded value non-linear
least square t using the MPFIT4 set of routines Markwardt 2009 in IDL to obtain ci and pj with the constraint
that ci  0  We obtain a continuum-normalized ux such that
Cx  1
N x 
and t a three parameter gaussian AN e
to all emission lines AN  xN and N are the gain line center and
sigma of the gaussian and are used as initial estimates for ts to the local ux In all our ts to the DEEP2 data we
derive the errors on our parameters by propagating the measurement uncertainties in the spectrum

t continuum between 4775  4815A and 4905  4945A It should be noted that  in equation 4 does not have a
summation index If n  1 then the multiple gaussians simultaneously tted will have dierent aL and xoL but the
same L The parameters of the gaussian are constrained such that aL  0 xoL can only vary by 2A from the line
centers obtained from NIST5 and 0  L  10A For the OII 3726 3728 doublet n2 and for all other lines n1
This enables us to t the local continuum px to all lines separately except in the case of the OII doublet where
we t the continuum to both lines simultaneously
We obtain a continuum-normalized local ux Rx such that
px  1
We ret a model gRx of the form given in equation 4 with n3 for the H and OIII 4959 5007 lines and n2
for the OII 3726 3728 doublet These values of n for the two sets of lines ensures that the tted  will be the
same for all lines in the set We obtain a pseudo-EW for each line EWp such that EWp  aRR2 where aR and
R are parameters from the t of gRx to Rx
It becomes problematic to measure an equivalent width or pseudo-EW when the SN is low in the underlying
continuum In this situation the continuum is poorly measured and therefore a normalization to the continuum is
prone to large errors Before normalizing the local ux Lx to the continuum px we estimate the noise of the
local continuum c by taking the rms of C x where C x  Lx rx We require that px in the region of the
line xo  3L  x  xo  3L be 1c above zero If this condition is not met we do not normalize to the continuum
but instead t a function of the form given in equation 4 to Dx where Dx  Lx  px We then calculate a
pseudo-EW from the parameters of the t In this study a small fraction  1 of our galaxies have such low SN in
the continuum and are excluded from the study
Comparison of line ratio determination
In order to test the robustness of our tting method we compare our pseudo-EW and line ratios with published
equivalent widths and line ratios determined from calibrated uxes from the Nearby Field Galaxies Survey NFGS
Jansen et al 2000 KP03 compare how well interactively determined equivalent width ratios correspond to those
determined from measured uxes We deredden the uxes from NFGS sample as described in KP03 and use their
results as a benchmark for comparison Of the 198 galaxies in the survey 118 have published uxes Of those 118
104 galaxies have a SN of at least 8 for OII  3726 3728 OIII  4959 5007 and H emission lines We remove
two additional galaxies that have a good t determined visually but poor agreement with ratios determined from
5 This is done to account for possible errors in the redshift determination reported line centers from NIST andor wavelength calibrations
Fig 11 Comparison of tted emission line pseudo-EW ratios denoted EW y axis to dereddened emission line ux ratios denoted
F x axis for 102 galaxies from the Nearby Field Galaxies Survey Jansen et al 2000 From top left panel going clockwise we show
the OIIH OIIIH R23 and O32 ratios respectively The solid line in each panel shows the one-to-one agreement between the two
methods
calibrated uxes presumably due to the underlying continuum which is poorly measured leaving us with a sample of
102 galaxies plotted in gures 10 and 11
Figure 10 shows a direct comparison between the equivalent widths determined by Jansen et al 2000 and the
pseudo-EW determined by our automated method The rms dispersion from one-to-one agreement is 06 40 and 07A
with the mean value of the equivalent width being 75 280 and 153A for H OII and OIII respectively
In order to justify the fact that the pseudo-EW can be used in inferring gas-phase metallicities we need to establish
agreement between the calibrated ux ratios and our pseudo-EW ratios Figure 11 shows agreement in line ratios
determined with our method as compared to those from calibrated uxes with a rms dispersion from one-to-one
agreement of 010 006 011 and 008 dex for the OIIH OIIIH O32 and R23 ratios respectively Table 3 gives
the rms deviation from one-to-one agreement between line ratios determined using the two dierent methods The top
row shows the rms deviation from KP03 and the bottom row shows the rms deviation for our automated method for our
sample of 102 galaxies The median absolute deviation between the equivalent width and ux calibrated metallicities
is  001 dex In this local sample the errors from the statistical measurement uncertainties are about one half of those
introduced by using equivalent widths or our pseudo-EW in line ratio determinations Because galaxies are fainter
at higher redshift we expect them to have larger measurement uncertainties thereby making the errors from using
equivalent widths comparable or even less than the statistical measurement uncertainties
The O32 and R23 ratios are of particular importance because of their use in inferring metallicities Figure 11 and
Table 3 demonstrate that our method for determining line ratios are comparable to those that use ux calibrated ratios
Figure 12 shows a typical spectrum and t used in this study from the DEEP2 survey Our automated method has
several advantages over interactive determination of equivalent widths 1 The method is automated so considerably
faster than interactively determining equivalent widths and much more practical when working with large samples 2
The automated method yields results that are reproducible because it no longer requires the input of wavelength limits
in determining equivalent widths 3 The measurement errors in ux when available can be propagated through to
the determination of metallicity and therefore provide a much more robust estimate of the true errors in 12  logOH
4 In data where a low SN makes it dicult to distinguish between the line and the continuum the automatic t is
less susceptible to confusion 5 Low SN spectra where the continuum is not detected equivalent widths cannot be
determined These cases are handled in a much more robust manner allowing us to measure a pseudo-EW even when
equivalent widths cannot be measured

Redetermined Local MZ and LZ Relations from SDSS
The local MZ relation has been determined from the SDSS data by both T04 and KE08 T04 derive a galaxy
averaged gas-phase metallicity by simultaneously tting the most prominent emission lines with stellar population
synthesis and photoionization models KE08 determine the metallicity using several common strong line diagnostics
and calibrations and provide conversions between the various methods Additionally they investigate the eects of
various AGN classication scheme and aperture covering fraction The two determinations dier by as much as 03
dex when compared directly due mainly to the dierence in methodology of determining metallicities Converting to
the same metallicity diagnostic using Table 3 from KE08 the dierence decreases to  005 dex
The dierent MZ relations found in the literature at various redshifts may not necessarily be directly comparable
The dierences resulting from the various metallicity diagnostics and calibrations have ostensibly been resolved by
It should be noted however that it still remains uncertain whether relations calibrated using local galaxy
samples are valid at higher redshifts Care must be taken when comparing samples as selections eects lead to non-
trivial dierences in the determination of the MZ relation We attempt to manage some of the dierences arising
from selection bias and dierent diagnostics by redetermining the local MZ relation from the SDSS data release 7
Abazajian et al 2009 httpwwwmpa-garchingmpgdeSDSSDR7 using similar selection cuts and the same
metallicity calibration as our DEEP2 dataset
The SDSS DR7 consists of  818 000 galaxies spanning 0  z  07 The emission line equivalent widths and galaxy
stellar masses are calculated by the MPAJHU group and are publicly available on the SDSS DR7 website The
equivalent widths have been corrected for stellar absorption The ugriz ber and C model magnitudes recommended
for galaxy photometry are also provided We determine the stellar masses by tting the photometry to population
synthesis models using the Le Phare code see  31
We select galaxies by constraining the redshift such that 004  z  01 The lower limit is imposed to minimize
aperture eects Furthermore we follow the method of KE08 whereby we determine the g-band ber covering fraction
by comparing the ber and model magnitudes KE08 determine that a 20 covering fraction is insucient to avoid
aperture bias We require a larger aperture ber covering fraction of  30 in order to further reduce aperture eects
For the selected sample the median covering fraction is 38 The upper redshift limit is imposed in order to minimize
evolutionary eects and because the star-forming sample is found to be incomplete at higher redshifts Kewley et al
In order to minimize selection biases when comparing we impose a similar selection criteria as applied to the DEEP2
sample We require that SN H  3 r23  2 and EW H  4A The SDSS data have much broader spectral
coverage For all galaxies in our redshift range we use the star-forming galaxies dened by the Kewley et al 2006
classication scheme KE08 showed that MZ relation derived from the SDSS data using the logN IIOII ratio is
insensitive to the classication scheme used to identify and remove AGN The selected SDSS data sample consists of
 21 000 galaxies The median EW H and SN H of our selected sample is 89 and 207 respectively
Figure 13 shows the local MZ and LZ relations derived from the selected SDSS sample The metallicities have
been derived using the equivalent widths as described in  33 We place galaxies on the lower R23 branch when
logN IIOII  12 KE08 An insignicant fraction 2521816 are on the lower branch The ts to the
relations use the same bootstrapping method described in section 4 For the MZ relation the data are binned in 30
equally populated mass bins From the left panel of Figure 13 it can be seen that the lowest mass bin suggests a
turnover in the relation This may be a result of incompleteness though this is dicult to establish from these data
Whatever the case the lowest mass bin is excluded when tting the MZ relation The MZ relation is given by
where x  logM  10 the logarithm of the stellar mass in solar mass units zero pointed to reduce the covariance of
