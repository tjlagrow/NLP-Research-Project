Abstract We show that simple models of the chemical and spectrophotometric
evolution of galaxies can be used to explore the properties of present-day galaxies
and especially the causes of the observed variety among disc galaxies We focus on
the link between classical spirals and Low Surface Brightness galaxies

1 Introduction
In the last decades a considerable amount of observations has been
collected on Low Surface Brightness galaxies LSBs which are char-
acterised by a central surface brightness well below the Freeman disc
centre value B02165 mag arcsec2 In a related contribution in the
present Volume Monnier Ragaigne et al the samples of LSBs used
for comparison with our models are presented LSBs are relevant for
the study of the formation and evolution of galaxies in general as well
as for observational cosmology since some studies suggest that they
may be responsible for a signicant fraction of the high redshift quasar
absorbers in which gas densities and abundances can be measured on
cosmological scales eg Boissier et al 2002 and references therein
In section 3 we will compare the properties of the observed sam-
ples with the predictions of models of their chemical and spectro-
photometric evolution based on reliable models of spirals presented
in section 2
2 Models
In the contribution by N Prantzos it is shown that the properties
of nearby spiral galaxies are in good agreement with a grid of sim-
ple models of their chemical and spectrophotometric evolution These

distribution of the spin parameter  Models with   004 correspond to spirals
with Freemans surface brightness models with   006 to LSBs
models are based on i a calibration on the Milky Way ii scaling
relationships obtained in the context of the cold dark matter theory
Mo et al 1998 and iii an empirical calibration of infall time-scales
massive galaxies accreting gas more rapidly than low mass galaxies
Boissier and Prantzos 2000
The second point is the most relevant for the study of LSBs as the
scaling relations link the structural properties of the disc scalelength
and central surface density to those of the dark halo circular velocity

The index M W refers to the corresponding value in the Milky Way
The spin parameter  is a dimensionless quantity measuring the specic
angular momentum of the dark halo
Dalcanton et al 1997 already suggested that LSBs could be the
large angular momentum equivalents of normal spirals an idea also
used in the chemical evolution models of Jimenez et al 1998 Here
we will take advantage of the existence of a grid of models that are well
calibrated for spiral galaxies Figure 1 shows the surface disc brightness
obtained with the spiral galaxy models where indeed models with
  006 are found to be LSBs B  22 mag arcsec2  Integrating
over a distribution of the spin parameter this correspond to 35  of

From spirals to LSB galaxies
Figure 2 B-band central disc surface brightness left and scalelength right as a
function of the absolute magnitude of the disc component for various observational
samples see Monnier Ragaigne et al this Volume The lines indicate models for
LSB galaxies ie with large spin parameter values as indicated in the left panel
all galaxies in number In the next section we extend the models to
larger values of the spin parameter 007 009 015 021 and compare
the results with some of the available observations for LSBs
3 A comparison of models with observations
31 Central disc surface brightness and scalelength
The central disc surface brightness and the scalelength of the models
obtained with large values of the spin parameter are presented in Figure
2 as a function of the absolute magnitude of the disc component all in
the B band for a number of samples of objects of low and intermediate
surface brightness chosen to represent the wide variety among LSBs
The comparison between the two shows that these very simple models
and especially the scaling relationships provide a sound basis for the
study of LSBs
LSBs could then well be disc galaxies with larger spin parameter
than spirals As a consequence for similar masses and thus similar ab-
solute magnitudes assuming that the mass-to-light ratio does not vary
drastically the scalelengths of LSBs are expected to be larger than
for spirals Indeed the sample with intermediate surface brightness is
characterised by smaller scalelengths than the samples with very low
surface brightness galaxies
32 Chemistry
Observational evidence on the chemical evolutionary state of LSBs is
relatively scarse Their H i mass-to-light ratios on average larger than
boissiertex 2022008 051 p3
Boissier et al
in spirals seems to indicate that LSBs are less evolved This is indeed
what is found in the models the star formation eciency being much
smaller because of the smaller gas densities see Monnier Ragaigne et
al this Volume
For the same reasons chemical abundances of heavy elements are
lower In normal spirals a clear relation between mass and metal-
licity is observed eg Zaritsky et al 1994 which is reproduced in
the models owing to the mass dependence of infall timescales The
observational situation is less clear for LSBs see Figure 3 However
contrary to the case of spirals metallicity in LSBs is measured in only a
few H ii regions located at various radii in dierent galaxies these data
cannot be corrected for the unknown underlying abundance gradients
The abundances obtained in the LSB models weighted by a distribu-
tion of velocity spin parameter and star formation rate to take into
account the need for massive stars to produce observable H ii regions
are presented as the grey-scales in Figure 3 A relatively large range of
abundances is expected in rough agreement with the measurements

as a function of the absolute blue mag-
nitude of the disc component Data
are from Mc Gaugh 1994 The grey-
scale indicates expected values from
the models weighted by a distribution
of velocity spin parameter and star
formation rate
33 Colours
The main diculty for these simple models with a smooth star
formation history is their inability to explain the wide range of colours
observed Monnier Ragaigne et al this Volume Adding to the mod-
els starbursts and truncations of the star formation histories seems a
promising way to cure this problem Boissier et al in preparation
