Summary 
Proteins synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes are sorted at the Golgi apparatus level 
for delivery to various cellular destinations the plasma membrane or the extra-cellular space 
and  the  lytic  vacuole  or  lysosome  Sorting  involves  the  assembly  of  vesicles  which 
preferentially package soluble proteins with a common destination The selection of proteins 
for a particular vesicle type involves the recognition of proteins by specific receptors such as 
the vacuolar sorting receptors for vacuolar targeting Most eukaryotic organisms have one or 
two receptors to target proteins to the lytic vacuole Surprisingly plants have several members 
of the same family seven in Arabidopsis thaliana Why plants have so many proteins to sort 
soluble  proteins  to  their  respective  destinations  The  presence  of  at  least  two  types  of 
vacuoles the lytic and the storage one seems to be a partial answer In this review we analyze 
the  last  experimental  evidence  supporting  the  presence  of  different  subfamilies  of  plant 
vacuolar sorting receptors

Introduction 
In  eukaryotic  cells  proteins  synthesized  on  membrane-bound  ribosomes  are 
transported  through  the  Golgi  apparatus  and  are  sorted  for  delivery  to  various  cellular 
destinations  The  Golgi  apparatus  has  a  central  role  in  the  modification  and  sorting  of 
proteins  It  is  a  very  dynamic  compartment  made  of  distinct  cisternae  with  a  cis-trans 
organization  that  are  involved  in  vacuolar  protein  sorting  Hillmer  et  al  2001  Ward  and 
Brandizzi 2004 The classical view has been that the traffic bifurcates at the TGN to the 
constitutive  default  pathway  delivering  the  proteins  to  the  cell  surface  or  to  a  selective 
pathway sorting proteins to the endosomal membrane system Mellman and Warren 2000  
The endosomal membrane system is characterized by the presence of acid hydrolases 
and is known as lysosomeendosome in mammalian cells or vacuole in yeasts and plants The 
sorting at the TGN is mediated by transmembrane receptors recruiting cargo proteins in the 
lumen side Until 2001 it was assumed that the hetrotetrameric clathrin coat adaptator AP-1 
was responsible for clathrin-coated vesicle CCV formation but a new family of monomeric 
clathrin  coat  proteins  the  Golgi  colocalized  -ear-containing  ARF-binding  proteins  GGA 
was  identified  It  was  proposed  that  these  GGA  proteins  in  association  with  clathrin  are 
involved  in  the  creation  of  vesicles  destined  to  late  endosome  Black  and  Pelham  2000 
Puertollano  et  al  2001a  Puertollano  et  al  2001b  CCV  deliver  the  receptor-ligand 
complexes to the lysosomalvacuolar system Ghosh et al 2003 Conserved sequences at the 
receptors  cytosolic  domain  allow  the  recognition  of  the  protein  complexes  delivering  the 
vesicles to the correct destination 
The transmembrane receptors involved in the sorting process are known as vacuolar 
sorting receptors VSR The soluble hydrolases of the mammalian lysosome are marked for 
delivery  to  this  organelle  by  the  addition  of  mannose  6-phosphate  to  their  glycans  Two 
mannose  6-phosphate  receptors  MPR  were  identified  by  their  ability  to  bind  mannose  6-
phosphate  the  46  kDa  cation-dependent  MPR  and  the  300  kDa  cation-independent  MPR 
Kornfeld 1992 In addition to the delivery of acid hydrolases to the endosomes the cation-
independent  MPR  has  been  implicated  in  various  physiological  processes  including  the 
internalization  of  insulin-like  growth  factor  Gosh  et  al  2003  In  contrast  in  yeast  and 
plants the vacuolar targeting signals are part of the peptidic sequence itself Robinson and 
Hinz 1997 The only known receptor from yeast VPS10p recognizes a specific amino acid 
sequence  of  carboxypeptidase  Y  Marcusson  et  al  1994  Conibear  and  Stevens  1998 
Gerrard et al 2000a 2000b A membrane protein from yeast mannose 6-phosphate receptor 
like protein MRL1p distantly related to mammal MPR has been recently identified and may 
be a new VSR Whyte and Munro 2001 but clear evidence of this function is missing It has 
been recently found that sortilin a VPS10p-like receptor is also present in animal cells and 
seems  to  be  implicated  in  Golgi-endosome  transport  Nielsen  et  al  2001  Surprisingly 
sortilin seems to be also involved in neuronal death Nykjaer et al 2004  In plants targeting 
to  the  lytic  vacuole  is  mediated  by  an  integral  membrane  protein  named  BP-80  binding 
protein of 80 kDa This receptor identified in pea and Arabidopsis recognizes the NPIR motif 
at  the  N-terminal  of  aleurain  and  sporamin  and  has  no  sequence  homology  to  any  other 
known sorting receptor in eukaryotes Kirsch et al 1994 Paris et al 1997 Humair et al 
2001 They are type I integral membrane proteins with three repeats of an epidermal growth 
factor  motif  close  to  the  transmembrane  domain  that  may  stabilize  the  ligand-receptor 
complexes Watanabe et al 2004 In addition the N-terminal domain contains a conserved 
protease associated region The cytosolic C-terminus carries an YXXL sequence a potential 
Tyr-based  motif  which  interacts  with  the  Arabidopsis  A-adaptin  which  is  a  subunit  of  a 
putative AP-complex located at the trans-Golgi Network Happel et al 2004  
The Arabidopsis VSR multigenic family 
The  availability  of  Arabidopsis  complete  genome  revealed  the  presence  of  seven 
members of the family in this plant Some members of the Arabidopsis genes were identified 
cloned and given different names table I BP-80 came from the size of the protein binding 
the  vacuolar  targeting  sequence  from  aleurain  and  all  the  genes  were  named  accordingly 
Paris et al 1997 Hadlington and Denecke 2000 Those proteins were also named as ELP 
Epidermal  growth  factor-Like  Protein  in  agreement  to  the  presence  of  specific  protein 
motifs Ahmed et al 1997 Laval et al 1999 The last classification based on the function 
of  the  proteins  seems  the  more  convenient  and  will  be  used  in  this  review  even  if  that 
function has not been experimentally proved for all the members of the family Paris et al 
1997 Shimada et al 2003

The  main  question  we  address  here  is  why  plants  have  so  many  VSR  when  other 
eukaryotes have only one or two The common answer is that plants have a more complex 
vacuolar  system  than  other  eukaryotes  At  present  two  clearly  different  types  of  vacuoles 
have been identified in plants the lytic vacuoles equivalent to the endosomelysosome from 
mammals and the yeast vacuole and the storage vacuole present mainly in seed reserve tissue 
Paris  et  al  1996  Robinson  and  Hinz  1997  Jauh  et  al  1998  However  most  of  the 
excellent  reviews  on  the  area  considered  the  family  of  AtVSRs  as  mainly  involved  in  the 
transport to the lytic vacuole Beevers and Raikhel 1998 Neuhaus and Rogers 1998 Paris 
and Neuhaus 2002 The role of the pea receptor BP80 as a vacuolar sorting receptor was 
reported by the use of a yeast mutant knocked out on VPS10p The pea receptor was able to 
target  a  reporter  green  fluorescent  protein  construction  carrying  the  aleurain  sorting  N-
terminal  signal  to  the  lytic  vacuole  but  did  not  restore  the  vacuole  localization  of  yeast 
carboxypeptidase Y Humair et al 2001 Since yeast contains only one type of vacuole the 
lytic one which is considered as the default pathway for heterogeneous expressed membrane 
proteins the results of such experiments only partially support the in vivo function Takegawa 
et al 2003  
A  controversial  report  showed  that  a  pumpkin  protein  closely  related  to  the 
Arabidopsis VSRs PV72 was an abundant protein in precursor-accumulating vesicles from 
maturing pumpkin seeds Shimada et al 1997 PV72 was able to bind peptides derived from 
a 2S albumin as well as the precursor protein a protein found in the storage vacuoles Since 
the Arabidopsis VSRs had been isolated from CCVs delivering proteins to the lytic vacuole 
the  involvement  of  such  receptors  in  the  sorting  of  storage  proteins  was  discarded  The 
diversity of species and tissues used in those studies made difficult the interpretation of the 
results obtained so far Recently a tagged mutant for the AtVSR1 gene a close homologue to 
pumpkin PV72 was shown to secrete reserve proteins into the extracellular space However 
some storage proteins were still correctly targeted to the PSV This may indicate specificity 
between  cargo  proteins  and  the  corresponding  VSR  or  that  other  storage  proteins  were 
targeted  via  the  alternative  ER-derived  compartments    In  wild  type  seeds  the  AtVSR1 
protein  binds  the  C-terminal  peptide  of  the  12S  globulin  in  a  Ca2  dependent  manner 
Shimada  et  al  2003  Curiously  a  fusion  protein  containing  the  pumpkin  PV72  lumenal 
domain  with  an  ER-retention  signal  introduced  in  Arabidopsis  retained  NPIR-containing 
proteases in the ER but not other vacuolar proteins Watanabe et al 2004 This indicates 
that  PV72  may  recognize  proteins  to  be  sorted  to  the  lytic  or  the  storage  vacuole  It  is 
interesting to point out that the lytic enzymes were normally sorted to the lytic vacuoles in the 
atvsr1  mutant  Shimada  et  al  2003  It  clearly  showed  that  AtVSR1  is  involved  in  the 
transport of some soluble proteins to the storage vacuoles but not in the sorting of proteins to 
the  lytic  compartment  This  brings  another  question  How  are  degraded  the  miss-sorted 
reserve proteins in the atvsr1 mutant We do not know the answer however we can advance 
some possibilities First the reserve proteins may be internalized to the lytic vacuole by an 
endocytic  pathway  not  well  known  in  plants  Second  they  may  be  degraded  in  the 
extracellular  space  by  secreted  proteases  Recent  evidences  on  the  cell  wall  proteome  in 
Arabidopsis indicate that an important number of proteases are normally present in the cell 
wall of rosettes and other organs Boudart et al 2005 In a recent work Jolliffe et al 2004 
showed  that  the  transport  of  proricin  and  pro  2S  albumin  to  the  protein  storage  vacuole  in 
castor bean involves members of the VSR family These data support the work of Shimada et 
al 2003 and indicate that our understanding of the role of VSR in protein sorting is still 
incomplete  To  add  a  new  level  of  complexity  we  have  to  take  into  consideration  that  in 
seeds  the  protein  storage  vacuole  includes  a  membrane-bound  compartment  of  different 
composition and function Jiang et al 2001 Nishizawa et al 2003 It was proposed that this 
globoid  cavity  represents  a  lytic  like  compartment  inside  the  PSV  These  results  are  very 
exciting since we can imagine that at least in seeds some members of vacuolar receptors can 
deliver proteins in a specific compartment of the protein storage vacuole 
It  should  be  noted  that  in  plants  in  addition  to  the  classical  transport  via  Golgi 
pathway some proteins and other molecules can apparently be stored for shorter or longer 
periods  of  time  in  endoplasmic  reticulum-derived  compartments  In  some  cases  these  ER 
derived compartments travel to and are incorporated into vacuoles Plant cells appear to have 
flexibility  in  using  the  ER  to  assemble  storage  organelles  So  far  ER-derived  storage 
organelles  such  as  protein  bodies  and  oil  bodies  have  been  described  primarily  in  seeds 
Chrispeels  and  Herman  2000  At  present  it  is  not  known  if  membrane  receptors  are 
involved in the recruitment of proteins for ER-derived vesicles 
The inhibition of VSR gene expression affects germination 
In  yeast  the  knockout  of  the  VPS10  gene  does  not  show  a  visible  phenotype  only 
some proteases are miss-sorted but the cell growth perfectly well A similar situation seems to 
occur in plants where tagged mutants had not been particularly useful for the understanding 
of protein trafficking Zouhar et al 2004 The only visible phenotype was obtained by an 
antisense construction blocking the expression of all the members of the AtVSR family where 
most  of  the  lines  failed  to  germinate  Laval  et  al  2003  Germination  is  completely 
dependent  on  stored  reserves  since  the  embryo  has  not  yet  acquired  autotrophy  In  this 
particular situation are all the Arabidopsis VSRs involved or only some of them Recently it 
was shown that germination depends on stored and not on neosynthesized mRNA Rajjou et 
al  2004  Subsequent  growth  of  the  seedling  needs  the  newly  synthesized  mRNA  An 
expression study of the AtVSR family indicates that only three of the genes are transcribed in 
dry seeds namely AtVSR1 3 and 4 and after imbibition The others genes are expressed only 
in the growing seedling and later Laval et al 2003 Nakabayashi et al 2005 It seems clear 
that germination depends not only on the reserve proteins from the storage vacuole but also 
on the proteases from the lytic vacuole 
Phylogenetic trees suggest different functions 
The N-terminal moiety of VSR proteins binds the cargo proteins that will be targeted 
to a particular destination The alignment of the central part of the Arabidopsis VSR gives a 
Phylogenetic  tree  showing  three  main  groups  Paris  and  Neuhaus  2002  Shimada  et  al 
2003 On the other hand the C-terminus region contains the receptor sequences that should 
bind to the cytosolic proteins involved in vesicular traffic from the TGN to the various pre-
vacuolar compartments from the plant cell We have constructed a phylogenetic tree aligning 
the C-terminal region of the AtVSR family plus some other close related proteins found in 
databases Fig 1 This tree gives the same three groups obtained previously by alignment of 
the N-terminal moiety Two Arabidopsis members AtVSR3 and 4 and two rice sequences 
are in the same branch as the pea PB80 which was found to be involved in the sorting to the 
lytic vacuole Paris et al 1997 Humair et al 2001  A second group assembles the pumpkin 
PV72  AtVSR1  and  2  plus  a  wheat  and  Vigna  members  This  branch  comprises  VSR 
members involved in targeting storage proteins to the storage vacuole Shimada et al 1997 
Shimada et al 2003 The open question is the putative function of the third branch Those 
three members are normally expressed in almost all the tissues Laval et al 2003 even if the 
proteins have not been isolated yet Based on the expression data of all the AtVSR genes in 
various organs and at different developmental stages a cluster analysis was performed not 
shown this tree is quite similar to the one shown in Fig 1

region  between  Trp-538  and 
Asp-624  of  AtVSR4  was

regions  of  the  other  proteins 
from  ProDom  database  and 
tools Servant et al 2002  
It has been shown by immuno-electron microscopy that the pea BP-80 and AtVSR1 
were found in CCV at the trans face of the Golgi and in prevacuoles Kirsh et al 1994 
Paris et al 1997 Amhed et al 1998 This shows clearly that the VSR is not found in the 
final destination but only in the compartments where the sorting is made and in intermediate 
vesicles Using antibodies raised against peptides shared by all members of the family it was 
shown  that  a  VSR-like  protein  was  present  in  a  fraction  enriched  in  plasma  membrane 
proteins from Arabidopsis Laval et al 1999 Little is known on the endocytic pathway in 
plants  This  pathway  had  been  extensively  studied  in  mammals  where  the  calcium 
independent-MPR  can  sort  surface  proteins  to  the  endosome  as  well  as  to  target  soluble 
proteins  to  the  lysosome  We  propose  here  that  the  third  branch  may  group  plant  proteins 
involved in the endocytic pathway Another putative role for the members of that branch may 
be  their  involvement  in  the  sorting  of  surface-destined  cargo  proteins  in  polarized  cells 
Animal polarized cells will deliver surface proteins to the apical or basolateral surface into 
distinct carriers at the TNG Traub and Kornfeld 1997 Bonifacio and Traub 2003 Gosh et 
al 2003  It is known that membrane proteins like the auxin transporter PIN1 are secreted 
to  the  basolateral  surface  of  most  cells  Palme  and  Galweiler  1999  Auxin  transport 
inhibitors and the vesicle trafficking inhibitor brefeldine A blocked PIN 1 cycling Geldner 
et al 2001 Petrasek et al 2003 It seems possible that the secretion of proteins into specific 
extracellular  areas  does  not  follow  the  default  pathway  and  may  need  sorting  membrane 
proteins Figure 2 gives a schematic view of the state of the art with some experimentally 
proved roles plus some new hypothesis that may stimulate research in the area It seems clear 
that the targeting of proteins to different locations within the plant cell is more complex than 
supposed previously and need intensive research
