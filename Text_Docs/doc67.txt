Maurice Gross 1934-2001 was both a great linguist and 
a  pioneer  in  natural  language  processing  This  article  is 
written in homage to his memory1 
Maurice Gross is remembered as a vital man surrounded 
by  a  lively  group  constituted  by  his  laboratory  the 
LADL2  and  by  his  international  network  RELEX  He 
and  his  group  always  resolutely  steered  away  from  any 
kind  of  abstemiousness  or  abstinence  He  selected  three 
of his first collaborators in 1968 from among his bistrot 
pals  of  longstanding  Judging  by  their  later  scientific 
production the selection was done with sharp judgment 
eg Guillet Leclre 1992 Meunier 1999 A convivial 
atmosphere picnics drinks at the lab and other revelries 
were  the hallmarks  of  his  group    though  he  has  been 
perceived on other occasions as a tyrannical father 
As a linguist Maurice Gross contributed to the revival of 
formal  linguistics  in  the  1960s  and  he  created  and 
implemented  an  efficient  methodology  for  descriptive 
lexicology  As  specialist  of  natural  language  processing 
NLP  he  was  also  a  pioneer  of  linguistics-based 
processing

idiosyncratic  properties  of 
The  best-known  theory  of  Maurice  Gross  is  that  the 
description  of 
lexical 
elements  ie  the  description  of  the  lexicon  is  an 
essential  part  of  the  description  of  the  syntax  and 
semantics  of  a  language  He  undertook  to  implement 
Zellig  Harris  theory  of  syntax  which  in  fact  also 
includes a good deal of semantics within a well-crafted 
description3

His  work  comprises  not  only  a  vast  array  of  books  and 
articles among the most significant being those of 1975 
and 1981 but also a large data set tables of syntactico-
semantic  properties  of  thousands  of  lexical  entries  in 
French    not  a  common  achievement  among  linguists

Zellig  Harris  to  that  of  Maurice  Gross  and  it  is  sometimes 
difficult to differentiate between their respective contributions

Fig 1 A Lexicon-Grammar table Salkoff 2002 
Such tables are known as Lexicon-Grammar tables or as 
LADL  tables  The  first  tables  were  constructed  around 
1970  long  before  comparable  lexicons  Gross  1975 
Some are now available on the web httpinfolinguuniv-
mlvfrenglish  follow  Linguistic  Resources  Intimately 
associated with the name of Maurice Gross they are an 
example of the originality creativity and fecundity of his 
scientific thought 
Firstly they are rich repositories of fact As compared to 
other  syntactico-semantic  lexicons  Lexicon-Grammar 
tables have three salient features 
-  senses  of  verbs  are  distinguished  and  represented  in 
separate lexical entries for example for John missed his 
daughter and John missed the target 
inside  a  verb  entry  different  constructions  are 
represented  for  example  John  missed  his  daughter  and 
Mary was missed by her father in that sense the tables 
contain the essential elements of a grammar  
-  the  number  of  entries  is  quite  comprehensive  eg 
15000 French verbs 
Secondly  these  tables  are  also  a  means  of  linguistic 
investigation  During  the  construction  they  are  an 
abundant source of discovery Once complete the tables 
are readable and constitute a tool for further research by 
the  international  community  of  linguists  including  for 
researchers that do not share the theoretical assumptions 
of their authors 
And they were designed as such This is an example of 
the  generosity  of  Maurice  Gross  He  also  used  to  pass 
ideas  on  to  students  and  colleagues  happy  when  they 
were developed in publications and never caring whether 
he was acknowledged as their originator 
The work completed under his supervision includes a set 
of  morpho-syntactic  lexicons  called  DELA  Courtois 
1990 2004 We illustrate this resource with a sentence 
automaton  which  is  automatically  derived  from  these 
lexicons  and  displays  the  lexical  tags  of  a  sequence  of 
words Fig 2 
12 Predicative nouns 
The analysis of sentences with a predicative noun and a 
support  verb  is  a  well-known  aspect  of  the  theory  of 
Zellig  Harris  and  Maurice  Gross  Harris  1957  Many 
nouns  can  function  as  sentence  predicates  playing  the 
same part as verbs like in 
Human language technologies have an increasing 
importance 
In  such  constructions  the  noun  is  accompanied  by  a 
support  verb  later  termed  light  verb  by  some  writers 
eg  Grimshaw  Mester  1988  The  importance  of 
predicative nouns for natural language processing comes 
from  the  fact  that  most  technical  nouns  are  predicative 
and that in technical texts many predicates are nouns  
Maurice  Gross  directed  studies  on  predicative  nouns  in 
French and other languages Large-scale results emerged 
in  the  1970s  Giry-Schneider  1978  and  generally 
validated the theory Nonetheless this theory was felt to 
be iconoclastic and faced fierce scientific opposition for 
years It eventually gained greater acceptance during the 
1990s4  Resistance  to  the  theory  did  not  influence  his 
opinion  because  Gross  was  aware  that  his  opponents 
arguments  did  not  stand  up  to  analysis  He  knew  better 
the  predicative 
nounssupport verbs model did not work 
Maurice Gross could be obstinate he liked contradiction 
and  his  critical  mind  was  developed  to  an  uncommon 
degree As regards the combination of wine with food  
a far weightier issue than predicative nouns  Maurice 
Gross  appreciated  some  red  wines  with  fish  and  some 
white  wines  with  cheese  and  he  enjoyed  demonstrating 
his  irritation  and  amusement  when  he  received  slighted 
remarks from wine waiters in classier restaurants 
they  did  which  details  of 
13 Compounds and idioms 
Gross set up a series of studies on compound lexical units 
eg Freckleton 1985 Machonis 1985 breaking with a 
long tradition that holds that such phrases are exceptions 
worth only of anecdotal remarks Compound lexical units 
are phrases described as lexical units Gross 1986a as 
Cell phones have antennas 
They can be defined by their lack of compositionality and 
the  distributional  frozenness  of  their  elements  The 
findings  showed  that  languages  have  a  large  number  of 
                                                      
4 The same can be said for predicative adjectives as in Human 
language technologies are increasingly important 
compound  predicates  such  as  make  ends  meet  and  that 
compound  entries  are  often  more  numerous  than  the 
simple-word  entries  for  the  same  part  of  speech  In 
French  for  instance  Maurice  Gross  indexed  26000 
verbal idioms5 Gross 1982 and 12000 adverbial idioms 
Gross 1986b 
He  devised  the  notion  of  local  grammars  Gross  1997 
for  semi-frozen  phrases  and  for  sequences  with  frozen 
behaviour  inside  a  specific  domain  like  cloudy  with 
sunny periods 
The term multi-word units Glass Hazen 1998 is more 
recent  It  groups  support-verb  constructions  compound 
lexical units semi-frozen phrases and collocations

14 Methodological legacy 
Maurice  Gross  contributed  centrally  to  the  construction 
of rigorous empirical methods for syntactic and semantic 
description  borrowing 
experimental  sciences  like  biology  and  physics  This  is 
probably  his  greatest  achievement  but  it  obviously 
accrued  still  further weight  from  his  parallel  descriptive 
work which showed that his methods were applicable to 
real  unrestricted  data  Historically  this  methodological 
work was part of the international movement in scientific 
formalised  linguistics  that  took  place  in  the  1960s  In 
1968  Maurice  Gross  also  contributed  to  the  foundation 
of  the  Linguistics  Department  of  the  University  of 
Vincennes and was the editor of Langages 9 a volume 
of  articles  by  major  contemporary  players  such  as 
Yehoshua  Bar-Hillel  Noam  Chomsky  Maurice  Gross 
Zellig Harris and Marcel-Paul Schtzenberger 
Resorting 
linguistic 
methodology may sound strange to many linguists even 
today but it is justified by the fact that the only possible 
source  of  knowledge 
empirical observation The central epistemological notion 
there  is  the  reproducibility  of  experiments  ie  that  the 
results  of  observation  should  not  depend  on 
observers  Obviously  the  objective  of  reproducibility  is 
particularly  difficult  to  attain  in  linguistics  In  addition 
any steps taken in order to ensure reproducibility should 
be  compatible  with  the  objective  of  actual  large-scale 
description  Maurice  Gross  advocated  a  subjective 
method with a collective control empirical observations 
are performed through introspection by a team of native-
speaker  linguists  This  is  how  the  Lexicon-Grammar 
tables of French verbs were constructed 
Some  argue  that  sufficient  reproducibility  can  only  be 
ensured  by  way  of  total  objectivity  However  whatever 
precautions can be taken in order to ensure the objectivity 
of  results  blind  experimentation  exclusive  resort  to 
attested  language  productions  they  are  in  practice 
incompatible  with

information  provided 
Maurice  Gross  designed  and  implemented  a  set  of 
methods and tools for the manual elaboration of language 
resources of quality 
As compared to common practices in language resource 
construction  and  management  the  quality  of  resources 
constructed  with  these  methods  can  be  characterised  by 
four features 
-  Coverage  is  large  which  is  obtained  by  systematic 
browsing  of  segments  of  the  language  parts  of  speech 
for instance 
-  Representation  is  formal  eg  encoded  to  permit 
computational 
language 
processing purposes 
- Models for different languages are parallel 
- Information is particularly accurate since it is based on 
manual  analyses  of  introspective  or  attested  data  by 
trained  linguists  and  errors  are  corrected  directly  when 
discovered  In  resources  automatically  derived  from 
rules  or 
approximate  when  an  error  in  a resource is  discovered 
methods to correct it are not sure to be successful and can 
bring about further errors 
This  level  of  quality  is  obtained  as  said  through 
essentially  manual  construction  and  maintenance  This 
implies two additional features 
-  Resources  are  readable  to  a  high  degree  as  is 
exemplified  by  the  two  figures  above  the  relevant 
information  is  dense  when  necessary  as  in  the  second 
figure the display is graphical 
- The accumulation of resources is gradual thus allowing 
for  the  progressive  collaborative  construction  of  large 
resources from independent elements 
In the application of these methods Maurice Gross kept a 
watchful  eye  on  the  level  of  formalization  In  complete 
agreement  with  Zellig  Harriss  objective  of  a  formally 
minimal  theory6  he  was  very  keen  on  minimalism  in 
abstract  complexity  He  avoided  giving  new  names  to 
already named notions as computational linguists usually 
do7 He carefully avoided creating new abstract notions or 
models  or  building  complex  abstract  representations 
unless they were really useful For example the VP node 
in  syntactic  trees  is  useless  and  so  is  the  distinction 
between  PP  and  NP  nodes  the  presenceabsence  and 
lexical value of the preposition can perfectly be specified 
without  two  distinct  nodes  Such  nodes  introduce 
unnecessary  complexity  into  syntactic  trees  Fig  3 
whereas  the  complexity  of  the  phenomena  themselves 
calls for the simplest possible tools Fig 4

6  This  difference  between  Zellig  Harris  and  Noam  Chomsky 
shows even in their respective conceptions of transformations 
for Harris a transformation relates observable sentence forms 
for Chomsky it is a device to transform a deep structure into a 
surface structure

many writers that now they have to call syntax deep syntax

23 Finite-state processing 
Maurice  Grosss  approach  to  the  use  of  the  finite 
automaton  model 
for  NLP  was  pragmatic  and 
constructive  Soon  after  the  creation  of  this  model  the 
famous  article  by  Chomsky  1956  was  interpreted  as  a 
ban  on 
transgressions Woods 1970 Much later Maurice Gross 
1989a  gave  examples 
finite 
automaton  would  be  a  convenient  invaluable  tool  for 
syntactic description Groups related to the University of 
Helsinki and Rank Xerox were of the same opinion and 
it  came  to  be  one  of  the  most  popular  models  The 
RELEX  network  began  to  use  finite  automata  with  the 
graphical  editor  developed  by  Silberztein 
1993 
Empirical  studies  led  to  the  design  of  a  model  of 
lexicalised  syntactic  grammar  in  the  form  of  a  large 
network  of  finite  automata  or  recursive  transition

24 Rules vs idiosyncrasies 
I myself often heard that Maurice Gross was pessimistic 
because  he  did  not  have  confidence  in  rules  where 
language is concerned 
The  notions  of  rule  and  idiosyncrasy  are  symmetrical 
Rules  are  generic  statements  such  as  nouns  in  -s  are 
plural  whereas 
idiosyncrasies  are  particular  facts 
usually  about  lexical  items  such  as  beans  is  plural  or 
means  is  singular  Both  forms  can  express  formal 
knowledge which raises interesting issues when a rule is 
right what is the use of the corresponding idiosyncrasies 
and  vice  versa  should  language  resources  be  based  on 
rules or on idiosyncrasies 
In  practice  rules  tend  to  be  inaccurate  because  of  the 
ubiquity of chaotic behaviour and exceptions in language 
as  our  example  nouns  in  -s  are  plural  suggests  When 
we devise rules manually we have a natural tendency to 
over-estimate  their  predictive  power  when  they  are 
automatically  derived 
approximate When idiosyncratic data are available they 
are  more  often  accurate 
in  conformity  with 
observable reality 
On  the  other  hand  rules  can  be  automatically  inferred 
whereas  accounts  of  idiosyncratic  facts  have  to  be 
recorded  manually  a  work  which  obviously  requires 
time skill and effort and is therefore more costly 
In  this  trade-off  between  accuracy  and  cost  software 
engineers tend to prefer rules even if slightly inaccurate 
because  they  feel  that  rules  achieve  a  higher  level  of 
than  collections  of  particular  facts  In 
automation 
addition 
the  manual 
construction of language resources is difficult and often 
that  it  is  tedious  However  this  is  not  a  specialists 
opinion  since  they  seldom  have  the  opportunity  to 
engage  in  such  tasks  On  the  contrary  Maurice  Gross 
they  unanimously  say 
corpora

Fig 3 A syntactic tree with useless nodes 
This  position  was  consistent  with  his  own  character 
Pragmatic Maurice Gross liked simplicity and had good 
sense  He  was  not  easy  fooled  by  apparently  attractive 
and  brilliant  but  poor  ideas  He  was  delighted  by  the 
Sokal  1996  hoax  against  fashionable 
intellectual 
discourse 
22 Linguistics-based language processing 
Right from the beginning Maurice Gross was aware that 
formal descriptions of natural languages could be applied 
to  language  processing  The  first  opportunity  to  study 
linguistics  had  been  offered  to  him  in  the  1950s  in  a 
machine translation laboratory during the first period of 
enthusiasm  for  machine  translation  In  the  1960s  he 
founded  and  pioneered  the  concept  of  linguistics-based 
NLP  long  before  the  international  interest  for  language 
resources  In  this  approach  the  construction  of  NLP 
programs  is  based  on  language  resources  lexicons  and 
grammars  which  are  in  turn  based  on  descriptive 
linguistics He began to apply this concept in the 1960s 
and 1970s 
However  statistics-based  NLP  developed  and  became 
dominant  in  the  1980s  the  only  language  resources 
required  for  this  approach  to  NLP  are  corpora  While 
specialists  of  linguistics-based  NLP  were  developing 
their  methods  the  bulk  of  the  NLP  community  was 
discouraged by the difficulty and cost of such work but 
aware  that  language  resources  were  required  for  the 
fulfilment of their objectives This paradox was called the 
bottleneck  of  NLP  The 
international  academic 
community  eventually  got  an  interest  for  language 
resources but only in the 2000s 
In  spite  of  the  difficulty  and  cost  of  linguistics-based 
language  resources  Maurice  Gross 
construction  of 
such  discovery 
scientific  practice 
took  evident  pleasure  in  assembling  and  disassembling 
mechanisms of language 
Linguists are obviously interested in discovering rules In 
requires 
observing  facts  as  completely  as  possible  but  most 
linguists  do  not  check  large  numbers  of  idiosyncratic 
facts  and  they  never  say  explicitly  why  do  they  also 
consider studies on lexis as tedious or as a second-rate 
or  shameful  work  In  any  case  such  studies  have  been 
consistently neglected 
Back  to  the  1960s  when  Maurice  Gross  undertook  his 
work on lexis issues about rules and idiosyncrasies were 
being discussed among linguists Harris 1951 admitted 
the necessity of representing lexical restrictions We now 
have sets of morphemic components and residues so set 
that  as  nearly  as  possible  all  sequences  and 
combinations of them occur  It may not be convenient 
to represent by means of components such limitations of 
occurrence  among  morphemes  as  do  not  intersect  with 
other limitations involving the same morphemes or as do 
not lead to the division of a class into sub-classes clearly 
differentiated on that basis  This is frequently the case 
for morphemes classes which are grouped together into a 
general class on the basis of major similarities but which 
have small and unpatterned differences in distribution 
So did Chomsky 1962 There are in fact exceptions to 
many rules given above perhaps all These will have to 
be  separately 
listed  unless  some  more  general 
formulation  can  be  found  to  account  for  them  as  well 
  But  discovery  of  exceptions 
to  grammatical 
generalizations  is  of  no  consequence  in  itself  except 
when  it  leads  to  an  alternative  more  comprehensive 
generalization 
And  again  Chomsky  1965  Much  of  lexical  structure 
is in fact simply a classification induced by the system of 
phonological  and  syntactic  rules  Postal  has  suggested 
furthermore  that  there  should  be  a  general  lexical 
analysis of lexical items with respect to each rule R into 
those  which  must  those  which  may  and  those  which 
cannot be subject to R and has investigated some of the 
consequences  of 
there  remain 
possibilities  simply 
numerous  relatively  unexplored  ways  to  deal  with  the 
problems  that  arise  when  the  structure  of  a  lexicon  is 
considered seriously  For the present one can barely 
go beyond mere taxonomic arrangement of data Whether 
these  limitations  are  intrinsic  or  whether  a  deeper 
analysis  can  succeed  in  unraveling  some  of  these 
difficulties remains an open question 
But  none  of 
theoretical 
observations  to  the  empirical  description  of  a  language 
including its lexis 
Maurice  Gross  was 
to  consider  such  a 
programme as a priority to draw the consequences and to 
take up the challenge His Transformational Grammar of 
French 1968 1977 1986b is a scientific milestone As 
Amr Ibrahim 2002 puts it it clearly shows the limits of 
rule-based  formal  accounts  of  a  language  highlighting 
insurmountable  obstacles 
representation  of 
numerous  apparently 
insignificant  phenomena  even 
limited to the scope of simple sentence 
this  assumption  I  mention 
them  shifted  from  such 
indicate 
the  first 
insisting 
Zellig  Harriss  theory  was  a  sound  basis  for  such  a 
research  programme  and  he  supported  Maurice  Gross 
Meanwhile  Noam  Chomsky  was 
idiosyncratic  facts  were  not  worth  investigating  Gross 
1973  in  French  and  the  famous  1979  version  in 
English criticised the practices of generative grammar on 
these grounds 
Maurice  Gross  programme  is  ambitious  because  it 
requires  the  meticulousness  of  an  entomologist  but  he 
implemented it in a remarkably practical way because he 
had the wisdom to recognise priorities and leave the rest 
for  later  generations  For  example  restrictions  on  verb 
tenses are not represented in the present state of Lexicon-
Grammar tables of French 
Une rcompense est promise  Luc par Marie 
 A reward is being promised to Luke by Mary  
Une rcompense a t promise  Luc par Marie 
 A reward was promised to Luke by Mary  
Neither are productive pronominal constructions such as 
Une telle rcompense se promet facilement 
 Such a reward is easily promised  
Maurice  Gross  decision  to  launch  his  programme 
required  audacity  practicality  good 
sense  and  
intellectual  honesty  He  was  not  afraid  of  data  He 
probably described the situation calmly in such terms as 
One  has  to  study  all  sentence  types  and  all  types  of 
verbs  Well  lets  see  what  we  find  This  indicates  his 
ability to go to the heart of a problem with precision and 
lucidity  and  to  express  his  conclusions  with  a  brutality 
and provocation that gave him some Voltairian sense of 
humour 
He exercised the same humour in his ferocious comments 
on  scientific  adversaries  with  no  regard  for  political 
correctness  and  through  a  collection  of  favoured  put-
downs  such  as  They  are  all  illiterates  Hes  lightly 
mentally  handicapped  Hes  a  sick  man  Their 
arrogance is equalled only by their incompetence and so 
25 Corpora vs lexicons and grammars 
In  the  currently  dominant  model  of  NLP  more  or  less 
language-independent  programs  infer  information  on 
input text from rules acquired by frequency-based corpus 
processing 
In practical terms the extensive use of this model makes 
language  resource  management  cheaper  The  corpora 
used  by  the  worlds  programs  make  up  a  largely  stable 
set  operations  to  enhance  or  extend  them  or  to  create 
new ones are much less frequent than operations making 
use of them In addition constructing corpora and even 
tagged corpora is a smaller investment than constructing 
lexicons and grammars The information in state-of-the-
art tagged corpora is less complete than the information 
in  state-of-the-art  lexicons  and  grammars  Coverage  of 
lexical  elements  is  poorer Structural  complexity  is  kept 
smaller  because  of  the  computational  limitations  of 
frequency-based  inference  programs  The  annotation  of 
multi-word units eg make ends meet is poorer Sense 
distinctions eg between John missed his daughter and 
statistics-based  programs 
John  missed  the  target  are  not  made  Indirectly  this 
policy  limits  the  number  of  linguists  to  be  educated  by 
universities and hired by companies 
But  the  price  to  be  paid  for  this  limitation  of  costs  is  a 
lower  quality  of  product  Maurice  Gross  worked  much 
more  on  lexicons  and  grammars  than  on  corpora 
Inference-based  or 
compensate  for  part  of  the  difference  of  information 
content  but  cannot  compete  with  manually  constructed 
lexicons  and  grammars  because 
the  automatically 
inferred information is only approximate 
There  are  two  alternative  approaches  linguistics-based 
processing making use of manually constructed lexicons 
and  grammars  and  hybrid  processing  In  the  present 
situation  they  are  perceived  as  factors  of  quality  and 
progress  as  is  illustrated  by  the  increasing  use  of 
compound-word 
lexicons  by 
language  engineering 
companies and search engines 
This  debate  is  connected  to  the  controversy  between 
corpus linguistics and introspective linguistics 
Introspective  linguists  use  introspection  a  subjective 
human  faculty  as  one  of  the  sources  of  linguistic 
knowledge  Corpus  linguists  in  contrast  are  usually 
antipathetic  to  the  use  of  introspective  data  Some  of 
them  use  the  term  armchair  linguistics  to  suggest  that 
introspective  linguistics  fails  to  deal  with  the  reality  of 
language and that this reality is accessible only through 
attested 
linguistic  productions  However  negative 
information such as the inacceptability of some linguistic 
forms  is  also  an  aspect  of  the  reality  of  languages 
whereas  it  is  accessible  only  through  introspection  and 
not  through  corpus  exploration  In  addition  there  is  no 
example  of  a  large-coverage  formalized  lexicon  or 
grammar constructed on the basis of corpus linguistics 
Maurice Gross was not opposed to the use of corpora but 
his practice evolved with time He began to use corpora 
only  when  a  professional  tool  Silberztein  1993  was 
available to explore them And this tool was based on the 
lexicons  constructed  under  his  supervision  In  fact  no 
work  is  more  inadequately  described  by  the  term 
armchair linguistics than his  
His  position  on  the  respective  potential  of  corpora 
lexicons and grammars conflicted both with the statistics-
based  approach  to  NLP  and  with  the  positions  of  strict 
corpus  linguists  Among  the  reasons  why  his  scientific 
arguments could not persuade them we find a number of 
extra-scientific  reasons  and  in  particular  sociological 
explanations The opposition between statistics-based and 
linguistics-based NLP is founded on the division between 
engineers  and  linguists  a  very  strong  cultural  gap  and 
the  opposition  between 
introspective  and  corpus 
linguistics had many features of a generation gap Human 
factors like these can have such a power on peoples and 
even  scholars  minds  that  they  can  prevent  them  from 
accepting perfectly rational argument As an independent 
thinker  Gross  was  not  impressed  by  a  consensus  based 
partly on non-scientific reasoning 
This  particular  personal  trait  showed  in  the  way  he 
educated his students When he talked with them  and 
he invested a lot of time in the education of some of them 
 he focused on scientific matters leaving them to find 
themselves  training  in  more  mundane  skills  or  political 
strategies 
26 A few scientific fashions 
Needless to say Maurice Gross did not make concessions 
to  unjustified  scientific  fads  and  fashions  His  positions 
indicate a remarkably long-term view and intuition Here 
are  three  examples  of  scientific  fashions  he  struggled 
against with solid scientific arguments on his side 
261 Machine translation without a lexicon 
Not  only  did  Maurice  Gross  1972  insist  that  lexicons 
are  required  for  machine  translation  but  also  that  the 
lexicon  is  the  first  element  that  should  be  constructed 
because  virtually  all  other  components  depend  on  it 
Machine translation is now regularly taken as an example 
of  a  field  that  requires  lexicons  The  modern  notion  of 
translation  memories  is  just  a  variant  of  the  notion  of 
lexicon 
called  machine-readable 
262 Deriving lexicons from conventional dictionaries 
The idea of deriving lexical resources from conventional 
dictionaries 
dictionaries 
MRDs  became  amazingly  popular  in  the  end  of  the 
1980s It appeared as an alternative to the costly task of 
manually  constructing  lexical  resources  Maurice  Gross 
1989b denounced this trend as an illusion and a wrong 
answer  to  a  real  problem  showing  that  information  is 
much  less  formal  and  systematic  in  dictionaries  written 
for human readers than in the resources required for NLP 
This prediction was confirmed years later the results of 
these researches were disappointing Ide Vronis 1993 
lemma  excluded 
263 Small tagsets 
The  most  commonly  used  tagsets  are  small  they  have 
between  15  to  100  tags  which  is  what  is  needed  to 
encode  morpho-syntax 
in  many 
languages  The  most  basic  operations  on  tags  are  word 
annotation  assigning  tags  to  words  and  ambiguity 
resolution  removing  wrong  tags  The  latter  problem  is 
far  more  challenging  than  the  former  Both  depend 
heavily on the size of the tagset 
Maurice  Gross  used  to  warn  that  larger  tagsets  are 
required  for  handling  lemmata  or  syntactico-semantic 
information However since the 1990s most of the field 
seems to have considered that one should keep on using 
small  tagsets  as  long  as  technology  to  solve  lexical 
ambiguity is not available This view aims at limiting the 
complexity  of  tagged  text  which  is  used  as  input  for 
further  operations  But 
investigation  of  approaches  to  annotation  as  well  as 
approaches to ambiguity removal 
International interest for larger tagsets has progressively 
increased during the last 5 years 
it  also  severely 
limits 
264 Comment 
Superficial  scientific  fashions  appear  from  time  to  time 
and  can  endure  even  though  not  always  a  sign  of 
progress  They  may  lead  research  in  wrong  directions 
and  thus  cause  waste  This  is  likely  because  research 
outcomes are not known beforehand But it is interesting 
to notice cases where failure could have been avoided by 
paying attention to scientific arguments presented by an 
outstanding scholar 
The current mechanisms of scientific democracy and in 
particular  peer  review  regulate  research  agendas  and 
undoubtedly represent progress but they cannot prevent 
undesirable 
these  checks  and  balances 
developed  progressively  during  the  career  of  Maurice 
Gross  and were  quite  well  installed  even  20  years  ago 
but  they  failed  to  prevent  short-sighted  views  from 
invading the field for years after 
fashions 
3 Institutional legacy 
In addition to his works Maurice Grosss legacy includes 
an  enduring  research  infrastructure  made  up  of  the 
following elements 
-  an  informal  network  of  specialists  of  linguistics-based 
language resources RELEX 
-  a  series  of  International  Conferences  on  Lexis  and 
Grammar  held  since  1981  Liverpool  2005  Palermo 
2006 
-  an  international  journal  with  a  selection  committee 
Lingvistic Investigationes published by Benjamins 
- a model and a format for lexical resources implemented 
in  numerous  languages  the  DELA  format  Courtois 
1990 The model the format and the resources were the 
main  source  of  inspiration  for  the  development  of 
standards in lexical resources by the Genelex project and 
indirectly for later standards 
Conclusion 
Through  the  originality  of  his  legacy  and  his  long-term 
vision Maurice Gross is an impressive scientist Most of 
his innovations even those dating back to the 1960s and 
1970s  are  now  becoming  increasingly  accepted  by  the 
scientific community around the world It is all the more 
interesting to notice how much and for how long they met 
with resistance when he first expressed them 
Maurice Gross is worth reading now and for some time to 
come His work is more innovative than that presented at 
many  high-profile  conferences  and  journals  this  year 
And it will be so next year

Maurice Gross 1934-2001 was both a great linguist and 
a  pioneer  in  natural  language  processing  This  article  is 
written in homage to his memory1 
Maurice Gross is remembered as a vital man surrounded 
by  a  lively  group  constituted  by  his  laboratory  the 
LADL2  and  by  his  international  network  RELEX  He 
and  his  group  always  resolutely  steered  away  from  any 
kind  of  abstemiousness  or  abstinence  He  selected  three 
of his first collaborators in 1968 from among his bistrot 
pals  of  longstanding  Judging  by  their  later  scientific 
production the selection was done with sharp judgment 
eg Guillet Leclre 1992 Meunier 1999 A convivial 
atmosphere picnics drinks at the lab and other revelries 
were  the hallmarks  of  his  group    though  he  has  been 
perceived on other occasions as a tyrannical father 
As a linguist Maurice Gross contributed to the revival of 
formal  linguistics  in  the  1960s  and  he  created  and 
implemented  an  efficient  methodology  for  descriptive 
lexicology  As  specialist  of  natural  language  processing 
NLP  he  was  also  a  pioneer  of  linguistics-based 
processing 
1 Linguistics 
idiosyncratic  properties  of 
The  best-known  theory  of  Maurice  Gross  is  that  the 
description  of 
lexical 
elements  ie  the  description  of  the  lexicon  is  an 
essential  part  of  the  description  of  the  syntax  and 
semantics  of  a  language  He  undertook  to  implement 
Zellig  Harris  theory  of  syntax  which  in  fact  also 
includes a good deal of semantics within a well-crafted 
description3 
11 Results lexicons and grammars 
His  work  comprises  not  only  a  vast  array  of  books  and 
articles among the most significant being those of 1975 
and 1981 but also a large data set tables of syntactico-
semantic  properties  of  thousands  of  lexical  entries  in 
French    not  a  common  achievement  among  linguists 
As an illustration of this type of resource we reproduce 
an excerpt of a table of English verbs Fig 1

Zellig  Harris  to  that  of  Maurice  Gross  and  it  is  sometimes 
difficult to differentiate between their respective contributions

Fig 1 A Lexicon-Grammar table Salkoff 2002 
Such tables are known as Lexicon-Grammar tables or as 
LADL  tables  The  first  tables  were  constructed  around 
1970  long  before  comparable  lexicons  Gross  1975 
Some are now available on the web httpinfolinguuniv-
mlvfrenglish  follow  Linguistic  Resources  Intimately 
associated with the name of Maurice Gross they are an 
example of the originality creativity and fecundity of his 
scientific thought 
Firstly they are rich repositories of fact As compared to 
other  syntactico-semantic  lexicons  Lexicon-Grammar 
tables have three salient features 
-  senses  of  verbs  are  distinguished  and  represented  in 
separate lexical entries for example for John missed his 
daughter and John missed the target 
inside  a  verb  entry  different  constructions  are 
represented  for  example  John  missed  his  daughter  and 
Mary was missed by her father in that sense the tables 
contain the essential elements of a grammar  
-  the  number  of  entries  is  quite  comprehensive  eg 
15000 French verbs 
Secondly  these  tables  are  also  a  means  of  linguistic 
investigation  During  the  construction  they  are  an 
abundant source of discovery Once complete the tables 
are readable and constitute a tool for further research by 
the  international  community  of  linguists  including  for 
researchers that do not share the theoretical assumptions 
of their authors 
And they were designed as such This is an example of 
the  generosity  of  Maurice  Gross  He  also  used  to  pass 
ideas  on  to  students  and  colleagues  happy  when  they 
were developed in publications and never caring whether 
he was acknowledged as their originator 
The work completed under his supervision includes a set 
of  morpho-syntactic  lexicons  called  DELA  Courtois 
1990 2004 We illustrate this resource with a sentence 
automaton  which  is  automatically  derived  from  these 
lexicons  and  displays  the  lexical  tags  of  a  sequence  of 
words Fig 2 
12 Predicative nouns 
The analysis of sentences with a predicative noun and a 
support  verb  is  a  well-known  aspect  of  the  theory  of 
Zellig  Harris  and  Maurice  Gross  Harris  1957  Many 
nouns  can  function  as  sentence  predicates  playing  the 
same part as verbs like in 
Human language technologies have an increasing 
importance 
In  such  constructions  the  noun  is  accompanied  by  a 
support  verb  later  termed  light  verb  by  some  writers 
eg  Grimshaw  Mester  1988  The  importance  of 
predicative nouns for natural language processing comes 
from  the  fact  that  most  technical  nouns  are  predicative 
and that in technical texts many predicates are nouns  
Maurice  Gross  directed  studies  on  predicative  nouns  in 
French and other languages Large-scale results emerged 
in  the  1970s  Giry-Schneider  1978  and  generally 
validated the theory Nonetheless this theory was felt to 
be iconoclastic and faced fierce scientific opposition for 
years It eventually gained greater acceptance during the 
1990s4  Resistance  to  the  theory  did  not  influence  his 
opinion  because  Gross  was  aware  that  his  opponents 
arguments  did  not  stand  up  to  analysis  He  knew  better 
the  predicative 
nounssupport verbs model did not work 
Maurice Gross could be obstinate he liked contradiction 
and  his  critical  mind  was  developed  to  an  uncommon 
degree As regards the combination of wine with food  
a far weightier issue than predicative nouns  Maurice 
Gross  appreciated  some  red  wines  with  fish  and  some 
white  wines  with  cheese  and  he  enjoyed  demonstrating 
his  irritation  and  amusement  when  he  received  slighted 
remarks from wine waiters in classier restaurants 
they  did  which  details  of 
13 Compounds and idioms 
Gross set up a series of studies on compound lexical units 
eg Freckleton 1985 Machonis 1985 breaking with a 
long tradition that holds that such phrases are exceptions 
worth only of anecdotal remarks Compound lexical units 
are phrases described as lexical units Gross 1986a as 
Cell phones have antennas 
They can be defined by their lack of compositionality and 
the  distributional  frozenness  of  their  elements  The 
findings  showed  that  languages  have  a  large  number  of 
                                                      
4 The same can be said for predicative adjectives as in Human 
language technologies are increasingly important 
compound  predicates  such  as  make  ends  meet  and  that 
compound  entries  are  often  more  numerous  than  the 
simple-word  entries  for  the  same  part  of  speech  In 
French  for  instance  Maurice  Gross  indexed  26000 
verbal idioms5 Gross 1982 and 12000 adverbial idioms 
Gross 1986b 
He  devised  the  notion  of  local  grammars  Gross  1997 
for  semi-frozen  phrases  and  for  sequences  with  frozen 
behaviour  inside  a  specific  domain  like  cloudy  with 
sunny periods 
The term multi-word units Glass Hazen 1998 is more 
recent  It  groups  support-verb  constructions  compound 
lexical units semi-frozen phrases and collocations

14 Methodological legacy 
Maurice  Gross  contributed  centrally  to  the  construction 
of rigorous empirical methods for syntactic and semantic 
description  borrowing 
experimental  sciences  like  biology  and  physics  This  is 
probably  his  greatest  achievement  but  it  obviously 
accrued  still  further weight  from  his  parallel  descriptive 
work which showed that his methods were applicable to 
real  unrestricted  data  Historically  this  methodological 
work was part of the international movement in scientific 
formalised  linguistics  that  took  place  in  the  1960s  In 
1968  Maurice  Gross  also  contributed  to  the  foundation 
of  the  Linguistics  Department  of  the  University  of 
Vincennes and was the editor of Langages 9 a volume 
of  articles  by  major  contemporary  players  such  as 
Yehoshua  Bar-Hillel  Noam  Chomsky  Maurice  Gross 
Zellig Harris and Marcel-Paul Schtzenberger 
Resorting 
linguistic 
methodology may sound strange to many linguists even 
today but it is justified by the fact that the only possible 
source  of  knowledge 
empirical observation The central epistemological notion 
there  is  the  reproducibility  of  experiments  ie  that  the 
results  of  observation  should  not  depend  on 
observers  Obviously  the  objective  of  reproducibility  is 
particularly  difficult  to  attain  in  linguistics  In  addition 
any steps taken in order to ensure reproducibility should 
be  compatible  with  the  objective  of  actual  large-scale 
description  Maurice  Gross  advocated  a  subjective 
method with a collective control empirical observations 
are performed through introspection by a team of native-
speaker  linguists  This  is  how  the  Lexicon-Grammar 
tables of French verbs were constructed 
Some  argue  that  sufficient  reproducibility  can  only  be 
ensured  by  way  of  total  objectivity  However  whatever 
precautions can be taken in order to ensure the objectivity 
of  results  blind  experimentation  exclusive  resort  to 
attested  language  productions  they  are  in  practice 
incompatible  with 
large-scale  description  of  a 
language 
in  descriptive 
linguistics 
natural 
corpora 
exploitation 
information  provided 
Maurice  Gross  designed  and  implemented  a  set  of 
methods and tools for the manual elaboration of language 
resources of quality 
As compared to common practices in language resource 
construction  and  management  the  quality  of  resources 
constructed  with  these  methods  can  be  characterised  by 
four features 
-  Coverage  is  large  which  is  obtained  by  systematic 
browsing  of  segments  of  the  language  parts  of  speech 
for instance 
-  Representation  is  formal  eg  encoded  to  permit 
computational 
language 
processing purposes 
- Models for different languages are parallel 
- Information is particularly accurate since it is based on 
manual  analyses  of  introspective  or  attested  data  by 
trained  linguists  and  errors  are  corrected  directly  when 
discovered  In  resources  automatically  derived  from 
rules  or 
approximate  when  an  error  in  a resource is  discovered 
methods to correct it are not sure to be successful and can 
bring about further errors 
This  level  of  quality  is  obtained  as  said  through 
essentially  manual  construction  and  maintenance  This 
implies two additional features 
-  Resources  are  readable  to  a  high  degree  as  is 
exemplified  by  the  two  figures  above  the  relevant 
information  is  dense  when  necessary  as  in  the  second 
figure the display is graphical 
- The accumulation of resources is gradual thus allowing 
for  the  progressive  collaborative  construction  of  large 
resources from independent elements 
In the application of these methods Maurice Gross kept a 
watchful  eye  on  the  level  of  formalization  In  complete 
agreement  with  Zellig  Harriss  objective  of  a  formally 
minimal  theory6  he  was  very  keen  on  minimalism  in 
abstract  complexity  He  avoided  giving  new  names  to 
already named notions as computational linguists usually 
do7 He carefully avoided creating new abstract notions or 
models  or  building  complex  abstract  representations 
unless they were really useful For example the VP node 
in  syntactic  trees  is  useless  and  so  is  the  distinction 
between  PP  and  NP  nodes  the  presenceabsence  and 
lexical value of the preposition can perfectly be specified 
without  two  distinct  nodes  Such  nodes  introduce 
unnecessary  complexity  into  syntactic  trees  Fig  3 
whereas  the  complexity  of  the  phenomena  themselves 
calls for the simplest possible tools Fig 4

6  This  difference  between  Zellig  Harris  and  Noam  Chomsky 
shows even in their respective conceptions of transformations 
for Harris a transformation relates observable sentence forms 
for Chomsky it is a device to transform a deep structure into a 
surface structure

many writers that now they have to call syntax deep syntax

23 Finite-state processing 
Maurice  Grosss  approach  to  the  use  of  the  finite 
automaton  model 
for  NLP  was  pragmatic  and 
constructive  Soon  after  the  creation  of  this  model  the 
famous  article  by  Chomsky  1956  was  interpreted  as  a 
ban  on 
transgressions Woods 1970 Much later Maurice Gross 
1989a  gave  examples 
finite 
automaton  would  be  a  convenient  invaluable  tool  for 
syntactic description Groups related to the University of 
Helsinki and Rank Xerox were of the same opinion and 
it  came  to  be  one  of  the  most  popular  models  The 
RELEX  network  began  to  use  finite  automata  with  the 
graphical  editor  developed  by  Silberztein 
1993 
Empirical  studies  led  to  the  design  of  a  model  of 
lexicalised  syntactic  grammar  in  the  form  of  a  large 
network  of  finite  automata  or  recursive  transition

24 Rules vs idiosyncrasies 
I myself often heard that Maurice Gross was pessimistic 
because  he  did  not  have  confidence  in  rules  where 
language is concerned 
The  notions  of  rule  and  idiosyncrasy  are  symmetrical 
Rules  are  generic  statements  such  as  nouns  in  -s  are 
plural  whereas 
idiosyncrasies  are  particular  facts 
usually  about  lexical  items  such  as  beans  is  plural  or 
means  is  singular  Both  forms  can  express  formal 
knowledge which raises interesting issues when a rule is 
right what is the use of the corresponding idiosyncrasies 
and  vice  versa  should  language  resources  be  based  on 
rules or on idiosyncrasies 
In  practice  rules  tend  to  be  inaccurate  because  of  the 
ubiquity of chaotic behaviour and exceptions in language 
as  our  example  nouns  in  -s  are  plural  suggests  When 
we devise rules manually we have a natural tendency to 
over-estimate  their  predictive  power  when  they  are 
automatically  derived 
approximate When idiosyncratic data are available they 
are  more  often  accurate 
in  conformity  with 
observable reality 
On  the  other  hand  rules  can  be  automatically  inferred 
whereas  accounts  of  idiosyncratic  facts  have  to  be 
recorded  manually  a  work  which  obviously  requires 
time skill and effort and is therefore more costly 
In  this  trade-off  between  accuracy  and  cost  software 
engineers tend to prefer rules even if slightly inaccurate 
because  they  feel  that  rules  achieve  a  higher  level  of 
than  collections  of  particular  facts  In 
automation 
addition 
the  manual 
construction of language resources is difficult and often 
that  it  is  tedious  However  this  is  not  a  specialists 
opinion  since  they  seldom  have  the  opportunity  to 
engage  in  such  tasks  On  the  contrary  Maurice  Gross 
they  unanimously  say 
corpora 
results 
Fig 4 A simpler syntactic tree 
Fig 3 A syntactic tree with useless nodes 
This  position  was  consistent  with  his  own  character 
Pragmatic Maurice Gross liked simplicity and had good 
sense  He  was  not  easy  fooled  by  apparently  attractive 
and  brilliant  but  poor  ideas  He  was  delighted  by  the 
Sokal  1996  hoax  against  fashionable 
intellectual 
discourse 
22 Linguistics-based language processing 
Right from the beginning Maurice Gross was aware that 
formal descriptions of natural languages could be applied 
to  language  processing  The  first  opportunity  to  study 
linguistics  had  been  offered  to  him  in  the  1950s  in  a 
machine translation laboratory during the first period of 
enthusiasm  for  machine  translation  In  the  1960s  he 
founded  and  pioneered  the  concept  of  linguistics-based 
NLP  long  before  the  international  interest  for  language 
resources  In  this  approach  the  construction  of  NLP 
programs  is  based  on  language  resources  lexicons  and 
grammars  which  are  in  turn  based  on  descriptive 
linguistics He began to apply this concept in the 1960s 
and 1970s 
However  statistics-based  NLP  developed  and  became 
dominant  in  the  1980s  the  only  language  resources 
required  for  this  approach  to  NLP  are  corpora  While 
specialists  of  linguistics-based  NLP  were  developing 
their  methods  the  bulk  of  the  NLP  community  was 
discouraged by the difficulty and cost of such work but 
aware  that  language  resources  were  required  for  the 
fulfilment of their objectives This paradox was called the 
bottleneck  of  NLP  The 
international  academic 
community  eventually  got  an  interest  for  language 
resources but only in the 2000s 
In  spite  of  the  difficulty  and  cost  of  linguistics-based 
language  resources  Maurice  Gross 
construction  of 
such  discovery 
scientific  practice 
took  evident  pleasure  in  assembling  and  disassembling 
mechanisms of language 
Linguists are obviously interested in discovering rules In 
requires 
observing  facts  as  completely  as  possible  but  most 
linguists  do  not  check  large  numbers  of  idiosyncratic 
facts  and  they  never  say  explicitly  why  do  they  also 
consider studies on lexis as tedious or as a second-rate 
or  shameful  work  In  any  case  such  studies  have  been 
consistently neglected 
Back  to  the  1960s  when  Maurice  Gross  undertook  his 
work on lexis issues about rules and idiosyncrasies were 
being discussed among linguists Harris 1951 admitted 
the necessity of representing lexical restrictions We now 
have sets of morphemic components and residues so set 
that  as  nearly  as  possible  all  sequences  and 
combinations of them occur  It may not be convenient 
to represent by means of components such limitations of 
occurrence  among  morphemes  as  do  not  intersect  with 
other limitations involving the same morphemes or as do 
not lead to the division of a class into sub-classes clearly 
differentiated on that basis  This is frequently the case 
for morphemes classes which are grouped together into a 
general class on the basis of major similarities but which 
have small and unpatterned differences in distribution 
So did Chomsky 1962 There are in fact exceptions to 
many rules given above perhaps all These will have to 
be  separately 
listed  unless  some  more  general 
formulation  can  be  found  to  account  for  them  as  well 
  But  discovery  of  exceptions 
to  grammatical 
generalizations  is  of  no  consequence  in  itself  except 
when  it  leads  to  an  alternative  more  comprehensive 
generalization 
And  again  Chomsky  1965  Much  of  lexical  structure 
is in fact simply a classification induced by the system of 
phonological  and  syntactic  rules  Postal  has  suggested 
furthermore  that  there  should  be  a  general  lexical 
analysis of lexical items with respect to each rule R into 
those  which  must  those  which  may  and  those  which 
cannot be subject to R and has investigated some of the 
consequences  of 
there  remain 
possibilities  simply 
numerous  relatively  unexplored  ways  to  deal  with  the 
problems  that  arise  when  the  structure  of  a  lexicon  is 
considered seriously  For the present one can barely 
go beyond mere taxonomic arrangement of data Whether 
these  limitations  are  intrinsic  or  whether  a  deeper 
analysis  can  succeed  in  unraveling  some  of  these 
difficulties remains an open question 
But  none  of 
theoretical 
observations  to  the  empirical  description  of  a  language 
including its lexis 
Maurice  Gross  was 
to  consider  such  a 
programme as a priority to draw the consequences and to 
take up the challenge His Transformational Grammar of 
French 1968 1977 1986b is a scientific milestone As 
Amr Ibrahim 2002 puts it it clearly shows the limits of 
rule-based  formal  accounts  of  a  language  highlighting 
insurmountable  obstacles 
representation  of 
numerous  apparently 
insignificant  phenomena  even 
limited to the scope of simple sentence 
this  assumption  I  mention 
them  shifted  from  such 
indicate 
the  first 
insisting 
Zellig  Harriss  theory  was  a  sound  basis  for  such  a 
research  programme  and  he  supported  Maurice  Gross 
Meanwhile  Noam  Chomsky  was 
idiosyncratic  facts  were  not  worth  investigating  Gross 
1973  in  French  and  the  famous  1979  version  in 
English criticised the practices of generative grammar on 
these grounds 
Maurice  Gross  programme  is  ambitious  because  it 
requires  the  meticulousness  of  an  entomologist  but  he 
implemented it in a remarkably practical way because he 
had the wisdom to recognise priorities and leave the rest 
for  later  generations  For  example  restrictions  on  verb 
tenses are not represented in the present state of Lexicon-
Grammar tables of French 
Une rcompense est promise  Luc par Marie 
 A reward is being promised to Luke by Mary  
Une rcompense a t promise  Luc par Marie 
 A reward was promised to Luke by Mary  
Neither are productive pronominal constructions such as 
Une telle rcompense se promet facilement 
 Such a reward is easily promised  
Maurice  Gross  decision  to  launch  his  programme 
required  audacity  practicality  good 
sense  and  
intellectual  honesty  He  was  not  afraid  of  data  He 
probably described the situation calmly in such terms as 
One  has  to  study  all  sentence  types  and  all  types  of 
verbs  Well  lets  see  what  we  find  This  indicates  his 
ability to go to the heart of a problem with precision and 
lucidity  and  to  express  his  conclusions  with  a  brutality 
and provocation that gave him some Voltairian sense of 
humour 
He exercised the same humour in his ferocious comments 
on  scientific  adversaries  with  no  regard  for  political 
correctness  and  through  a  collection  of  favoured  put-
downs  such  as  They  are  all  illiterates  Hes  lightly 
mentally  handicapped  Hes  a  sick  man  Their 
arrogance is equalled only by their incompetence and so 
25 Corpora vs lexicons and grammars 
In  the  currently  dominant  model  of  NLP  more  or  less 
language-independent  programs  infer  information  on 
input text from rules acquired by frequency-based corpus 
processing 
In practical terms the extensive use of this model makes 
language  resource  management  cheaper  The  corpora 
used  by  the  worlds  programs  make  up  a  largely  stable 
set  operations  to  enhance  or  extend  them  or  to  create 
new ones are much less frequent than operations making 
use of them In addition constructing corpora and even 
tagged corpora is a smaller investment than constructing 
lexicons and grammars The information in state-of-the-
art tagged corpora is less complete than the information 
in  state-of-the-art  lexicons  and  grammars  Coverage  of 
lexical  elements  is  poorer Structural  complexity  is  kept 
smaller  because  of  the  computational  limitations  of 
frequency-based  inference  programs  The  annotation  of 
multi-word units eg make ends meet is poorer Sense 
distinctions eg between John missed his daughter and 
statistics-based  programs 
John  missed  the  target  are  not  made  Indirectly  this 
policy  limits  the  number  of  linguists  to  be  educated  by 
universities and hired by companies 
But  the  price  to  be  paid  for  this  limitation  of  costs  is  a 
lower  quality  of  product  Maurice  Gross  worked  much 
more  on  lexicons  and  grammars  than  on  corpora 
Inference-based  or 
compensate  for  part  of  the  difference  of  information 
content  but  cannot  compete  with  manually  constructed 
lexicons  and  grammars  because 
the  automatically 
inferred information is only approximate 
There  are  two  alternative  approaches  linguistics-based 
processing making use of manually constructed lexicons 
and  grammars  and  hybrid  processing  In  the  present 
situation  they  are  perceived  as  factors  of  quality  and 
progress  as  is  illustrated  by  the  increasing  use  of 
compound-word 
lexicons  by 
language  engineering 
companies and search engines 
This  debate  is  connected  to  the  controversy  between 
corpus linguistics and introspective linguistics 
Introspective  linguists  use  introspection  a  subjective 
human  faculty  as  one  of  the  sources  of  linguistic 
knowledge  Corpus  linguists  in  contrast  are  usually 
antipathetic  to  the  use  of  introspective  data  Some  of 
them  use  the  term  armchair  linguistics  to  suggest  that 
introspective  linguistics  fails  to  deal  with  the  reality  of 
language and that this reality is accessible only through 
attested 
linguistic  productions  However  negative 
information such as the inacceptability of some linguistic 
forms  is  also  an  aspect  of  the  reality  of  languages 
whereas  it  is  accessible  only  through  introspection  and 
not  through  corpus  exploration  In  addition  there  is  no 
example  of  a  large-coverage  formalized  lexicon  or 
grammar constructed on the basis of corpus linguistics 
Maurice Gross was not opposed to the use of corpora but 
his practice evolved with time He began to use corpora 
only  when  a  professional  tool  Silberztein  1993  was 
available to explore them And this tool was based on the 
lexicons  constructed  under  his  supervision  In  fact  no 
work  is  more  inadequately  described  by  the  term 
armchair linguistics than his  
His  position  on  the  respective  potential  of  corpora 
lexicons and grammars conflicted both with the statistics-
based  approach  to  NLP  and  with  the  positions  of  strict 
corpus  linguists  Among  the  reasons  why  his  scientific 
arguments could not persuade them we find a number of 
extra-scientific  reasons  and  in  particular  sociological 
explanations The opposition between statistics-based and 
linguistics-based NLP is founded on the division between 
engineers  and  linguists  a  very  strong  cultural  gap  and 
the  opposition  between 
introspective  and  corpus 
linguistics had many features of a generation gap Human 
factors like these can have such a power on peoples and 
even  scholars  minds  that  they  can  prevent  them  from 
accepting perfectly rational argument As an independent 
thinker  Gross  was  not  impressed  by  a  consensus  based 
partly on non-scientific reasoning 
This  particular  personal  trait  showed  in  the  way  he 
educated his students When he talked with them  and 
he invested a lot of time in the education of some of them 
 he focused on scientific matters leaving them to find 
themselves  training  in  more  mundane  skills  or  political 
strategies 
26 A few scientific fashions 
Needless to say Maurice Gross did not make concessions 
to  unjustified  scientific  fads  and  fashions  His  positions 
indicate a remarkably long-term view and intuition Here 
are  three  examples  of  scientific  fashions  he  struggled 
against with solid scientific arguments on his side 
261 Machine translation without a lexicon 
Not  only  did  Maurice  Gross  1972  insist  that  lexicons 
are  required  for  machine  translation  but  also  that  the 
lexicon  is  the  first  element  that  should  be  constructed 
because  virtually  all  other  components  depend  on  it 
Machine translation is now regularly taken as an example 
of  a  field  that  requires  lexicons  The  modern  notion  of 
translation  memories  is  just  a  variant  of  the  notion  of 
lexicon 
called  machine-readable 
262 Deriving lexicons from conventional dictionaries 
The idea of deriving lexical resources from conventional 
dictionaries 
dictionaries 
MRDs  became  amazingly  popular  in  the  end  of  the 
1980s It appeared as an alternative to the costly task of 
manually  constructing  lexical  resources  Maurice  Gross 
1989b denounced this trend as an illusion and a wrong 
answer  to  a  real  problem  showing  that  information  is 
much  less  formal  and  systematic  in  dictionaries  written 
for human readers than in the resources required for NLP 
This prediction was confirmed years later the results of 
these researches were disappointing Ide Vronis 1993 
lemma  excluded 
263 Small tagsets 
The  most  commonly  used  tagsets  are  small  they  have 
between  15  to  100  tags  which  is  what  is  needed  to 
encode  morpho-syntax 
in  many 
languages  The  most  basic  operations  on  tags  are  word 
annotation  assigning  tags  to  words  and  ambiguity 
resolution  removing  wrong  tags  The  latter  problem  is 
far  more  challenging  than  the  former  Both  depend 
heavily on the size of the tagset 
Maurice  Gross  used  to  warn  that  larger  tagsets  are 
required  for  handling  lemmata  or  syntactico-semantic 
information However since the 1990s most of the field 
seems to have considered that one should keep on using 
small  tagsets  as  long  as  technology  to  solve  lexical 
ambiguity is not available This view aims at limiting the 
complexity  of  tagged  text  which  is  used  as  input  for 
further  operations  But 
investigation  of  approaches  to  annotation  as  well  as 
approaches to ambiguity removal 
International interest for larger tagsets has progressively 
increased during the last 5 years 
it  also  severely 
limits 
264 Comment 
Superficial  scientific  fashions  appear  from  time  to  time 
and  can  endure  even  though  not  always  a  sign  of 
progress  They  may  lead  research  in  wrong  directions 
and  thus  cause  waste  This  is  likely  because  research 
outcomes are not known beforehand But it is interesting 
to notice cases where failure could have been avoided by 
paying attention to scientific arguments presented by an 
outstanding scholar 
The current mechanisms of scientific democracy and in 
particular  peer  review  regulate  research  agendas  and 
undoubtedly represent progress but they cannot prevent 
undesirable 
these  checks  and  balances 
developed  progressively  during  the  career  of  Maurice 
Gross  and were  quite  well  installed  even  20  years  ago 
but  they  failed  to  prevent  short-sighted  views  from 
invading the field for years after 
fashions 
3 Institutional legacy 
In addition to his works Maurice Grosss legacy includes 
an  enduring  research  infrastructure  made  up  of  the 
following elements 
-  an  informal  network  of  specialists  of  linguistics-based 
language resources RELEX 
-  a  series  of  International  Conferences  on  Lexis  and 
Grammar  held  since  1981  Liverpool  2005  Palermo 
2006 
-  an  international  journal  with  a  selection  committee 
Lingvistic Investigationes published by Benjamins 
- a model and a format for lexical resources implemented 
in  numerous  languages  the  DELA  format  Courtois 
1990 The model the format and the resources were the 
main  source  of  inspiration  for  the  development  of 
standards in lexical resources by the Genelex project and 
indirectly for later standards 
Conclusion 
Through  the  originality  of  his  legacy  and  his  long-term 
vision Maurice Gross is an impressive scientist Most of 
his innovations even those dating back to the 1960s and 
1970s  are  now  becoming  increasingly  accepted  by  the 
scientific community around the world It is all the more 
interesting to notice how much and for how long they met 
with resistance when he first expressed them 
Maurice Gross is worth reading now and for some time to 
come His work is more innovative than that presented at 
many  high-profile  conferences  and  journals  this  year 
And it will be so next year
