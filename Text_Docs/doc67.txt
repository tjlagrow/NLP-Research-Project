1 Introduction
Globular clusters are among the oldest objects in galaxies and understanding
the details of their formation and evolution can bring valuable insight into the
early history of galaxies Until the late 1970s globular clusters were thought
of to be relatively static stellar systems a view which was supported by the
fact that most observed density proles of globular clusters can be tted
with equilibrium models like eg King 1966 proles This view has changed
signicantly over the last twenty years On the observational side the evidence
for dierences in the stellar mass-functions of globular clusters Piotto Cool
 King 1997 de Marchi et al 1999 which are believed to be at least partly
the result of their dynamical evolution and the discovery of extratidal stars
surrounding globular clusters Grillmair et al 1995 Odenkirchen et al 2003
are strong indications for the ongoing dynamical evolution and dissolution of
globular clusters
On the theoretical side N -body simulations of star cluster evolution have
become increasingly sophisticated due to both progresses in simulation tech-
niques eg Mikkola  Aarseth 1993 Aarseth 1999 and the development
of the GRAPE series of special purpose computers Sugimoto et al 1990
Makino et al 2003 which allows to simulate the evolution of star clusters
with increasingly larger particle numbers
This review summarises the current knowledge about the dissolution of
star clusters and discusses the implications of star cluster dissolution for the
evolution of the mass function of star cluster systems in galaxies
2 Dissolution mechanisms
Star clusters evolve due to a number of dissolution mechanisms the most
important of which are

4 External tidal perturbations
The importance of the dierent processes changes as a star cluster ages and
depends also on the position of the cluster in its parent galaxy The combined
eect of all dissolution mechanisms can dramatically alter the properties of
star cluster systems so it is important to understand them
21 Primordial gas loss
Star formation is typically less than 40 ecient and the gas not turned into
stars is lost within a few 105 to 106 Myrs due to stellar winds from massive
stars or supernova explosions N -body simulations have shown that the loss
of the primordial gas can easily cause star clusters to lose a large fraction
of their stars Goodwin 1997 Kroupa et al 2001 Boily  Kroupa 2003 or
unbind them completely Together with the loss of a large mass fraction within
a short timescale star clusters also undergo signicant expansion Connected
to the problem of primordial gas loss is the question whether star clusters form
in virial equilibrium since in addition to gravity molecular clouds are also
held together by magnetic elds and the pressure from the ambient gaseous
medium Since these forces do not act on stars some clusters might already
be unbound at birth and disperse within a few crossing times As a result
a signicant fraction of clusters might not survive the rst 10 Myrs infant
mortality problem Lada  Lada 2003
These considerations are supported by observations which show that a
large fraction of clusters dissolve at an early stage Fall et al 2005 for ex-
ample found that in the Antennae galaxies the number of clusters decreases
strongly with cluster age and that the median age of clusters is only 107 yrs
which they interpreted as evidence for rapid cluster disruption Similarly only
a small fraction of star-forming embedded clusters in the Milky Way evolve
to become open clusters Lada  Lada 2003 implying that the majority of
clusters must dissolve within a few Myrs
22 Stellar evolution
For clusters which survive the early evolutionary stages the next dissolution
mechanism is stellar evolution For a standard stellar IMF like for example
the Kroupa 2001 IMF about 30 of the mass of a star cluster is lost due
to the stellar evolution of the member stars within a few Gyrs Baumgardt
 Makino 2003 and the fraction can be signicantly higher for star clusters
starting with a top-heavy IMF Mass-loss from stellar evolution causes the
clusters to expand while at the same time decreasing the tidal radius of star
clusters Although the eect is less strong than the loss of the primordial gas

Fig 1 Dissolution of isolated clusters starting with dierent initial particle numbers
N  Irrespective of N  complete dissolution takes about 1015 N -body times since
relaxation causes a strong cluster expansion which slows down the overall evolution
from Baumgardt et al 2002
since the mass loss happens on a longer timescale N -body simulations have
shown that the eect is strong enough to unbind low-concentration clusters
surrounded by an external tidal eld
Fukushige  Heggie 1995 for example found that if the stellar IMF fol-
lows a power-law with index   15 between 04  m  15 M clusters
less concentrated than King W0  7 models were easily disrupted by stel-
lar evolution mass-loss For Salpeter-like IMFs clusters had to have an initial
concentration W0  5 to be stable against disruption Similar results were also
found by Giersz 2001 and Joshii et al 2001 in Monte-Carlo simulations
23 Relaxation
Relaxation arises due to mutual encounters between stars in a globular cluster
and causes a slow drift of stars in energy space Dynamical processes like the
segregation of heavy mass stars into the cluster center or the core collapse of
star clusters are driven by relaxation For a star cluster containing N stars
with mean mass  m  and half-mass radius rh the relaxation time at rh is
given by Spitzer 1987 eq 2-63

Fig 2 Escape of stars from clusters in circular orbits Bound members are scattered
on relaxation time scales to become potential escapers with E  EC Potential
escapers either escape or lose energy and become bound members again
where G is the constant of gravity and  the Coulomb logarithm
Due to mutual encounters between cluster stars stars can also gain enough
energy to leave the cluster completely which causes a slow evaporation of the
whole cluster N -body simulations Baumgardt et al 2002 and Fig 1 have
shown that for isolated clusters this process is inecient in dissolving star
clusters since even low-mass clusters would need of order 1015 initial crossing
times to completely evaporate ie they would not dissolve within the lifetime
of the universe The reason is that relaxation is dominated by the cumulative
eect of many distant encounters so stars change their energies smoothly
and do not jump around in energy space As the energy of a star approaches
E  0 it inevitably moves through the outskirts of the cluster for most of
the time where the stellar density is low and the star has only few encounters
with other stars As a result relaxation alone causes clusters to expand but
does not dissolve them
24 External tidal elds
Star clusters are usually not isolated but move in the gravitational eld of
their parent galaxy The external galaxy can inuence the evolution of a star
cluster in two ways A constant tidal eld which arises for example if clusters
move on circular orbits through axisymmetric potentials connes the cluster
stars into a certain volume around the cluster centre outside of which the stars
are unbound to the cluster This prevents clusters from expanding indenitely
and accelerates the escape of stars since the energy necessary to escape from
the cluster is lowered
Variable external elds arise if clusters move on elliptic orbits or through
a galactic disc In the rst case they experience disruptive tidal shocks since
stars are accelerated away from the cluster centre in the latter case the shocks
are compressive In both cases the internal energy of the clusters is increased
For star clusters moving in circular orbits stars with an energy E only
slightly higher than the critical energy EC needed for escape can escape only
through small apertures around the lagrangian points L1 and L2 connecting
the centre of the galaxy with the centre of the star cluster Fukushige  Heggie
Dissolution of Globular Clusters
1997 have shown that this leads to a scaling of the average time needed to
escape according to TEsc  1E  EC 2 ie for small energy dierences the
escape time can become of the order of the relaxation time or even larger
This leads to a complication of the whole escape process as illustrated in Fig
2 Bound members are scattered on a relaxation time to become potential
escapers with E  EC  Potential escapers can either escape or are scattered
to lower energies and become bound members again
Baumgardt 2001 has shown that this inuences the scaling of the life-
times of star clusters with the number of cluster stars or the total mass While
the lifetimes of single-mass clusters surrounded with a tidal boundary scale
with the relaxation time clusters moving in circular orbits through their par-
ent galaxy show a scaling of their lifetimes according to T 075
rh  If lifetimes of
star clusters are estimated by scaling the results of low-N models to higher
particle numbers this causes a reduction of the lifetimes of globular clusters
by a factor of a few Interestingly a similar slow increase of the lifetime of
star clusters with the particle number was also found in observational studies
of open cluster systems Boutloukos  Lamers 2003 Lamers et al 2005
3 Evolution of realistic clusters
Since the pioneering study by Cherno  Weinberg 1990 a number of pa-
pers have studied the evolution of multi-mass star clusters evolving under the
combined eects of stellar evolution relaxation and an external tidal eld
eg Gnedin  Ostriker 1997 Vesperini  Heggie 1997 Kroupa Aarseth 
Hurley 2001 In the following I will concentrate on the results of Baumgardt
 Makino 2003 who have so far performed the largest set of N -body cal-
culations of the evolution of multi-mass star clusters in external tidal elds
Their clusters all started with Kroupa 2001 IMFs but varying initial particle
numbers orbital types and density proles
Fig 3 summarises their results for the dissolution times Independent of
orbital type and initial cluster concentration the lifetimes always scaled with
the relaxation time as T x
rh where x  07 Clusters starting from King models
with a larger central concentration open circles show a slightly steeper scal-
ing of the lifetimes Interestingly the exponent does not change if one goes
from circular to elliptic orbits triangles indicating that although tidal shocks
help in removing stars the general picture of stellar escape is not changed sig-
nicantly Star clusters moving at smaller galactocentric distances RG have
smaller lifetimes since the tidal eld is stronger and connes the clusters to
smaller volumes Baumgardt  Makino 2003 summarised their results for
the lifetimes with the following formula

Fig 3 Lifetimes of star clusters in dependence of their mass for clusters moving
in dierent orbits and starting from dierent initial King models In all cases the
lifetimes show a scaling with the mass close to TDiss  M 075
where   191   002 and x  075 are constants VG is the circular
velocity of the external galaxy and  the orbital eccentricity of the cluster This
formula did t the N -body results for star clusters surviving for a Hubble time
to within 10 It slightly overpredicted the lifetimes of star clusters dissolving
in less than 1 Gyr since such clusters contain massive stars for a larger fraction
of their lifetime which reduces their relaxation times
4 Evolution of globular cluster systems
The globular cluster system of the Milky Way as we observe it today is
characterised by a Gaussian distribution in absolute magnitudes with mean
MV  74 and scatter M  115 similar to what is observed for glob-
ular clusters in other galaxies In contrast young massive clusters in in-
teracting and starburst galaxies follow power-law distributions over mass
N M   M  with slopes close to   2 so the question arises whether
Dissolution of Globular Clusters
Fig 4 Evolution of the mass function of galactic globular clusters for inner RG 
10 kpc left panel and and outer 20 kpc RG  40 kpc right panel clusters While
inside 10 kpc power-law IMFs can be turned into gaussians the mass-function of
outer clusters is increasing towards the lowest masses and is in contradiction with
the observed MF
the globular cluster system of the Milky Way started with a similar mass-
function and has lost the low-mass clusters due to dissolution Stars lost from
these clusters could nowadays form the halo eld stars
In order to study this question I have performed a number of Monte-Carlo
simulations in which clusters were assumed to start with a power-law IMF N 
M 
C with power-law index   20 and followed a radial distribution in the
galaxy according to   R
G with   45 and core radius RC  1 kpc The
galaxy was modelled as an isothermal sphere with a circular velocity of VG 
200 kmsec and the cluster system was set-up such that the clusters had an
isotropic velocity dispersion at all radii The lifetimes derived by Baumgardt
 Makino 2003 and given in eq 2 were used to dissolve clusters
In addition to the dissolution mechanisms already considered by Baum-
gardt  Makino 2003 the simulations also included dynamical friction and
disc shocks Dynamical friction was modeled as a steady shrinking of the clus-
ter orbit according to eq 7-25 of Binney  Tremaine 1987 while disc shocks
were included according to Spitzer  Chevalier 1973 assuming that a frac-
tional increase of the cluster energy by EEC corresponds to a fractional
mass loss of the same amount
Fig 4 shows the resulting evolution of the mass function of the galactic
globular cluster system Inside RG  10 kpc the dissolution mechanisms
are strong enough to evolve an initial power-law MF into a bell-shaped MF
The mean and dispersion of the surviving clusters agree rather well with
the observed MF of galactic globular clusters The situation changes if one
considers clusters at larger galactocentric radii For outer clusters the tidal

eld is much weaker meaning less destruction of the cluster system As a
result the MF of surviving clusters is still increasing towards the lowest masses
considered in contrast with what is observed for the galactic globulars This
agrees qualitatively with results derived by Vesperini 1998 and Parmentier
 Gilmore 2005 but is in contrast to what Fall  Zhang 2001 found for the
outer clusters Further research is necessary to constrain the starting condition
of the galactic GC system
