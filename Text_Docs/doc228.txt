ABSTRACT
We present the most accurate measurement to date of cosmological evolution of the
near-infrared galaxy luminosity function from the local Universe out to z  4 The
analysis is based on a large and highly complete sample of galaxies selected from the
rst data release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Exploiting a master catalogue of
K- and z-band selected galaxies over an area of 07 square degrees we analyse a sample
of  50 000 galaxies all with reliable photometry in 16-bands from the far-ultraviolet
to the mid-infrared The unique combination of large area and depth provided by the
Ultra Deep Survey allows us to trace the evolution of the K-band luminosity func-
tion with unprecedented accuracy In particular via a maximum likelihood analysis
we obtain a simple parameterization for the luminosity function and its cosmological
evolution including both luminosity and density evolution which provides an excel-
lent description of the data from z  0 up to z  4 We nd dierential evolution
for galaxies dependent on galaxy luminosity revealing once again the down-sizing
behaviour of galaxy formation Finally we compare our results with the predictions
of the latest theoretical models of galaxy formation based both on semi-analytical
prescriptions and on full hydrodynamical simulations
Key words galaxies evolution - galaxies formation - cosmology observations
INTRODUCTION
In recent years outstanding progress has been made in un-
derstanding the structure and the evolution of the Uni-
verse In particular the canonical Lambda cold dark matter
CDM cosmological model now provides a solid frame-
work and is able to explain a large variety of observations
from the uctuations in the cosmic microwave background
radiation CMB to the large scale structure of the Universe
eg Perlmutter et al 1998 Riess et al 1998 Tegmark et al
2004 Spergel et al 2003 2007 Moreover the CDM model
also provides a clear picture for the composition of the Uni-
verse with baryonic matter contributing only  4 to the
density and the Universe being dominated by dark energy
and dark matter Over the last fteen years enormous im-
provements in numerical N-body simulations have allowed
 Scottish Universities Physics Alliance
the hierarchical growth of the dark matter DM to be ac-
curately traced from the initial perturbations to the large
scale structure we see in the local Universe eg see Springel
et al 2005 However while the evolution of the DM is now
well understood understanding the physics involved in the
evolution of the baryons is much more complex While the
evolution of the DM is only subject to gravity many other
physical processes must be taken into account to describe
the formation and evolution of galaxies eg gas cooling
star-formation production of dust and metals and feedback
from supernovae and nuclear black holes
Various theoretical models have been developed either
by implementing semi-analytical prescriptions for the trans-
formation of gas into stars on the DM merger tree eg
Kaumann et al 1993 Cole et al 2000 Somerville et al
2001 or by solving a full set of hydrodynamical equations for
the DM and baryons with smooth particle hydrodynamics
SPH simulations eg Nagamine et al 2000 2001 Springel
2 M Cirasuolo et al
 Hernquist 2003 Over the last decade these theoretical
models have become increasingly successful in some regards
in explaining the observed properties of galaxies in the lo-
cal Universe Traditionally however most semi-analytical
models have demonstrated a tendency to predict very few

oldmassive galaxies at high redshift z 
hierarchical growth of DM large structures naturally form
late by continuous merging of smaller haloes eg Cole et
al 2000 Menci et al 2002 However this hierarchical be-
haviour seems to be in contrast with recent observational
results with the advent of recent near-infrared surveys in
particular revealing the presence of a substantial population
of old massive evolved galaxies Extremely Red Objects
 15 which were previously
Distant Red Galaxies at z 
missed by optical surveys Cimatti et al 2002 Daddi et al
Several deep multi-wavelengths surveys are now ongoing
or have just been completed Cimatti et al 2002 Giavalisco
et al 2004 Rix et al 2004 Lawrence et al 2007 Scoville
et al 2007 with the aim of tracing the assembly history of
galaxies Exploiting the near-infrared data and supported
by spectroscopic and photometric redshift estimations sev-
eral studies have attempted to derive the evolution of the
near-infrared luminosity function LF as a tracer of the
mass assembly history of galaxies In fact it has long been
understood that observations of the rest-frame near-infrared
emission of galaxies is the best tracer of the stellar mass be-
cause it is less aected by dust absorption and ongoing star-
formation eg Lilly  Longair 1984 Dunlop et al 1989
Glazebrook et al 1995 Cowie et al 1996 Poggianti 1997 
Several authors have found evidence for evolution of the
near-infrared LF with redshift with the evolution being very
slow from the local Universe up to z  05 and then pro-
gressively faster Glazebrook et al 1995 Bolzonella et al
2002 Pozzetti et al 2003 Dickinson et al 2003 Drory et al
2003 Caputi et al 2006 Saracco et al 2006 However as
shown by Saracco et al there are still some discrepancies
between results obtained by dierent authors especially at
the bright end presumably due to the small-number statis-
tics imposed by the limited areal coverage of the available
data Recently the advent of the Spitzer satellite has pro-
vided the opportunity to derive reliable estimates for the
stellar masses in galaxies at high redshift allowing a direct
study of the evolution of the mass function Fontana 2004
2006 Drory et al 2005 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 Pozzetti
et al 2007 These studies have consolidated the downsiz-
ing scenario Cowie et al 1996 in which the more massive
galaxies form their stars at higher redshift and on a shorter
time scale compared to less massive systems
From the theoretical point of view this apparent dis-
crepancy between the hierarchical growth of DM and the
downsizing evolution observed in galaxies seems to be rec-
onciled in the latest models by properly taking into account
both stellar and nuclear feedback Granato et al 2001 2004
Cirasuolo et al 2005 Di Matteo et al 2005 Croton et al
2006 Bower et al 2006 Menci et al 2006 Monaco et al
The aim of this work is to obtain an extremely accu-
rate determination of the cosmological evolution of the near-
infrared galaxy LF which can then be wielded as a powerful
tool to constrain and possibly discriminate between the var-
ious prescriptions for the physical mechanisms implemented
in galaxy-formation models
The layout of the paper is as follows In Section 2 we
summarize the main properties of the datasets used in this
work and in Section 3 we describe in detail the method
we have developed for the estimation of redshifts from the
available multi-band photometry In Section 4 we derive the
near-infrared LF and its cosmological evolution comparing
it with previous results found in literature Finally in Sec-
tion 5 we compare our results with the predictions of some
of the latest models of galaxy formation Our conclusions
are presented in Section 6

2 THE DATA-SETS
The aim of this paper is to analyse the evolutionary proper-
ties of galaxies by exploiting the Ultra Deep Survey UDS
the deepest of the ve surveys that constitute the UKIRT
Infrared Deep Sky Survey UKIDSS - Lawrence et al 2007
For the purpose of this work we used data from the rst
data release of the survey DR1 Warren et al 2007 which
includes imaging in the J- and K-bands with 5 depths of
233 and 231 respectively within a 3-arcsec diameter aper-
ture Crucially the UDS eld benets from a large area 08
square degrees and deep multi-wavelength coverage For
this work we primarily exploit the deep optical data from the
Subaru XMM-Newton Deep Survey SXDS Sekiguchi et al
2005 Furusawa et al 2008 which covers most of the UDS
eld in BV Riz lters to typical 5 depths of B  275
V  267 R  270 i  268 and z  259 within a
3-arcsec diameter aperture
For the construction of the initial galaxy catalogue we
performed source extraction on the K-band mosaic by using
the public code sextractor Bertin  Arnout 1996 The
number counts for the K-band selected sources are shown in
Fig 1 and compared with previous estimates found in the lit-
erature In order to improve the completeness of our sample
at faint magnitudes we also performed source extraction on
the z-band images from the SXDS The advantage of doing
this is that the z-band images are  25 magnitudes deeper
than the DR1 K-band data in the UDS Therefore perform-
ing aperture photometry on the K-band images centered at
the position of the z-band extracted sources allowed us to
increase the completeness close to the K-band ux limit at
least for sources which do not have extremely red colours
eg z  K  2
This technique allowed us to build a master-catalogue
including all the sources extracted directly from the K-band
images plus all the sources selected in the z-band with a
counterpart in the K-band mosaic The number counts for
sources in the master-catalogue K  z selected are shown
in Fig 1 with lled dots As can be seen from Fig 1 the
procedure of selecting sources in both the K- and z-bands
has increased the completeness of the sample to  100 at
K  23
To fully exploit the high completeness of our sample
for the purpose of this work we only considered sources in
position of the K  z-selected sources within a 3-diameter
aperture Since the mean FWHM of the IRAC PSF at 36m
is 166 arcsec Fazio et al 2004 the magnitudes required
aperture correcting to match the total magnitudes We per-
formed tests studying the curve of growth of isolated stars
in the eld and derived aperture corrections of 053 and 058
magnitudes for the 36m and 45m channels respectively
in agreement with Surace et al 2005
At shorter wavelengths the available multi-wavelength
data in the UDS has recently been complemented by obser-
vations in the ultraviolet obtained with the GALEX satellite
both FUV and NUV channels Given the large FWHM of
the GALEX PSF 6 we used the total magnitudes given
in the GALEX archive catalogues2 and matched sources by
using a searching radius of 2 arcsec
Star-galaxy separation has been performed by com-
bining information from the stellarity parameter as mea-
sured by SExtractor on the SXDS images with the position
of the sources in the BzK colour-colour diagram Daddi
et al 2004 As pointed out by Daddi et al stars have
colours that are clearly separated from the region occupied
by galaxies and can be eciently isolated with the crite-
rion z  K  03B  z  05 It is worth noting that the
vast majority of these sources classied as stars also show
an unacceptable value of the 2 when tted with galaxy
templates
To summarise the master-catalogue of sources we used
for this work has been selected by using both the UKIRT
WFCAM K-band and Subaru SuprimeCam z-band images
in the UDS eld For the following analysis we consider
50000 sources with K  23 over an area of 07 square
degrees with each source having reliable photometry de-
tections or upper-limits in 16 broad-bands from the far-
ultraviolet to 45m
3 REDSHIFT DETERMINATION
The extensive and deep multi-wavelength information in the
UDS eld is vital for detailed modelling of the galaxy spec-
tral energy distributions SEDs Following Cirasuolo et al
2007 we derived photometric redshifts for all the sources
in the K  z master catalogue by tting the observed pho-
tometry with both empirical and synthetic galaxy templates
31 Photometric redshifts
The tting procedure to derive photometric redshifts based
on 2 minimization was performed with a code based
largely on the public package Hyperz Bolzonella Miralles 
Pello 2000 As empirical templates we used both the aver-
age local galaxies SEDs derived by Coleman Wu and Weed-
man CWW and the more recent templates obtained within
the K20 survey Cimatti et al 2002 Mignoli et al 2005 In
order to improve the characterization of young blue galaxies
we also implemented six SEDs of observed starbursts from
Kinney et al 1996
To generate synthetic templates of galaxies we used
Figure 1 Number counts in the K-band for sources in the UDS
eld The K-band selected solid squares and K  z selected
lled dots samples are described in the text For comparison
we also show the number counts in the K-band from Saracco et
al 2001 open circles Gardner et al 1993 crosses Bershady
et al 1998 stars Moustakas et al 1997 lled triangles and
McLeod et al 1995 open triangles
the master-catalogue with K  23 and limit the analysis
to an area of 07 square degrees which is covered by both
the UDS and SXDS imaging In order to model the spectral
energy distribution SED of these sources we performed
aperture photometry on the BV RizJK images centered
at the position of the K  z selected sources The optical
and near-infrared photometry were measured in 3 diameter
apertures and then point spread function PSF corrected
to total magnitudes The consistent image quality of the op-
tical and near-infrared data with Full Width Half Maximum
FWHM in the range 075  FWHM  080 arcsec means
that the dierential aperture corrections between bands are
small  01 mag
The UDS eld also benets from optical data obtained
with the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope CFHT as part
of the CFHT Legacy Survey Source catalogues in u g r i z
bands from the TERAPIX release 3 T0003 were retrieved
from the CHFT legacy survey website1 and matched with
the sources in the master catalogue by using a searching
radius of 1 arcsec The typical 5 depths for the CFHT data
mag auto are u  253 g  252 r  247 i  244 and
z  225
Extremely valuable coverage of the UDS at mid-infrared
wavelengths is provided by the Spitzer satellite as part of
the Spitzer wide-area infrared extragalactic SWIRE sur-
vey Lonsdale et al 2003 2004 For the present study we
exploited the IRAC data at 36m and 45m presented in
the second data release Surace et al 2005 We performed
aperture photometry on the IRAC images centered at the

the stellar population synthesis models of Bruzual  Char-
lot 2003 assuming a Salpeter initial mass function IMF
with a lower and upper mass cuto of 01 and 100 M
respectively We used a variety of star-formation histories
instantaneous-burst and exponentially-declining star forma-
tion with e-folding times 03   Gyr  15 all with a xed
solar metallicity Dust reddening was taken into account by
following the obscuration law of Calzetti et al 2000 within
the range 0  AV  2 We also added a prescription for the
Lyman series absorption due to the HI clouds in the in-
ter galactic medium according to Madau 1995 Finally
at each redshift we only permitted models with an age less
than the age of the Universe at that redshift
32 Spectroscopic redshifts
The UDS also benets from various large spectroscopic cam-
paigns that allow us to test the reliability of our redshift es-
timations Fig 2 shows the comparison of our photometric
redshifts estimates for  1200 galaxies in the UDS eld with
secure spectroscopic redshifts Yamada et al 2005 Akiyama
et al in preparation Smail et al in preparation Simpson et
al 2006a The agreement is remarkably good over the full
redshift range 0  z  6 The fraction of outliers dened as
sources with z1  z  zspect  zphot1  zspect 
015 is extremely low less than 2 The improvement com-
pared with our previous work Cirasuolo et al 2007 is
mainly due to the added value of the u-band and Galex data
which signicantly helps to remove the degeneracy between
double minima in redshift space
More quantitatively the accuracy of our photometric
redshifts can be estimated by looking at the distribution of
the z1  z as shown in the small inset in Fig 2 The
distribution has a mean consistent with zero 0008 and a
standard deviation   0034 excluding the few outliers
with z1  z  015 This accuracy is comparable to
the best available from other surveys such as GOODS and
COSMOS Caputi et al 2006 Grazian et al 2006 Mobasher
et al 2007 As already pointed out in our previous work
Cirasuolo et al 2007 this accuracy is preserved down to
faint K-band magnitudes K  22 and up to very high red-
shifts z  5 The ongoing large spectroscopic campaign PI
Almaini with the Very Large Telescope to observe galaxies
in the UDS with both VIMOS and FORS2 will in the near
future allow us to further test and rene our results
4 LUMINOSITY FUNCTION
Building on the reliable SED tting procedure described
previously in this Section we exploit our large sample of
UDS galaxies to characterise the evolution of the rest-frame
near-infrared LF Following Cirasuolo et al 2007 the rest-
frame absolute K-band magnitudes have been computed by
using the closest observed band to the rest-frame K-band
depending on the redshift of the source This method in fact
minimises the uncertainties related to the k-corrections
The rest-frame K-band LF in the redshift range 02 
 4 has been computed by using two independent meth-
ods the 1Vmax method Schmidt 1968 and the maximum
likelihood analysis of Marshall et al 1983 Our results are

shift for  1200 galaxies in the UDS sample with secure spectro-

tion Smail et al in preparation Simpson et al 2006a Simpson
et al in preparation The small inset shows the distribution of
z1  z The agreement is remarkably good the mean value of
the distribution of z1  z is 0008 with a standard deviation
  0034 excluding the clear outliers see text for details
shown in Fig 3 The LF in twelve redshift intervals com-
puted via 1Vmax method is shown in the gure as solid
dots The error-bars on the determination of the space den-
sity of sources in each redshift and magnitude bin account
for both Poissonian statistical errors and the uncertainty
in the photometric redshifts The latter has been estimated
by reconstructing several LFs perturbing the value of the
photometric redshift within its 1 condence interval For
each source the SED-tting procedure provides the best-t
redshift identied by the lowest value of the 2 and the
1 interval dened as the redshift space around the best-t
minimum with 2  2
min  1 marginalising over
the other free parameters in the SED tting eg age red-
dening etc We performed Monte Carlo realizations with
each source being allocated a random value for its redshift
within its 1 condence interval and having its luminosity
recomputed appropriately before reconstructing the LF The
errors reported in Fig 3 reect the maximum dierences in
the LF obtained from these dierent realizations
z  2
An independent estimation of the LF has been obtained
by using the maximum likelihood analysis This method is
less biased by strong density inhomogeneity in the eld com-
pared to the 1Vmax method but requires an a priori as-
sumption regarding the shape of the LF This latter has been
parameterised with a Schechter function Schechter 1976

verted to AB using KAB  KV ega  19 and using h  07
derived by Kochanek et al 2001 from the Two Micron All
Sky Survey 2MASS It is worth noting that this value is
very close to the value 2231  003 derived by Cole et
al 2001 The maximum likelihood analysis was performed
by minimizing over the other ve free parameters the faint
end slope  and four parameters zM  kM  z k describ-
ing the evolution with redshift The best t values for these
parameters are given in Table 1 along with the overall nor-
malization at redshift zero 0z  0 obtained a posteriori
by tting the observed number counts It is reassuring that

the value of 0z  0 we obtain is in excellent agreement
with the local value of 00039 Mpc3 and 00037 Mpc3
derived by Kochanek et al 2001 and Cole et al 2001
respectively
First of all it is worth noting the excellent agreement
between the estimation of the LF obtained with the two
independent methods 1Vmax and maximum likelihood as
shown in Fig 3 The large sample of galaxies provided by
the UDS has allowed us to split the LF into narrow redshift
and magnitude bins while still preserving high statistical
signicance
As a further check of the reliability of our results we
nd our estimate of the LF to be consistent with previous
studies published in the literature In Fig 4 we show the
comparison with results obtained by Pozzetti et al 2003
from the K20 survey Caputi et al 2006 from the Great
Observatories Origins Deep Survey GOODS  Chandra
Deep Field South CDFS and Saracco et al 2006 from
the Hubble deep eld south HDF-S In particular Saracco
et al exploited the very deep near-infrared observations of
the HDF-S FIRES Franx et al 2003 down to K  249 to
derive an estimate of the faint end of the LF up to z  3
They found the value of the slope of the LF to be unchanged
with redshift consistent with the results we have obtained
here from the maximum-likelihood analysis   1 The
small discrepancy in the normalization at z  2 between our
LF and the one estimated by Saracco et al can be ascribed
to the fact that their LF is actually computed over a wider
redshift range 19  z  4 whereas we have simply plotted
the LF at z  25
Overall our estimate of the LF is in good agreement
with previous results However the much larger statistics
provided by the UDS dataset has produced a substantial
improvement in the determination of the LF and its cos-
mological evolution As clearly shown in Fig 3 the unique
combination of area and depth provided by the UDS allows
the evolution of the LF and in particular the bright end
of the LF to be accurately traced out to z  3 In fact
the large increase in the areal coverage compared to previ-
ous studies  more than a factor 16 compared to the CDFS
and a factor of nearly 400 larger than the HUDF-FIRES 
has allowed us to trace the evolution of rare brightmassive
galaxies with unprecedented accuracy
The maximum-likelihood analysis and the direct com-
parison of our results with the local K-band LF obtained
by Kochanek et al 2001 and Cole et al 2001 suggest
a combination of luminosity and density evolution for the
LF with cosmic time In agreement with previous studies
Pozzetti et al 2003 Drory et al 2003 Feulner et al 2003
Caputi et al 2006 Saracco et al 2006 Cirasuolo et al 2007
we conrm the substantial brightening of the characteristic
luminosity by  1 magnitude from z  0 to z  2 and
an overall decrement in the total normalization by a factor
 35 over the same redshift interval Given the exponen-
tial tail of the bright end of the LF the net result of this
combined luminosity and density evolution is that the space
density of the brightest sources with MK  24 rapidly in-
creases from the local Universe up to z  1 and then stays
roughly constant up to z  2 with a mild decline at higher
redshift see Fig 5 This suggests that a large population
of very brightmassive galaxies have assembled the bulk of
 3 On the
their stars at high redshift in the range 1 
other hand the sharp decline in the space density of these
 1 is mainly due to the fading of the
bright systems at z 
characteristic luminosity M 
K  consistent with the passive
evolution of a single stellar population as shown in Cira-
suolo et al 2007 This strongly suggests that by z  1
massive galaxies have terminated their mass assembly phase
and that their luminosities then proceed to fade passively
with cosmic time
 z 
The evolutionary behaviour of less-luminous objects is
somewhat dierent As shown in Fig 5 the space density
of galaxies with intermediate luminosity MK  22 the
local value of the characteristic luminosity M 
K  is roughly
constant up to z  1 but then decreases by more than a
factor of 5 by z  3 The evolution of less luminous galaxies
eg MK  20 is even more rapid with a decline in the
space density of a factor  2 already apparent by z  1
and by more than a factor 4 at z  2 It is worth noticing
that in this latter case with the current sample we can only
directly trace the very faint sources with MK  20 out to
z  12 At higher redshift we rely on the extrapolation at
low luminosities of the LF given by the maximum likelihood
analysis but as shown in Fig 4 the faint-end slope of the
LF at these redshifts is consistent with the results obtained
by Saracco et al 2006
5 COMPARISON WITH PREDICTIONS OF
THEORETICAL MODELS
The presence of a large population of massive galaxies at
high redshift has presented a major challenge for models of
galaxy formation In fact models able to reproduce the local
luminosity function have often largely under-predicted the
number of brightmassive galaxies at high redshift White 
Frenk 1991 Kaumann et al 1993 Cole et al 2000 Menci
et al 2002 On the other hand models tuned to create more
massive systems at high redshift have struggled to prevent
further cooling ows and the continuous growth of these
systems resulting in an over-prediction of massive systems
in the local Universe Kaumann et al 1999ab
The mutual feedback between star formation and ac-
cretion onto the central black hole has proven to be very ef-
fective in solving this problem The energy injected into the
system by nuclear activity is able to quench star-formation
and expel the remaining cold gas from the galaxy see Ciotti
 Ostriker 1997 Silk  Rees 1998 Fabian 1999 This nu-
clear feedback was rst successfully introduced into a cos-
mological framework of galaxy formation by Granato et al
2001 2004 and then implemented by many other authors

2006 Menci et al 2006 Monaco et al 2007
the gas is in quasi hydrostic conditions particularly at low
redshift
In this section we compare our results with the predic-
tions of some of the latest models of galaxy formation most
of them including some kind of recipe for active galactic
nuclei AGN feedback
Firstly we considered two semi-analytical models by
Bower et al 2006 and De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 which im-
plement the physics of baryonic collapse growth of the cen-
tral black hole and feedback from supernov and AGN on
the Millennium simulation of the growth of the dark matter
structures in the CDM cosmology Springel et al 2005
Both models implement feedback from nuclear activity
to quench cooling ows and regulate the formation of mas-
sive systems Even though they utilise dierent prescriptions
described in Bower et al 2006 and Croton et al 2006
both models assume the nuclear feedback to be driven by
low-energy radio activity the so-called radio mode which
occurs at low accretion rates and is found to be eective if
We also considered two other semi-analytical models
which implement a rather dierent treatment for the AGN
feedback Menci et al 2006 present a model in which star-
formation and BH growth is triggered by galaxy encounters
both merging and y-by In this model the nuclear feedback
is produced during the short AGN phase where a blast wave
from the central region is able to sweep the cold gas content
of the galaxy on a shorter time scale and at higher redshift
compared to the radio mode used by Bower et al 2006
and Croton et al 2006
A similar quasar mode feedback in which the radia-
tion pressure from the nuclear activity blows out the cold gas
from the galaxy has been adopted by Monaco et al 2007
and Fontanot et al 2008 They have also implemented a
revised treatment for the radiative cooling of the shocked
gas and feedback from galactic winds and superwinds
Finally we compared our results with the predictions

Figure 5 Evolution of the space density of sources with dierent
rest-frame K-band luminosities as derived from the maximum-
likelihood analysis and normalised to their corresponding local
obtained with fully hydrodynamic simulations in a cosmo-
logical context by Nagamine et al 2006 and Cen  Os-
triker 2006 These simulations use a dierent approach
from semi-analytical models since they solve a full set of
hydro-dynamical equations for the evolution of dark mat-
ter and baryons simultaneously These simulations imple-
ment the standard equations of gravity hydrodynamics and
atomic physics radiative transfer heating and cooling of the
gas and supernovae feedback
As shown in Fig 6 the new generation of theoretical
models are better able to reproduce the overall shape of the
LF compared to previous models Kaumann et al 1993
Cole et al 2000 Menci et al 2002 In particular the in-
clusion of the feedback from the central BH improves the
quenching of star-formation in bright massive systems bet-
ter reconciling the predicted bright end of the LF with the
observations
However even though there is a broad consistency 
in particular with the prescriptions given by Bower et al
 the large fraction of bright galaxies already in place at
high redshift is still challenging for the semi-analytical mod-
els Especially at the highest redshifts some of the mod-
els still predict far fewer bright galaxies than are observed
It is worth noticing that the predictions from De Lucia 
Blaizot 2007 Monaco et al 2007 Menci et al 2006 and
Nagamine et al 2006 all include a correction for attenua-
tion by dust which is of course more realistic but introduces
more uncertainties in the predicted LF in particular at the
bright end
On the other hand the hydrodynamical simulations
tend to over-predict the number of massive galaxies at any
redshift This could be due both to resolution eects and to a
lack of feedback from the central AGN When the resolution
is not sucient galaxies tend to over-merge in high-density
regions The other issue is that the current hydrodynami-
cal simulations do not yet include explicit implementation
of AGN feedback which has proven to be very eective in
suppressing the bright end of the luminositymass function
It is interesting to notice that most of the models are
able to reproduce well the space density of galaxies at the
knee of the LF but they consistently over-predict the space
density of low-luminosity objects This is probably due to
very inecient star formation in low-mass systems In fact
from the modelling perspective the feedback from AGN be-
comes negligible in these low-mass systems and reducing
the star-formation eciency parameter also dramatically re-
duces the amount of feedback This makes the discs gas rich
and prone to low but continuous star-formation This re-
sults in the over-prediction of the number of low-mass sys-
tems actually observed Interestingly the modelling of the
star formation in the hydrodynamical simulation at least
around z  1 seems to be able to reproduce the shape of
the faint end of the LF oering some promise that the prob-
lem of the excess of low-luminosity sources can be resolved
6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have presented new results on the cosmological evolu-
tion of the near-infrared galaxy luminosity function from
the local Universe up to z  4 The analysis is based on a
large and highly-complete sample of galaxies selected from
the rst data release of the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey Ex-
ploiting a master catalogue of K- and z-selected galaxies
over an area of 07 square degrees we analysed a sample
of  50 000 galaxies all of which possess reliable photome-
try in 16 bands from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared
This large multi-wavelength coverage has allowed us to ob-
tain accurate photometric redshifts and reliable estimates of
rest-frame K-band luminosities up to high redshift
The near-infrared LF and its cosmological evolution has
been derived by using two independent methods 1Vmax
and maximum likelihood and the errors computed taking
into account the uncertainties in the photometric redshift
estimation In particular via the maximum-likelihood anal-
ysis we obtained a simple parameterization for the LF and
its cosmological evolution which provides an excellent de-
scription of the data from z  0 up to z  4
The unique combination of large area and depth oered
by the UDS has allowed us to trace the evolution of the LF
with unprecedented accuracy In agreement with previous
studies we nd the evolution of the LF to be well described
by a combination of luminosity and density evolution Given
the shape of the LF this results in a dierential evolution
of galaxy number density dependent on galaxy luminosity
and reveals once again the downsizing behaviour of galaxy
formation Brightmassive galaxies are assembled at high
 3 and then they passively evolved over
redshift 1 
the last few billion years while the formation of intermediate
and low luminosity objects is progressively shifted to lower
redshifts
 z 
This anti-hierarchical behaviour is broadly reproduced
by most of the latest generation of theoretical models of
galaxy formation In this work we compared our observa-
tional results with the predictions of both semi-analytical
models Bower et al 2006 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 Monaco
et al 2007 Menci et al 2006 and hydrodynamical simula-

prediction obtained by hydrodynamical simulations Nagamine et al 2006 Cen  Ostriker 2006
tions Nagamine et al 2006 Cen  Ostriker 2006 The
inclusion of feedback from nuclear accretion has dramat-
ically improved the ability of these models to reproduce
the bright end of the LF However especially at high red-
shift there is still a wide scatter in the predicted number
of luminous galaxies produced by the dierent prescriptions
for the physical processes implemented in the various semi-
analytical models On the other hand hydrodynamical sim-
ulations that have yet to incorporate AGN feedback still
systematically over-predict the number of brightmassive
galaxies
Although encouraging these comparisons show that
substantial discrepancies between the models and the data
are still present In particular all models tend to over-
predict the number of low-luminosity galaxies at any red-
shift This is probably due to very low star-formation e-
ciency in real low-mass systems which is dicult to imple-
ment in the models This problem seems to be less severe in
the hydrodynamical simulations but only at low redshift
In conclusion while the overall qualitative agreement
between the data and the models is promising some ten-
sion is still clearly present at both low and high luminosi-
ties This suggests that probably some fundamental physical
processes isare still missing in the models or that the
models need to be further ne tuned This also shows how
detailed and accurate observational estimates of the space
density of galaxies in particular at high redshift can prove
to be a very powerful tool for the testing of galaxy-formation
models In the near future we aim to exploit the forthcom-
ing deeper Spitzer IRAC and MIPS observations in the UDS
to extend the study presented here to the direct derivation
of stellar-mass growth and star-formation as a function of
cosmic time
