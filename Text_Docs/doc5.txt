Abstract. The study of the chemical composition of Planetary Nebulae in external galaxies
is of paramount importance for the ﬁelds of stellar evolution and chemical enrichment history
of galaxies. In recent years a number of spectroscopic studies with 6-8m-class telescopes have
been devoted to this subject improving our knowledge of, among other, the time-evolution of
the radial metallicity gradient in disk galaxies, the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies, and
stellar evolution at low metallicity.

1. Introduction
The determination of the chemical composition of Planetary Nebulae (PNe) in external
galaxies is extremely important both from the point of view of the stellar evolution,
allowing us to study the stellar nucleosynthesis in diﬀerent conditions, and from that of
the formation and evolution of galaxies, giving us the unique possibility to determine
directly the chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) in diﬀerent epochs
that the present one, such as, for example, at the time of the formation of the PN
progenitors.
The two points of view described above are strictly related. In fact, to understand
the chemical evolution of the host galaxy, we need to constrain the ISM chemical his-
tory, which in turn can be done eﬀectively by knowing the elemental abundances of
evolutionary-invariant elements. It is thus necessary to understand where and in which
conditions (e.g., mass range, metallicity) elements such as oxygen or neon could be
dredged-up to the stellar surface and consequently modify the composition of the original
interstellar cloud, where the progenitor star did form.
In this review we present recent results obtained with large-aperture, multi-object spec-
troscopy of extragalactic PNe. section 1 analyzes the PN and HII region abundances, and
their radial metallicity distribution, in the spiral galaxies M33 and M81. The two pop-
ulations allow inspection of time-evolution of the radial metallicity gradient. In Section
2 we present the properties of PNe in dwarf galaxies, and their impact on chemical
evolutionary models.

2. The time-evolution of the radial metallicity gradient
One of the most discussed questions about the radial metallicity gradient in disk galax-
ies is its evolution with time, which to date cannot be constrained by the existing arrays
of chemical evolutionary models. Classical chemical evolutionary models predict diﬀerent
temporal behaviors depending on assumptions over the gas inﬂow and outﬂow rates, the
star and cloud formation eﬃciencies, and other set-up physical conditions. Models might
predict a steepening of metallicity gradients with time (e.g., Chiappini et al. 1997, 2001),
or, conversely, a ﬂattening of such gradients (e.g., Moll´a et al. 1997, 2005; Magrini et
al. 2007b). The main diﬀerences between the two groups of models are the eﬃciency of
the enrichment processes in the inner and outer regions of the disk, and the nature of
the material (primordial or pre-enriched) falling from the halo onto the disk. In all the
above-cited models, however, the dynamical eﬀects, and the possible migration of stellar
populations, have been neglected, thus they might oversimplify the actual problem under
exam (see for example L´epine et al (2011) for a description of the eﬀect of spiral arms
on gradients).
To better understand galaxy evolution we need observational constraints for the theo-
retical scenarios. The comparison between chemical abundances of PNe and HII regions
seems to be a very promising way to set strong constraints to the models, since the ele-
mental abundances of both populations can be derived using the same set of observations,
the similar data reduction and analysis techniques, and identical abundance determina-
tion methods, yet they deﬁne diﬀerent evolutionary times of the galaxy. In this way it
is possible to avoid most of the biases due to the stellar vs. nebular analyses, in par-
ticular allowing the direct comparison of the same element, oxygen, at two epochs, and
thus avoiding the dangerous comparison between α- and iron-peak-elements, whose ratio
depends on the star formation history of the galaxy.
2.1. The PN populations in M33 and M81
We have studied the PN and HII region populations in two nearby spiral galaxies, M33
and M81. M33 (also called NGC 598) belongs to the Local Group, at the distance of
850 kpc (Galleti et al. 2004, Sarajedini et al. 2006). The M33 metallicity gradient de-
rived from α-element abundances has been the focus of several studies, involving both
PNe and HII regions (e.g., Crockett et al. 2006, Magrini et al. 2004, 2007a, 2009, 2010,
Rosolowsky & Simon 2008, Rubin et al. 2008, Bresolin 2011). On the other hand, M81
(also NGC 3031) is the largest member of the nearest interacting group of galaxies
at a distance of 3.60 Mpc (Freedman et al. 2001). Until a recent spectroscopic study
(Stanghellini et al. 2010), the α-element abundances of PNe and HII regions in M81 have
remained elusive, with the exception of 17 H II regions studied by Garnett & Shields
(1987), The advantage of studying M33 and M81 instead of the Galaxy as a playground
for gradients is that extragalactic PNe have well determined galactocentric distances
(with relative errors within 5%), compared to the large indetermination of Galactic PN
distances (Stanghellini et al. 2009).
The ﬁrst step of the gradient analysis is to conﬁrm which elements can be used to trace
the past ISM composition. The best candidates are oxygen and neon, and we should ﬁnd
out whether these elements could be modiﬁed through low- and intermediate-mass stars
(LIMS) evolution. A possible way to verify this is to study the relationship between
neon and oxygen abundances. These elements derive both from primary nucleosynthesis,
mostly in stars with M>10 M⊙. If the O/H and Ne/H abundances are really independent
of the evolution of the PN progenitors through the AGB phase, we should observe a tight
correlation between their abundances. In Figure 1 we plot O/H against Ne/H for the 55
JD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe
Figure 1. The relationship between oxygen and neon abundances in M33. Type I PNe and
non-type I PNe are plotted as ﬁlled circles and empty circles respectively, according to the
deﬁnition of Dopita & Meatheringham (1991). The continuous line is the weighted least square
ﬁt to the complete sample of PNe.
M33 PNe where both abundances were available. The slope of the correlation is close to
unity, 0.90±0.11, pointing at a locked variation of these two elements, and conﬁrming that
there is no evidence of enhancement of oxygen and neon in PNe at M33 metallicities. It
is possible that nucleosynthesis could aﬀect the alpha-element abundances at much lower
metallicities. But this eﬀect would be null at M81 metallicities, higher than those of
M33, thus for both galaxies analyzed here we could safely assume O vs. Ne evolutionary
lockstep (Stanghellini et al. 2010).
The second step is to identify the PNe with the least massive progenitors, thus the
oldest ones, such as for example the non-Type I PNe. In this way one could detect the
signature of galactic chemical evolution in the comparison of old PN progenitors with
the young stellar population traced by the HII regions. If we examine the locus of M33
and M81 disk PNe on the He/H-N/O plane we can single out the Type I PNe, and then
select the remaining PNe as the oldest population in either galaxy. It is worth recalling
that the Type I PNe are metallicity dependent (the amount of nitrogen produced by
hot bottom burning is dependent on the amount of carbon, and the oxygen abundance
depends on the metallicity of the galaxy, see Magrini et al. 2009 and Stanghellini et al.
2010 for details). No Type I PN has been detected in M81. Also, interestingly, no M81

with ﬁlled circles (blue), non-Type I PNe with empty squares (green).
PN shows the HeII 4686 emission line. On the other hand, about 20% of the observed
PNe in M33 are of Type I, and we detected HeII 4686 in many PNe. We conclude that the
populations of the brightest PNe in galaxies strongly depend upon galactic metallicity.
In fact, at high metallicities, such as in M81, the brightest PNe are not those with
the hottest Central Stars (CSs). The post-AGB shells with very hot CSs are enshrouded
in dust at early phases of their evolution, thus still thick to the Hα radiation. The
thinning time depends on metallicity, being shorter at low metallicity, and too long at
M81 metallicity to allow us to observe PNe with massive progenitors among the brightest
ones. For this reason in M81 we detect only PNe with low mass progenitors.
2.2. The radial metallicity gradients
Once deﬁned the sample of old PNe, we compared their radial gradient with that of HII
regions. In M33 we found for non-Type PNe (72 objects)
12 + log(O/H) = (8.41 ± 0.06) − (0.030 ± 0.013) × RGC
where RGC is the de-projected galactocentric distance. For HII regions, including the
literature data described in Magrini et al. (2010) and the new data of Bresolin (2011) for
the HII regions located in the central part of M33,
12 + log(O/H) = (8.50 ± 0.02) − (0.045 ± 0.006) × RGC .
By taking into account the new data for HII regions by Bresolin 2011, there is a slight
trend to a metallicity gradient steepening with time. In addition we found that the global
metal content has evolved ∼0.1 dex from the epoch of the formation of the PN progenitors
JD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe
to the present-time. The result is more appreciable if we compare 12+log(O/H) averaged
on bins of 1 kpc as shown in Figure 2.
In M81 we can play with less objects, ﬁnding for PNe (19 objects)
12 + log(O/H) = (8.72 ± 0.18) − (0.055 ± 0.02) × RGC
and for HII regions (31 objects, from Garnett & Shields 1987 and from Stanghellini et
al. 2010)
12 + log(O/H) = (9.37 ± 0.24) − (0.093 ± 0.02) × RGC .
The tendency seems again to favour a steepening with time, but the sample of HII
regions for which a direct measurement of the electron temperature is available is very
limited both in number and galactocentric distance. The result for M81 need a further
investigation extending the analysis to the very central regions and the extreme periphery
of the galaxy.
It is very interesting to compare ther above ﬁndings with one of the most recent chemi-
cal evolutionary models (Rahimi et al. 2011). These Authors derived the evolution of the
radial abundance gradients of the disk stars of a galaxy simulated with a three dimen-
sional, fully cosmological chemical and dynamical galaxy evolution code. The comparison
of their gradient for young disk stars. i.e. formed during the ﬁnal 2 Gyr of the galaxy
life-time, with intermediate disk stars with ages 2 Gyr<Age<6 Gyr is very similar to the
observational ﬁndings described above for HII regions and non-Type I PNe: a translation
toward higher metallicity, indication a global enrichment, and a slight tendency to have
gradient for the youngest population stepper than that of the oldest one.
3. The chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies
PNe belonging to dwarf galaxies are extremely interesting both because they allow
us to investigate stellar evolution at low metallicity, and they give information about
chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. During the past ﬁve years the knowledge about
PNe in dwarf galaxies has improved, and now the physical and chemical parameters of
PNe in many nearby dwarf galaxies have been derived. A recent reference list includes
the dwarf Irregular (dIrrs) galaxies Sextans A and B (Magrini et al. 2005, Kniazev et
al. 2005), IC 10 (Kniazev et al. 2008, Magrini & Gon¸calves 2009, Yin et al. 2010), and
NGC3109 and NGC6822 (Pena et al. 2007, Hern´andez-Martnez et al. 2009); and the dwarf
spheroidal companions of M31, NGC 185, NGC205, M32, and NGC147 (Gon¸calves et
al. 2007, Richer & McCall 2008, Gon¸calves et al. 2011) and of our Galaxy, Fornax and
Sagittarius (Kniazev et al. 2007, Kniazev et al. 2008). In the following we describe some
of the the most relevant results among the above papers.
3.1. Third dredge-up and positive oxygen yields at low metallicity
One important aspect of stellar evolution is whether or not the eﬃciency of the third
dredge-up (TDU, i.e., the process which brings the elements characterising the PN com-
position to the stellar surface during the AGB phase) depends on metallicity. Some stellar
evolutionary models claim that such a dependence is strong, and that when the metallic-
ity is very low, even the elements previously not known to be dredged-up, such as neon
and oxygen, are indeed carried to the stellar surface (e.g. Suda & Fujimoto 2010, Karakas
However, the observational evidence of this low-metallicity phenomenon is still scarce.
Observations of increasingly larger samples of Local Group PNe helped to analyze the
occurrence of the TDU. In Figure 3 we show Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O versus O/H of several

corresponding galaxy identiﬁcation at the top of the plot.
PN populations in dIrrs, plotted with the average oxygen abundance of the host galaxy
HII regions (the vertical lines, see ﬁgure label).
The occurrence of the TDU in PNe is identiﬁed by: i) higher O/H with respect to the
corresponding ratio of HII regions; and ii) diﬀerent Ne/O, S/O and Ar/O ratios with
respect to the HII regions. Neon, sulphur, and argon are dredged-up less eﬃciently than
oxygen, in most cases. We note PNe and HII regions have similar O/H ratios at high
metallicity, while at low metallicity, in particular when 12+log(O/H)< 7.7-7.8, many
PNe are richer in oxygen than the present-time ISM (in Fig.3, these are found at the
right of the average HII regions metallicity). This does not occur for all the metal poor
PNe, probably because the TDU is related not only to the metal content, but also to the
stellar mass and to other parameters such as rotation or magnetic ﬁelds.
A similar analysis can not be done in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, due to the absence
of a HII region population. Useful diagrams that identify the presence of the TDU in
PNe belonging to dwarf spheroidals have been developed by Richer & McCall (2008).
JD 11. Chemical abundances of Extragalactic PNe
For example, the diagrams showing Ne/H vs O/H, or N/Ne vs Ne/O, can give useful
hints of the TDU occurrence. Richer & McCall found a group of PNe having low Ne/O
and high nitrogen (which is usually a signature of massive progenitors), indicating that,
occasionally, oxygen is produced during the evolution of the stellar progenitors even in
galaxies where star formation is not present.
3.2. The chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies
The large amount of information available for nearby dwarf galaxies, such as their gas
and star content, their metallicity distribution, and their star formation history, allows
us to use them to test chemical evolution models. As an example, for IC10 Magrini &
Gon¸calves (2009) obtained the composition of a sample of HII regions and PNe. They
found a very limited enrichment in the metal content of IC10 in the time elapsed between
the birth of PN progenitors and the present-time. Yin et al (2010) compared these results
with a series of chemical evolutionary models in which they varied the star formation
history (from continuous to burst) and included diﬀerent treatments and assumptions for
galactic winds, namely respectively a model with no winds at all, one with standard wind
treatment, where the wind has the same chemical composition of the ISM, and ﬁnally a
model with metal-enhanced winds.
Both models without wind and those with standard wind (i.e., stripping both H and
metals from the galaxy) disagree with the observational data, contrary to the model with
a metal-enhanced wind, which resulted to be in better agreement with the observations.
The best model to ﬁt current data sets consists of a continuous wind that develops from
the ﬁrst burst of star formation in the galaxy, and that strips the galaxy mostly its heavy
elements.
