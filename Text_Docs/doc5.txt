Abstract The adhesion zone of immune cells the immunological synapse exhibits
characteristic domains of receptor-ligand complexes The domain formation is
likely caused by a length dierence of the receptor-ligand complexes and has been
investigated in experiments in which T cells adhere to supported membranes with
anchored ligands For supported membranes with two types of anchored ligands
MHCp and ICAM1 that bind to the receptors TCR and LFA1 in the cell membrane
the coexistence of domains of TCR-MHCp and LFA1-ICAM1 complexes in the cell
adhesion zone has been observed for a wide range of ligand concentrations and anities
For supported membranes with long and short ligands that bind to the same cell
receptor CD2 in contrast domain coexistence has been observed for a rather narrow
ratio of ligand concentrations In this article we determine detailed phase diagrams
for cells adhering to supported membranes with a statistical-physical model of cell
adhesion We nd a characteristic dierence between the adhesion scenarios in which
two types of ligands in a supported membrane bind i to the same cell receptor or ii
to two dierent cell receptors which helps to explain the experimental observations
Our phase diagrams fully include thermal shape uctuations of the cell membranes
on nanometer scales which lead to a critical point for the domain formation and to a
cooperative binding of the receptors and ligands
Segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
1 Introduction
Cell adhesion is mediated by the specic binding of a variety of membrane-anchored
receptor and ligand molecules In 1990 Springer suggested that the length dierence of
receptor-ligand complexes in the contact zone of immune cells may lead to segregation
ie to the formation of domains within the cell contact zone that contain receptor-
ligand complexes with dierent lengths 1 The length of a receptor-complex here is
the intermembrane distance or local membrane separation at the site of the complex
A length dierence between receptor-ligand complexes leads to an indirect membrane-
mediated repulsion of the complexes because the membranes have to bend to compensate
the mismatch which costs bending energy Important receptor-ligand complexes in T-
cell adhesion are the TCR-MHCp complex with a length of about 13 nm 2 the CD2-
CD48 complex with the same length of 13 nm 35 and the LFA1-ICAM1 complex with
a length of about 40 nm 6 In 1998 and 1999 the contact zone of T cells was indeed
found to contain domains that either contain the short TCR-MHCp or the long LFA1-
ICAM1 complexes 7 8 As expected from their length the CD2-CD48 complexes
are located within the TCR-MHCp domains 5 However the question whether the
domain formation is predominantly caused by the length mismatch of receptor-ligand
complexes is complicated by the role of the actin cytoskeleton which polarizes during
T-cell adhesion and transports clusters of TCR-MHCp complexes towards the center of
the cell contact zone 911 and by additional direct protein-protein interactions 12
The domain formation is closely linked to T-cell activation with TRC clusters forming
within seconds of T-cell adhesion triggering the rst activation signals 9 13
Direct evidence for a central role of the length of receptor-ligand complexes comes
from experiments in which these lengths are altered by protein engineering 5 14
Milstein and coworkers 5 have considered variants of the protein CD48 with four and
ve immunoglobolin-like Ig-like domains The CD48 variants are longer than the
CD48 wildtype which contains only two Ig-like domains The CD48 wildtype and both
CD48 variants bind to CD2 on T cells From electron micrographs of the contact zone
between T cells and supported membranes that contain one of the three CD48 types
Milstein and coworkers found that the length of the CD2-CD48 complex is 128  14
nm for wildtype CD48 142  12 nm for the CD48 variant with four Ig-like domains
and 156  14 nm for the variant with ve Ig-like domains In uorescence experiments
of T cells on supported membranes that contain mixtures of two of the three CD48
types Milstein and coworkers observed that CD2-CD48 wildtype complexes segregate
from both CD2-CD48 variant complexes The segregation seems to be driven by the
length dierence of the complexes since the T-cell cytoskeleton can only act on CD2
and thus can hardly discriminate between the dierent complexes However Milstein
and coworkers observe domain coexistence in the contact zone only within a narrow
range of concentration ratios of CD48 wildtype and CD48 variants For T cells adhering
to supported membranes with MHCp and ICAM1 in contrast domain coexistence
has been observed for a rather wide range of MHCp and ICAM1 concentrations and

In this article we calculate detailed phase diagrams for cells adhering to supported
membranes with anchored ligands We consider two general adhesion scenarios In the
rst scenario long and short ligands in the supported membrane bind to the same cell
receptor see section 4 as in the experiments of Milstein and coworkers 5 in which
CD48 wildtype and a CD28 variant in the supported membrane both bind to CD2 in
the T-cell membrane
In the second scenario two types of ligands in the supported
membrane bind to two types of receptors in the cell membrane see section 5 as in
experiments in which MHCp and ICAM1 in the supported membrane bind to TCR and
LFA1 in the T-cell membrane We nd a characteristic dierence between the phase
diagrams in the two scenarios see g 5 In the rst scenario domain coexistence only
occurs along a coexistence line In the second scenario in contrast domain coexistence
occurs in a wide coexistence region Our phase diagrams thus help to understand
why Milstein and coworkers observe domain coexistence only within a narrow range
of concentration ratios
Our calculations are based on a statistical-physical model of cell adhesion see
section 2 In this model the membranes are described as elastic sheets discretized into
small patches that can contain single receptor or ligand molecules 1619 The binding
and domain formation of receptor-ligand complexes is aected by thermally excited
shape uctuations of the membranes on nanometer scales These shape uctuations
lead to a critical point for the segregation of long and short receptor-ligand complexes
19 20 The critical point depends on the length dierence of the complexes on the
concentrations and anities of the receptors and ligands and on the bending rigidity of
the membranes see section 4 The critical point constitutes a threshold for segregation
or domain formation and may help to understand why Milstein and coworkers have
observed segregation of wildtype CD48 from each of the two CD48 variants but not
segregation of the two CD48 variants 5 In addition the membrane shape uctuations
on nanoscales lead to a cooperative binding of receptor-ligand complexes 21 see section
2 Statistical-physical description of cell adhesion
Cell adhesion involves length scales that dier by orders of magnitude see g 1 The
diameters of the cell and cell contact zone have values of several micrometers while
the average separation of the membranes within the contact zone is typically tens of
nanometers Other important length scales in the cell contact zone are the average
distance between receptor-ligand bonds and the binding width of receptor and ligand
molecules The binding width is the dierence between the smallest and the largest
local membrane separation at which the molecules can bind The binding width of the
typically rather sti receptor and ligand proteins that mediate cell adhesion is much
smaller than the length of the proteins
The binding equilibrium and segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell contact
Segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
zones is aected by membrane shape deformations and uctuations Since bound
receptor-ligand complexes constrain the local separation of the membranes the relevant
deformations and uctuations of the membranes occur on lateral length scales smaller
than the average distance between neighboring pairs of complexes which is about 100
nanometers for complex concentrations of about 100 per square micrometer 8
is reasonable to assume that the elasticity of the membranes is dominated by their
bending rigidity on these length scales The binding rigidity  dominates over the
membrane tension  on lateral length scales smaller than the crossover length cid112
22 which is of the order of several hundred nanometers for cell membranes 23
The cytoskeletal elasticity 2427 contributes on length scales larger than the average
distance between the cytoskeletal anchors in the membrane which may be around 100
nanometers 28 The bending rigidity thus is likely to dominate over the lateral tension
and the cytoskeletal elasticity on lateral length scales up to 100 nanometers relevant
We have developed discrete models for the adhesion of membranes via anchored
receptors and ligands 16181929 In discrete models the two apposing membranes in
the contact zone of cells or vesicles are divided into small patches 1618 20 23 2936
In our models the rigidity-dominated elasticity of the membranes in the contact zones
of cells or vesicles is described by 16 18

four nearest-neighbor patches of membrane patch i on the quadratic array of patches
The linear size a of the membrane patches is chosen to be around 5 nm to capture the
whole spectrum of bending deformations of the lipid membranes 37 The eective
bending rigidity of the two membranes with rigidities 1 and 2 is   121  2
If one of the membranes eg membrane 2 is a planar supported membrane the eective

by one receptor or ligand molecule Mobile receptor and ligand molecules diuse by
hopping from patch to patch and the thermal uctuations of the membranes are
reected in variations of the local separation of apposing membrane patches A receptor
can bind to a ligand molecule if the ligand is located in the membrane patch apposing

receptor-ligand complex see g 2 and below
In discrete models the receptor and
ligand molecules are taken into account as individual molecules In continuum models
in contrast the distributions of receptor and ligand molecules on the membranes are
described by continuous concentration proles 3848
3 Adhesion via a single type of receptor-ligand complexes
31 Interaction energy of receptors and ligands
We rst consider the case in which the adhesion is mediated by a single type of receptor-
ligand complexes Examples of this case are i cells adhering to supported membranes
that contain a single type of ligand 5 4951 and ii vesicles with anchored receptors
that adhere to supported membranes or surfaces with complementary ligands 355262

receptors in an apposing cell or vesicle membrane top In our model the membranes
are discretized in small patches which can contain single receptor or ligand molecules
The shape and thermal uctuations of the cell or vesicle membrane in the adhesion
zone are described by the local separations li of apposing membrane patches i A
receptor can bind to a ligand molecule i if the ligand is located in the membrane
patch apposing the receptor and ii if the local membrane separation li is close to the
length of the receptor-ligand complex

are described by the interaction energy 17 21

The binding equilibrium of the membranes in the contact zone can be determined from
the free energy F  kBT lnZ where Z is the partition function of the system kB is
Boltzmanns constant and T is the temperature The partition function Z is the sum
over all possible membrane congurations with each conguration l n m weighted
by the Boltzmann factor exp Hl n mkBT  A membrane conguration in the
contact zone is specied by the separation eld l of the membranes the distribution
m of the receptors in the cell membrane and the distribution n of ligands in the
apposing membrane

For typical concentrations of receptors and ligands in cell adhesion zones up to hundred

membranes is 21

where R is the area concentration of unbound receptors in the cell membrane and L
is the area concentration of unbound ligands in the apposing membrane The binding
equilibrium in the contact zone thus can be determined from considering two membranes
with the elastic energy 1 that interact via an eective adhesion potential with well
depth Uef and width lwe
33 Area fraction Pb of the membranes within binding range of receptors and ligands
Receptor-ligand complexes can only form at membrane patches with a local separation
within the binding range lo  lwe2 of the receptors and ligands see eq 5 The area
concentration RL of the receptor-ligand complexes in the contact zone therefore is
proportional to the fraction Pb of these membrane patches 21

Here K is the equilibrium constant for receptor-ligand binding within this membrane

In equilibrium the fraction Pb of membrane patches with a local separation within
receptor-ligand binding range depends on the eective binding energy Uef the binding
width lwe the eective rigidity  of the membranes and the temperature T  We
have found that the eect of these four quantities on Pb can be captured by a single
dimensionless quantity the rescaled eective potential depth 21

To a rst approximation the membrane fraction Pb depends only on u for typical
lengths and concentrations of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
cell adhesion zones direct contacts between the membranes can be neglected since the
average separation of the membranes which depends on the length lo of the complexes
is typically larger than the thermal membrane roughness 21
Segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
Figure 3 An important quantity is the area fraction Pb of the membranes within
binding separation of the receptors and ligands The area fraction Pb shown in
red increases with the concentrations of receptors and ligands since the formation
of receptor-ligand bonds smoothens out thermal membrane shape uctuations The
smoothening facilitates the formation of additional receptor-ligand bonds and thus
leads to a binding cooperativity 21
From Monte Carlo simulations we have found that the functional dependence of
the area fraction Pb on the rescaled potential depth u is well described by
Pb  u
with the dimensionless coecient c1 cid39 0071 21 The membrane fraction Pb increases
with u and thus increases with the eective binding energy Uef and the eective bending
rigidity  The reason for this increase is that the roughness of the membranes resulting
from thermal shape uctuations decreases with Uef and  The membrane fraction Pb
decreases with the temperature T since the roughness increases with T  The thermal
Segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
roughness dened as the standard deviation of the local membrane separation from its
average is the characteristic length scale for membrane excursions in the perpendicular
direction The membrane fraction Pb within receptor-ligand binding range is much
smaller than 1 if the roughness is large compared to the binding width lwe of the
complexes and close to 1 if the roughness is small compared to lwe
34 Concentrations of bound and unbound receptors of an adhering cell
From eqs 7 to 9 we obtain the relation 21

between the area concentration RL of bound receptor-ligand complexes in the contact
zone and the area concentrations R and L of unbound receptors and ligands This
nonlinear relation reects the cooperative binding of receptors and ligands This
cooperativity arises because the binding of receptors and ligands suppresses thermal
membrane uctuations and thus smoothens the membranes which facilitates the
binding of additional receptors and ligands see g 3
The total number N of receptors in the cell membrane is constant The
concentrations of bound and unbound receptors are therefore connected by the
additional relation 19
N  RA  RLAc
where A is the total area of the cell membrane and Ac the contact area We have
neglected here the area occupied by bound receptor-ligand complexes since this area is
small compared to the total contact area Ac for typical concentrations in cell adhesion
zones The concentrations of unbound receptors within and outside of the contact area
then are equal Together the two relations 10 and 11 determine the concentration
R of unbound receptors and the concentration RL of bound receptors in the contact

As in section 32 the summations over all possible distributions m and n of receptors
and ligands in the partition function of the model leads to an eective adhesion potential
1920 The eective adhesion potential now is a double-well potential see g 4 Both
wells have the same width lwe as the potentials 13 and 14 The well with its center
at the membrane separation li  l1 reects the interactions of the receptors R with
the shorter ligands L1 and the well centered at li  l2 reects the interactions of the
receptors and the longer ligands L2 In analogy to eq 6 the depth of the two wells

depend on the concentrations R L1 and L2 of unbound receptors and ligands and
on the binding constants K1  a2eU1kBT and K2  a2eU2kBT for receptors and ligands
within the appropriate binding ranges 1920 The binding equilibrium of the receptors
R and ligands L1 and L2 in the contact zone thus can be determined from considering
two apposing membranes with elastic energy 1 that interact via an eective double-well
potential with well depths U ef

If the two wells of the eective adhesion potential are relatively shallow thermal
membrane uctuations can easily drive membrane segments to cross from one well to the
other If the two wells are deep the crossing of membrane segments from one well to the
other well is hindered by the potential barrier of width lba between the wells see g 4

as the receptor-ligand interactions 13 and 14 and a separation lba  l2l1lwe that
depends on the dierence between the equilibrium lengths l1 and l2 of the complexes
RL1 and RL2
The potential barrier induces a line tension between adjacent membrane segments that
are bound in dierent wells 63 Beyond a critical depth of the potential wells the
line tension leads to the formation of large membrane domains that are bound in well
one or well two Within each domain the adhesion of the membranes is predominantly
mediated either by the receptor-ligand complexes RL1 or by the complexes RL2

it seems reasonable to assume that the concentrations L1 and L2 of unbound ligands
do not change upon adhesion since the ligand reservoir in the supported membrane is
large The concentrations L1 and L2 in our model then correspond to the experimental

2 of the potential wells if the two wells have the same width lwe The eective
adhesion potential then is a symmetric double-well potential We assume here again
that the total area of the supported membrane is large compared to the cell contact
In this case the numbers of bound ligands in the contact zone is negligible
compared to the numbers of unbound ligands in the total supported membrane which
implies that the concentrations L1 and L2 of unbound ligands do not change during
adhesion However the concentrations R1 and R2 of unbound receptors in general
change during cell adhesion because the contact area is typically a substantial fraction
of the overall area of the cell membrane and because the total numbers N1 and N2 of
the receptors in the cell membrane are constant During adhesion a smaller or larger
fraction of the receptors will form bound complexes R1L1 or R2L2 see also section
34 The concentrations R1L1 and R2L2 of the receptor-ligand complexes in the cell

right-hand sides of eqs 24 and 25 are the numbers of bound receptors In analogy
to eq 7 the number of bound receptors R1 in the domain predominantly bound in
well 1 is K1R1L1AcP

is K2R2L2AcP

predominantly bound in well 2 is K1R1L1Ac1  P

6 Discussion and Conclusions
In this article we have determined phase diagrams for cells adhering to supported
membranes with anchored ligands For supported membranes with short and long
ligands L1 and L2 that bind to the same cell receptor R coexistence of domains of
L1R and L2R complexes in the cell adhesion zone only occurs for equal eective binding
strength K1L1  K2L2 of the complexes where K1 and K2 are the binding equilibrium
constants at appropriate membrane separations The domain coexistence thus occurs
along a line in the L1-L2 plane which ends at the critical point see g 5a We
have assumed that the area of the supported membrane is much larger than the adhesion
zone which implies that the concentrations L1 and L2 of unbound ligands do not
change signicantly during adhesion since the supported membrane constitutes a large
ligand reservoir Constant concentrations of unbound ligands imply constant chemical
potentials 1  kBT lna2L1 and 2  kBT lna2L2 of the ligands in our model see
eq 32 in ref 21 A coexistence line as in the diagram of g 5a is typical for
phase diagrams in grand-canonical ensembles with constant chemical potentials
For supported membranes with two types of ligands L1 and L2 that bind to dierent
cell receptors R1 and R2 we obtain a qualitatively dierent phase diagram with a broad
coexistence region see g 5b Domain coexistence in the cell adhesion zone occurs
for K1R1L1  K2R2L2 The broad coexistence region is a consequence of the fact
that the concentrations of unbound receptors R1 and R2 depend on the numbers of
bound receptors and therefore on the fractions of the cell adhesion zone occupied by the
domains of R1L1 and R2L2 complexes since the total numbers N1 and N2 of receptors
in the cell membrane are constant A broad coexistence region as in the diagram of
g 5b is typical for phase diagrams in canonical ensembles with constant particle
numbers
Milstein and coworkers 5 have observed domain coexistence for a narrow
concentration ratio of short and long ligands that bind to the same cell receptor CD2
in agreement with our phase diagram in g 5a However two dierences between
our phase diagram in g 5a and the phase diagram of Milstein and coworkers in
g 7 of ref 5 are First the coexistence line in the phase diagram of Milstein and
coworkers seems to have a nite width Such a nite width may result from slight
Segregation of receptor-ligand complexes in cell adhesion zones
changes of the ligand concentrations upon binding since several cells adhere to the
same supported membrane in the experiments Second the coexistence line in the
diagram of Milstein and coworkers ends in a region in which the cells do not adhere
while the coexistence line in the diagram of g 5a ends at a critical point In this
article we have neglected repulsive interactions from eg the cell glycocalyx In our
model such repulsive interactions lead to an unbinding of the membranes at certain well
depths U ef
2 of the eective adhesion potential shown in g 4 20 We obtain a
phase diagram similar to the diagram of Milstein and coworkers if the well depths U ef
and U ef
2 at which the membranes unbind are larger than the critical potential depth U ef
which determines the location of the critical point in the diagram of g 5a
1 and U ef
We nd that thermal membrane shape uctuations on nanometer scales play a
central role during cell adhesion Fluctuations on these scales have been recently
reported for immune cells adhering to coated substrates 69 70 In previous work we
have found that the uctuations lead to a cooperative binding of receptors and ligands
see g 3 21 and to a critical point for the segregration of long and short receptor-
ligand complexes 19 20 Our phase diagrams in g 5 are therefore qualitatively
dierent from phase diagrams calculated under neglection of shape uctuations 43
The binding cooperativity of receptors and ligands arises since a receptor-ligand complex
locally constrains the membrane shape uctuations and facilitates the binding of nearby
complexes The binding cooperativity is thus closely related to the uctuation-induced
attractive interactions between bound receptor-ligand complexes 1718297172 which
result from a suppression of membrane-shape uctuations similar to the uctuation-
induced interactions of rigid membrane inclusions 7376
We have neglected here the line tension of the domain boundaries which may
suppress the formation of small domains in the cell adhesion zone In classical nucleation
theory the line tension leads to a threshold size for stable domains Experimental
observations of stable microdomains in the adhesion zones of immune cells 9 13 65 67
indicate that this threshold size is rather small We will consider the line tension between
domains of short and long receptor-ligand complexes in detail in a future article
