I INTRODUCTION
It has recently become clear that the statistical description of the Hawking radiation
process breaks down at low entropy 1 Buoyed by this and other results a number of
authors have investigated the utility of considering low mass black holes as elementary
particles 24
In the present paper I propose taking the particle physics aspects of black hole physics
seriously Due to the absence of any fundamental theory of quantum gravity I will have to
resort to physical reasoning to motivate an estimate for the decay rate
black holei  black holef  massless quantum
For deniteness one may take the massless quantum to be a photon though neutrinos or
linearized gravitons would do as well A major goal of this paper will be to motivate Hawking
radiation from a particle physics perspective minimizing geometrodynamic aspects of the
problem
The estimate for 0bi  bf  that I shall cobble together has several striking features
1 In the limit of a large black hole where statistical techniques will be shown to be ap-
propriate the model predicts emission of a MaxwellBoltzmann spectrum with two free
parameters These two parameters may be xed by matching with Hawkings semiclassical
calculation which is valid in this parameter regime 56
2 If the black hole interacts with a bath of photons stimulated emission occurs The
spontaneous emission rate appropriate for a black hole emitting radiation into a vacuum is
modied   1  hni0 If the external photon bath is in equilibrium with itself at some
temperature T this enhancement factor gives TH T  ehT ehT  10TH If
furthermore the photon bath is also in equilibrium with the black hole itself T  TH
then the emission and absorption spectra are equal to each other and are exactly Planckian
3 Once the two free parameters have been xed in this manner the resulting model con-
tinues to give sensible physical results even when extrapolated to small mass black holes 
strongly suggesting that the nal stage of the Hawking radiation process is a cascade of gam-
mas and other massless quanta leading to complete evaporation with no naked singularity
and no stable massive remnant

II THE MODEL
A Particle physics
Consider the two body decay bi  bf   The initial and nal black holes are parame-
terized by mass M spin J and possess internal states whose number is denoted by N The
interaction vertex is just a photon coupling gravitationally to matter Furthermore the decay
is prohibited neither by phase space considerations nor by any conservation law Therefore
by general particle physics principles this decay must take place The only question is at
what rate Without further ado consider the estimate
hbi  bf      h
mP2  AH
P  hcid182
2Jf  1
2Ji  1cid19 Nf
The various terms in this estimate have the immediate physical interpretation
1 coupling constant The dimensionless coupling constant describing matter coupling to
gravity is g  EmP  The decay rate depends on the square of the coupling constant
2 surface enhancement The emitted photon can couple to the black hole at any point on
its horizon Since the coupling is gravitational one can plausibly argue that dierent pieces
of the horizon of order a Planck length squared in area will couple independently and
incoherently to the emitted radiation This implies a decay rate proportional to the area of
the event horizon
3 phase space The volume of two particle phase space is proportional to h
4 spin factors These arise from a sum over squares of ClebschGordon coecients
5 statistical factors One should average over initial states and sum over nal states The
number of internal states of a black hole of mass M has been denoted NM
An overall dimensionless numerical factor  is left undetermined by this argument
To reiterate the basic ingredient of this estimate If a decay is a kinematically allowed
b does not violate conservation laws and c the initial and nal states are coupled then
that decay will and in fact must take place
B Kinematics
Consider the two body decay bi  bf   Work in the rest frame of the initial state
Elementary kinematics yields the energies of the nal state particles

C MaxwellBoltzmann spectrum
With malice aforethought one denes N  eS Suppose now that for Mif   mP 
one can show Nif   1 Then Sif   1 and one may adopt a statistical approach
treating Mif  Nif  Sif  and h as eectively continuous variables
Combining this statistical approximation with two body kinematics gives for the initial-
nal state factor

Where with further malice aforethought one denes T 1  SMMi At this stage this
is merely a denition but it is instructive to see that the gross features of a thermal spectrum
are already emerging without recourse to curved space quantum eld theory Euclidean
continuations of the metric or similar arcane
Up to this point the argument of this paper has provided the estimate
0bi  bf    2  h

Perhaps more interestingly the decay rate into the frequency interval    d can be
written as
d0bi  bf    2  h
mP2  AH

2Ji  1cid19 exphT  d
Therefore the power radiated into this frequency range is
dP   h d0  2AH h3cid182Jf  1
2Ji  1cid19 exphT  d
which is the MaxwellBoltzmann spectrum promised in the introduction The two param-
eters  T  are now xed by appealing to the known behaviour of the Hawking radiation
in the high frequency limit Taking Ji  Jf  0 comparison with Hawkings original calcu-
lation 56 or any of a number of subsequent calculations 78 shows that   13 and
T  TH
D Stimulated emission
Suppose now that instead of radiating into a vacuum the black hole is radiating into
a bath of photons If a certain mode is already inhabited by n photons it is well known
that the rate n  n  1 is enhanced by stimulated emission nn1  1  n01 After
averaging over n the total emission rate is
  Xn
pnnn1  1  hni01
Now if the photon bath is in equilibrium with itself at some temperature T Bose statistics
implies that hni  exphT  11 The total emission rate for the black hole is then
TH T

ehT  1
0TH
If furthermore the photon bath is also in equilibrium with the black hole itself T  TH
then the emission and absorption spectra are equal to each other and are both exactly
Planckian
E The Bekenstein entropy estimate
From an analogy between the classical law of area growth for event horizons and and the
second law of thermodynamics Bekenstein 9 argued that the physical entropy of a large
black hole is
Here  is an undetermined numerical constant Equivalently the Bekenstein estimate for
the number of internal states of a large black hole is
N  exp  1
By appealing to either curved space quantum eld theoretic calculations 56 or to manipu-
lations involving Euclidean analytic continuations of the manifold 7 Bekensteins estimate
may be veried and the constant  found to be   1 For any reasonably large black hole
this immediately implies N  1 thereby justifying the statistical approximation adopted
F Comments
This calculation though technically trivial teaches one several very important things
1 The existence of Hawking radiation from black holes is ultimately dependent only on the
fact that photons and all other forms of matter couple to gravity 2 The thermal nature
of the Hawking spectrum depends only on the fact that the number of internal states of a
large mass black hole is enormous 3 The formal denitions S  ln N and T 1  SM
really do correspond to the physical entropy and temperature of the black hole 4 These
conclusions are insensitive to the precise nature of the black hole Schwarzschild Reissner
Nordstrom KerrNewman or dilatonic 5 Curved space quantum eld theory calculations
are required only when one wishes to explicitly calculate the entropy or equivalently the
number of internal states as a function geometrodynamic parameters
III THE ISSUE OF THE FINAL STATE
A Generalities
One of the most intriguing aspects of this microscopic modelling of the Hawking radiation
process is that the resulting formalism continues to give meaningful and quite physical
answers when extrapolated to small black holes where the statistical and semiclassical
arguments usually employed fail utterly
All the evidence assembled up to this point indicates that one should take the notion of
the number of internal states of a black hole seriously  as though N were a real physical
parameter Proceed by really taking this notion of the number of internal states seriously
One notes that the number of internal states is by denition an integer One infers a discrete
spectrum for the allowed entropy
SN  ln N
For a general black hole the entropy will be related to the mass and to other parameters
such as charge spin and the presence or absence of a dilaton eld The quantization of
entropy implies a quantization of mass MN with the precise form of MN depending on
the type of black hole in question The spontaneous decay rate is then

For a small black hole this implies the onset of a cascade process with characteristic time
scale of order the Planck time When does one expect this formula to break down If the
emitted photons have energy greater than or of order the Planck mass then their Comp-
ton wavelength is less than their Schwarzschild radius and one would expect the emitted
photons to disappear down their own event horizons rendering the present estimate unre-
liable Conversely if one can show that the energy gaps are small compared to the Planck
scale and if the average energy of emitted photons is small compared to the Planck scale
then there is no obstruction to asserting the validity of this formula down to the lowest mass
scales
One may normalise N so that N  1 corresponds to the lowest mass black hole of the
given type Then the nal decay from the N  1 state should be handled by means dierent
from the above For instance for the lowest mass neutral black hole consider the decay into
two gammas b1     One may easily estimate
b1      cid18 M1
2mPcid19
The only novelty in this estimate is that the amplitude is second order in the coupling
constant g  M12mP  so that the decay rate is fourth order Additionally each photon
can couple independently somewhere on the horizon so there are two area enhancement
factors Naturally the dimensionless constant  is not calculable by present techniques
From a variation of the discussion in the previous paragraph this particular estimate is of
course trustworthy if and only if M12  mP  Again I wish to emphasise a photons
couple to gravity b kinematics allows the decay and c no conservation laws are violated
therefore the decay must take place These ideas generalize For instance for the lowest
mass singly charged black hole b
1 the same sort of analysis can be applied mutatis mutandis
to the decay b
1  e e
This analysis rather strongly suggests that the endpoint of the Hawking evaporation
process is a cascade of gammas and other light particles emitted as the black hole descends
to the N  1 state followed by complete evaporation into two light particles no naked
singularities no stable massive remnants
B Schwarzschild black holes
Consider now an ordinary unadorned Schwarzschild black hole The mass spectrum
alluded to previously is easily seen to be
M 2N  m2
ln1  N
For large N the mass gap between neighbouring states is of order M 2  m2
P N so that
as expected the mass of large mass black holes is eectively a continuous parameter The
spontaneous decay rate is
0bi  bf   
452P ln  1  Ni
1  Nf3
ln1  Ni12 Nf
It may easily be veried that all of the emitted gammas have energy much less than the
Planck mass The highest energy gamma from this cascade arises in the N  2  N  1
decay for which h  mPcid20qln 34 qln 24cid21  00608mP 
The putative nal decay into two gammas b1     produces photons of energy
E  12M1  12qln 24 mP  01174mP  which is indeed safely smaller than
the Planck scale
The lesson to be learned is this from a particle physics perspective the evaporation of a
Schwarzschild black hole can be plausibly tracked all the way to the nal state without ever
having to directly confront Planck scale physics
C Kerr-Newman black holes
Once the mass of a Schwarzschild black hole drops below M  m2
P me the Hawking
temperature rises above the mass of an electron TH  me Once this happens the Hawking
radiation will include electrons and positrons as well as photons and gravitons and neutri-
nos Since electrons and positrons carry o both spin and charge it is clear that any truly
realistic description of black hole evaporation cannot be modelled solely using Schwarzschild
geometry but must at some level include the eects of charge and spin
Consider a charged spinning black hole described by the KerrNewman geometry Adopt
units wherein electric charge is measured in mass units ie q240  GQ2 so that the
charge on an electron is Qe  mP  I shall for the time being content myself with writing
down the spectrum Starting from the standard result for the entropy 1
2M 2 s1 
M 2 
G2M 4
straightforward manipulations yield
M 2  m2
S 
ln1  N 
h2
 JJ  1
The mass spectrum is then simply
M 2N Z J  m2
 ln1  N
Note that J  Z  0 reproduces the Schwarzschild case that N  Z  J  0 is the vacuum
state and that N  0 with Z 6 0 6 J is forbidden Verifying that the mass gaps are small
is an exercise in tedious integer algebra
After spitting out a cascade of gammas charged leptons neutrinos quarks etc the
black hole will minimize its mass by eventually settling to a N  1 J  0 state possibly
with Q 6 0 The most obvious manner in which the black hole might then lose its electric
charge emission of an electron is energetically forbidden since it requires the black hole to
increase its spin Thus subsequent evolution depends on whether or not the particle physics
spectrum contains any charged scalars
If elementary charged scalar particles exist then
there is no barrier to the black hole losing its electric charge by spitting out these charged
scalars thereby descending to the N  1 J  Z  0 state considered previously On the
other hand if charged scalars do not exist the lowest order process leading to charge loss
is the semigravitational semiweak three body decay bZ
i  bZ1
f  e  e which proceeds
J  0 state where the two body decay b
via a virtual W  This process will eventually reduce the black hole to the N  1 Z  1
1  e e can take over Again one sees the
same basic physics in operation Gravity couples to everything thus when kinematics and
superselection rules permit the decay that decay will take place
The only hope for a stable massive remnant is if the decay is forbidden by a conservation
law For instance if the black hole is a magnetic monopole and if no ordinary particles
carry magnetic charge then the lowest mass black hole corresponding to a given magnetic
charge must be stable
D Dilatonic black holes
Consider a spinning charged axionic dilatonic black hole Such a black hole is a solu-
tion of the combined gravitational electromagnetic axion and dilaton equations of motion
The spin zero case has been discussed by Gibbons and Maeda 10 and more recently by
Garnkle Horowitz and Strominger 11 Further variations on the spin zero theme may
be found in references 1216 Generalizations to nonzero spin were rst explored by Horne
and Horowitz 17 and the complete solution worked out by Sen 18 The entropy of such
a black hole is
P cid261  Q22M 2 q1  Q22M 22  L2G2M 4cid27 
As a function of entropy and charge
One easily infers the mass spectrum
Sh2 
MN Z J2  m2
P  Z 2
ln1  N
JJ  1
ln1  N 
This class of black holes is in fact just as easy to analyse as the KerrNewman case Note
that J  Z  0 reproduces the Schwarzschild case that N  Z  J  0 is the vacuum
state and that N  0 with Z 6 0 6 J is forbidden As for the KerrNewman geometry
verifying that the mass gaps are desirably small is an exercise in tedious integer algebra
The discussion of the decay cascade may be carried over mutatis mutandis
IV DISCUSSION
In the absence of a reliable theory of fully quantized gravity the problem of dealing
with the nal stages of Hawking evaporation via an ab initio calculation appears to be
a completely hopeless task The arguments presented in this note seek to sidestep the
whole issue by developing a phenomenological particle physics based model for the Hawking
evaporation process The model developed herein adequately accounts for the Hawking
radiation process from heavy black holes  albeit with two free parameters that have to be
xed by comparison with Hawkings semiclassical calculation
Having obtained the model the model yields nite meaningful results even when extrap-
olated to small black holes The model rather strongly supports the notion that the nal
state of the Hawking radiation process is complete evaporation
It appears that from a
particle physics perspective the evaporation of a black hole can be plausibly tracked all the
way to the nal state without ever having to directly confront Planck scale physics Because
the model treats Hawking radiation as a cascade of quite ordinary particle physics decays
the model automatically preserves quantum coherence Any initially pure quantum state
will evolve to some pure but complicated nal state
Insofar as the ideas presented in this paper make any sense it now becomes absolutely
critical to face head on the question What exactly are the internal states of a black hole
