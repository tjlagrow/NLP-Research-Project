All natural language processing systems such as parsers generators taggers need to have
access to a lexicon about the words in the language This thesis presents a lexicon architecture
for natural language processing in Turkish Given a query form consisting of a surface form
and other features acting as restrictions the lexicon produces feature structures containing
morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic information for all possible interpretations of the
surface form satisfying those restrictions The lexicon is based on contemporary approaches
like feature-based representation inheritance and unication It makes use of two information
sources a morphological processor and a lexical database containing all the open and closed-
class words of Turkish The system has been implemented in SICStus Prolog as a standalone
module for use in natural language processing applications

Introduction
Natural language processing NLP is a research area under which the aim is to design and
develop systems to process understand and interpret natural language It employs knowledge
from various elds like articial intelligence in knowledge representation reasoning formal
language theory in language analysis parsing and theoretical and computational linguistics
in models of language structure
There are many applications of NLP such as translation of natural language text from one
language to another interfacing machines with speech or speech-to-speech translation natural
language interfaces to databases text summarization text preparation aids such as spelling
and grammar checkingcorrection etc
One of the rst applications of NLP is machine translation MT The research was funded by
military and intelligence communities These systems what we call rst generation translate
text almost word by word the result was a failure But considering the lack of theories
methods and resources with semantics and ambiguities in natural language text the result is
not surprising 4 1 Today with the advance of theories resources etc MT is not a dream
even there are MT systems available in the market
Many components of NLP systems like syntactic analyzers text generators taggers and se-
mantic disambiguators need knowledge about words in the language This information is stored
1 Consider the following well-known utterance
1 a Time ies like an arrow
b Fruit ies like a banana
The ambiguity in the sentences above can be resolved by utilizing the knowledge fruit ies is
a meaningful phrase but time ies is not However even today most systems cannot access
this kind of information
CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
in the lexicon which is becoming one of the central components of all NLP systems
In this thesis we designed and implemented a computational lexicon for Turkish to be employed
in an MT project which aims to develop scientic background and tools to translate computer
manuals from Turkish to English and vice versa see Figure 11 for a simplied architecture of
this system
A similar work for this project is the design and implementation of a verb lexicon for Turkish
by Ylmaz 16 This lexicon contains only verb entries to be utilized in syntactic analysis and
verb sense disambiguation
Our work aims to develop a generic lexicon for Turkish which can provide morphosyntactic
syntactic and semantic information about words to NLP systems The lexicon contains entries
for all lexical categories of Turkish with the information content also covering the Ylmazs
work The morphosyntactic information is not directly encoded in the lexicon rather obtained
through a morphological analyzer integrated into the system
The development of our work is carried out in two steps
1 determining the lexical specication for each of the lexical categories of Turkish that is
morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic phenomena to be encoded in the lexicon
2 developing a standalone system that will provide the encoded information to NLP systems
for a given input
In this thesis we present design and implementation of such a lexicon
The outline of the thesis is as follows In Chapter 2 we introduce the concept of lexicon with
examples from related work
In Chapter 3 we present a comprehensive categorization for
Turkish lexical types and associated lexical specication Next chapter gives the operational
aspects of our lexicon that is the interface of the system and algorithms used in producing the
result In Chapter 5 we go through the implementation of the system and give sample runs
Chapter 6 concludes and gives suggestions

The Lexicon
Lexicon is the collection of morphologicalmorphosyntactic syntactic and semantic information
about words in the language It has been a critical component of all NLP systems as they move
from toy system operating in demonstration mode to real world applications requiring wider
vocabulary coverage and richer information content
In this chapter we will rst briey introduce the concept of lexicon and the need for it Then
we will give the role of lexicon in NLP with specic examples from syntactic analysis and verb
sense disambiguation Finally we will present an example work which is on reaching a common
lexical specication in the lexicon among European languages
21 Lexicon
For a long time the lexicon was seen as a collection of idiosyncratic information about words in
the language As the requirements of NLP systems which perform various tasks ranging from
speech recognition to machine translation MT in wide subject domains grow those systems
need larger lexicons Even simple applications such as spelling checkers may require morpho-
logical orthographic phonological syntactic and semantic information for disambiguation
with realistic vocabulary coverage 1 For instance The Core Language Engine which is a
unication-based parsing and generation system for English has a lexicon containing 1800
senses of 1200 words and phrases 2 Thus the lexicon design and development has become
the one of the central issues for all NLP systems
There are two ways to develop the information content of a lexicon hand-crafting and use of
machine-readable resources The rst is the classical and costly way of developing the content
However there is a growing trend to use existing machine-readable resources such as electronic
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
dictionaries and text corpora to derive useful information Research in this area has yielded
signicant results in extracting morphosyntactic and syntactic information but the results in
semantic information side are not yet satisfactory 10
22 The Role of Lexicon in NLP
NLP systems need to access lexical knowledge about words in the language This information
can be morphosyntactic such as stem inectional and derivational suxes by means of list-
ing them explicitly or generation syntactic such as grammatical category and complement
structures and semantic such as multiple senses and thematic roles Depending on the NLP
task being performed other information can be utilized such as mapping between lexical units
and ontological concepts for transfer tasks in MT text planning information for generation
orthographic and phonological information for speech processing applications
In the following two sections we will describe the role of lexicon in syntactic analysis and verb
sense disambiguation
221 The Role of Lexicon in Syntactic Analysis
The following paragraph is taken from Zaenen and Uszkoreit 17 which briey describes text
analysis
We understand larger textual units by combining our understanding of smaller ones The main
aim of linguistic theory is to show how these units of meaning arise out of the combination of
the smaller ones This is modeled by means of a grammar Computational linguistics then
tries to implement this process in an ecient way It is traditional to subdivide the task into
syntax and semantics where syntax describes how the dierent formal elements of a textual
unit most often the sentence can be combined and semantics describes how the interpretation
is calculated
The grammar consists of two parts a set of rules describing how to combine small textual
units into larger ones and a lexicon containing information about those small units In recent
theories of grammar the rst part is reduced to one or two general principles and the rest of
the information is encoded in the lexicon
Now we will briey describe the analysis lexicon in KBMT-89 system 5 KBMT-89 is a
knowledge-based machine translation system in which source language text is analyzed into a
language independent representation namely interlingua and generated in the target language
There are two other methods used in MT other than interlingua method direct and transfer
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
method In the former one the source text is directly translated to target language almost
word by word with some arrangements however in the second one source text is analyzed
into an abstract representation which is then transfered into another abstract representation
for the target language and nally generated as the target language text Knowledge-based
MT requires more syntactic and semantic information so a larger and richer lexicon than the
other methods such as language independent knowledge-base for modeling the subworld of
translation etc
Knowledge acquisition in KBMT-89 is manual but aided with special tools so that partial
automation is achieved KBMT-89 uses three types of lexicon
1 concept lexicon which stores semantic information for parsing and generation
2 generation lexicon which contains information for the open-class words eg nouns which
accept new words in time in the target language in that special case it is Japanese
3 analysis lexicon which stores morphological and syntactic information word-to-concept
mapping rules and information for the mapping case role structures thematic roles to
subcategorization patterns
Each entry in the analysis lexicon contains the following information a word its syntactic
category inection root-word form syntactic features and mappings Syntactic features and
mappings can be specied locally or through inheritance by properly setting a pointer to a class
in the syntactic feature or structural mapping hierarchy
Here are two example entries from the English analysis lexicon for the verb and noun interpre-
tations of note

In the frame above rst three slots give the headword its category and word form that is
note verb and innitive respectively The next slot FEATURES gives the syntactic features by
inheriting the features of the class CAUS-INCHO-VERB-FEAT which are the features of causative-
inchoative verb class and adding other features locally such as valence root word form and
agreement marker in each of the three cases as arguments of OR The last slot MAPPING
gives word-to-concept mapping that is the verb note is mapped to the ontological concept
RECORD-INFORMATION in the concept lexicon and mapping of case role structures to subcatego-
rization patterns by inheriting from AG-TH-VERB-MAP class in the structural mapping hierarchy
which is the mapping for agent-theme verbs

The frame above states that the noun note is singular inherits all the syntactic features of the
class DEFAULT-NOUN-FEAT in addition to its local features for example its agreement marker
is 3sg it is countable and not a proper noun The MAPPING slot gives its mapping to the
entries in the concept lexicon that is note describes a mental content or a text group convey-
ing a communicative content It also inherits all the word-to-concept mappings of the class
OBJECT-MAP
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
222 The Role of Lexicon in Verb Sense Disambiguation
The second specic usage of the lexicon that we will describe is in verb sense disambiguation
specically for Turkish due to the work by Ylmaz 16
Verb is the most important component in the sentence it gives the predicate Thus resolving
lexical ambiguities concerning the verb is very important in syntactic analysis especially in
MT There are three kinds of lexical ambiguities
1 polysemy in which case a lexical item has more than one senses close to each other as in
para ye- cost a lot of money and kafay ye- get mentally deranged For example Turk
Dil Kurumu Dictionary gives 40 senses for the verb ck and 32 senses for the verb at
2 homonymy in which case the words have more than one interpretation having no obvious
relation among them eg vurul- has two interpretations fall in love with and be wounded
3 categorical ambiguity in which case the words have interpretations belonging to more
than one category as in ek noun appendixsux and verb sow
The claim in Ylmazs work is that by trying to match the morphological syntactic and
semantic information in the sentential context of a verb ie the information in its complements
with the corresponding information of the verb entries in the lexicon the correct interpretation
and sense of the verb can be determined For instance consider the following example
2 a Memur
para yedi
official money accept bribePAST3SG
The ocial accepted bribe
b Araba cok
para yedi
a lot of money costPAST3SG
The car costed a lot
In the sentences above the verb ye- is used in two dierent senses as accept bribe and cost a lot
The encoding in the lexicon for the rst sense states that the head of the direct objects noun
phrase is para with no possessive or case marking and the subject is human For the second
sense the head of the direct objects noun phrase is para and the subject is non-human By
applying those constraints the correct interpretation can be determined In the application of
semantic constraints however an ontology ie knowledge-base which describes the objects
events etc in a subject domain for nouns should be utilized for example in testing whether
memur is human or not
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
The lexicon consists of a list of entries for verbs Each entry is identied with its headword and
contains a list of argument structures in which there are the labels of the arguments morpho-
logical syntactic and semantic constraints and a list of senses associated with those argument
structures Each sense has another set of constraints specic for that sense and some descrip-
tive information such as semantic category mapping of thematic roles to subcategorization
patterns concept name etc
Below we provide the lexicon entry for the verb ilet- which has two argument structures
and three senses ie conduct convey and tell In order to save space we omit the second
argument structure and the last sense associated with it Here is the lexicon entry for ilet-

ALIAS-LIST 
In the rst argument structure there are subject and direct object The subject is optional
whereas the object is obligatory and nominative or accusative case-marked These are mor-
phological and syntactic constraints specied in MORPH and SYN slots of the arguments and no
other constraint is posed by this argument structure There are two senses associated with this
structure The rst poses a semantic constraint in CONST slot which requires that the direct
object must be an instance of POWER-ENERGY-PHYSICALOBJECT class like electricity or sound
Then it gives verb category which is process-action mapping of thematic roles to subcatego-
rization patterns which maps agent to subject and theme to direct object and concept name
which is to conduct with an example sentence The second sense does not pose any additional
constraint The verb category and thematic role mapping of this sense are the same with those
of the previous one Then the concept name is given as to convey with an example sentence
23 Example Work
Due to the growing needs of NLP systems for larger and richer lexicons the cost of designing
and developing lexicons with broad coverage and adequately rich information content is getting
high An example work which has developed such large lexical resources may be the Electronic
Dictionary Research EDR project Japan 1990 which run for 9 years costed 100 million
US dollars and intended to develop bilingual resources for English and Japanese containing
200000 words term banks containing 100000 words and a concept dictionary containing
400000 concepts Although the development is aided by special tools the actual eort is due
to the researchers themselves 1
In order to avoid such high costs the research institutions and companies are trying to combine
their eorts in developing publicly available large scale language resources which have adequate
information content and are generic enough multifunctional to satisfy various requirements
of wide range of NLP applications Examples of such eorts include ESPRIT BRA Basic
Research Action ACQUILEX aiming reuse of information extracted from machine-readable
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
dictionaries WordNet Project at Princeton which created a large network of word senses
related with semantic relations and LRE EAGLES Expert Advisory Group on Language
Engineering Standards project which tries to reach a common lexical specication at some
level of linguistic detail among European languages 6
In the rest of this section we will concentrate on the EAGLES project The information
given below is mainly received from Monachini and Calzolari 9 The objective of this work
is to propose a common set of morphosyntactic features encoded in lexicons and corpora in
European languages namely Italian English German Dutch Greek French Danish Spanish
and Portuguese
The project has gone through three phases
1 to survey previous work on encoding morphosyntactic phenomena in lexicons and text
corpora eg on MULTILEX and GENELEX models etc
2 to work on linguistic annotation of text and lexical description in lexicons to reach a
compatible set of features
3 to test the common proposal by applying concretely to European languages
The common set of features came after the completion of the second phase and is described in
three main levels corresponding to the level of obligatoriness
1 Level 0 contains only the part-of-speech category which is the unique obligatory feature
2 Level 1 gives grammatical features such as gender number person etc These are gener-
ally encoded in lexicons and corpora and called recommended features which constitute
the minimal core set of common features
3 Level 2 is subdivided into two
 Level 2a contains features which are common to languages but either not generally
encoded in lexicons and corpora or not purely morphosyntactic eg countability
for nouns These are considered as optional features
 Level 2b gives language-specic features
The multilayered description instead of a at one gives more exibility in choosing the level
detail in specication to match the requirements of applications As going down from Level
0 to Level 2 the description reaches ner granularity and the information encoded increases
Additionally this type of description helps to extend or update the framework
CHAPTER 2 THE LEXICON
The aim of the common proposal is not to pose a complete specication ready to implement
but to pose a basic set of features and to leave the rest to language-specic applications
The last phase of the project is the testing of the common proposal in a multilingual framework
namely the MULTEXT project The aim of MULTEXT partners is to design and implement a
set of tools for corpus-based research and a corpus in that multilingual framework The tasks
involved are developing a common specication for the MULTEXT lexicon and a tagset for
MULTEXT corpus The partners evaluated the common proposal at Level 1 recommended
features by also considering language-specic issues The result is that the common set of
features ts well to the description of partners but needs further language-specic detail
Chapter 3
A Lexicon Design for Turkish
All natural language processing systems such as parsers generators taggers need to access a
lexicon of the words in the language The information provided by the lexicon includes
 morphosyntactic
 syntactic and
 semantic information
In this thesis we have designed a comprehensive lexicon for Turkish and integrated it with a
morphological processor so that the overall system is capable of providing the feature structures
for all interpretations of an input word form with multiple senses incorporated
For instance consider the input word form kazma rst the morphological processor receives
this input and provides its analysis to the static lexicon There are three possible interpreta-
1 kazma noun pickaxe
2 kazNEG verb dont dig and
3 kazINF innitive digging
for which the static lexicon produces feature structures for all senses of the root words involved
Moreover the lexicon allows the interfacing system to constraint the output For example the
nal category feature of the root word in the input surface form can be restricted to say verb
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
In this case only information about the second interpretation dont dig will be released by the
system Chapter 4 describes this process in detail
By separating the system into two parts that is a morphological analyzer and a static lex-
icon we make use of the morphological processor previously implemented and abstract the
process of parsing surface forms Hence designing a static lexicon and interfacing it with the
morphological processor is sucient to construct a lexicon system
In this chapter we will present the detailed design of our static lexicon that is the associated
feature structures with each of the lexical categories in Turkish The procedural aspects ie
how feature structures are produced are described in Chapter 4 We will rst introduce the
main lexical categories then describe each one in detail with the associated feature structures
31 Lexicon Architecture
The Figure 31 briey describes the architecture of our lexicon which consists of a morphological
processor a static lexicon and a module applying restrictions
The input to the system is a query form which consists of two parts a word form and a set of
features placing constraints in the output The word form is rst received and processed by the
morphological processor whose output is the possible interpretations of the word form Then
the static lexicon attaches features to all senses of the root words of these interpretations and
outputs the feature structures But before the result is released the feature structures that do
not satisfy the restrictions are eliminated and the rest is the actual output of the system The
details of this procedure are given in Chapter 4
32 Lexical Representation Langugage
The lexical representation language that we will use in the rest of this chapter is feature struc-
tures A feature structures is a list of feature namefeature value pairs in which at most one
pair with a given feature name can be present The value of a feature name may be an atom
or a feature structure again Here are some examples of feature structures1
1 See Shieber 12 for a detailed description of feature structures

are depicted in Tables A1 and A2 on page 114

Each word in the lexicon has the following feature structure

Thus each word has category information in CAT feature as a 5-tuple describing major minor
and subcategories STEM and FORM as morphosyntactic features CONCEPT as semantic
fetaure and phonology The major and minor categories and the concept which uniquely
determine the word with its sense are given in this feature structure Additionally the form
which take lexical or derived values the stem and the phonology which is the combination of
the stem and inections are also present in this structure eg kitap book vs kitaplarm my
books

nominals are divided into three subcategories

the verbal forms derived using the suxes -mA -mAk -yHs -dHk and -yAcAk These will be
explained later in detail
The notation for suxes follows this convention A and H represent unrounded ie a e
and high vowels ie  i u u respectively The rst y in the suxes may drop

Third person singular and plural suxes are the possible values for the agreement marker of
nouns and sentential heads Pronouns may take rst second and third person singular and
plural agreement markers All three types of nominals may take possessive sux which is one
of the six person suxes and none
In the following sections we will describe the subcategories of nominals in detail
341 Nouns
Nouns denote the entities in the world such as objects events concepts etc As shown in
Figure 35 nouns can be further divided into two subcategories as common and proper nouns
These are described in detail in the next two sections


Figure 35 Subcategories of nouns
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
Common Nouns
Common nouns denote classes of entities Figure 36 depicts the two forms of common nouns
lexical and derived Only lexical common nouns are represented in our lexicon as lexical entries
however the system can produce feature structures for derived forms For example computa-
tion of the feature structure for evdekiler those that are at home requires the retrieval of the
feature structure of the noun ev home and the derivation of it to an adjective evdeki that is
at home and then to the noun evdekiler see the derivation tree for evdekiler in Figure 37

The semantic features may only take  or  values This is on the sense basis since senses may
have dierent semantic properties for example ekin culture is an abstract entity whereas ekin
crop is not The default value for the semantic features is 
The subcategorization information consists of a list of constraints on any complement of the
common noun The application of constraints is in disjunctive fashion This concept will be
extended to cover more than one complement eg subject objects etc in Section 37 when
the verb category is introduced Constraints on the complements of common nouns are of
three types category case and possessive markings and semantic properties Note that the
constraint structure for common nouns is simpler than that for verbs For instance constraint
structure for the current category does not constrain the stem and agreement features of the
arguments
In the next sections we will describe the two forms of common nouns in detail with examples
Lexical Common Nouns As mentioned above this form of common nouns are present in
the lexicon and the retrieval does not involve any computation of features The following are
examples of common nouns in lexical form kum sand kalem pencil ihtiyac need sabah
morning carsamba Wednesday ilkbahar spring asag bottom
As an example consider the common noun ihtiyac hisherits need as used in 33

The feature structure above gives the following information geceye is a common noun in lexical

countable and states temporality
Derived Common Nouns Derived forms of common nouns are not represented directly in
the lexicon However in order to produce feature structures the lexicon employs the derivation
information provided by the morphological processor This information mainly consists of the
target category and the derivational suxes The rest of the information such as argument
structure thematic roles concept and stem are supplied by the lexicon The details of this
process are described in Chapter 4
Each derived common noun has the following additional features
MORPH hDERV-SUFFIX derv-sux default nonei
hROLES roles default nonei
derived common
These give the sux used in the derivation and the semantic functions involved The latter
stores the thematic roles of the lexical verb which is involved somewhere in the derivation
process For example the derived common noun yazc writer has the thematic roles of the
verb yaz- write since the derivation process carries the thematic role information through
categories The type of this features value is given in Section 37
The derivation sux may take one of the following values -cH -cHk -lHk -yHcH -mAzlHk
-yAmAzHk -mAcA -yAsH and none
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
However there is the problem of predicting the semantic properties of derived common nouns
and this is not an easy task For example consider aksamc heavy drinker and oglenci the
student attending the afternoon session of a school which are both derived from common nouns
with the sux -cH The semantics is however rather unpredictable The current system does
not attempt to predict those values Instead the default values are used but these may not
necessarily be the correct values for the word in consideration Prediction of these values is
beyond the scope of our work
There are four types of derivation to derived common nouns
 Nominal derivation This type of derivation uses the suxes -cH -cHk -lHk as in the
examples kapc doorkeeper kitapck booklet and kitaplk bookcase
Consider the feature structure for the common noun tamircim my repairman as used
in the example sentence below

The feature structure for the noun tamircim is produced rst retrieving the features of
tamir repair and lling a template for derived common nouns appropriately Some
of the feature values are obtained from the features of tamir eg subcategorization
information some of them are supplied by the morphological processor eg inectional
and derivational suxes and the rest is provided by the static lexicon
The feature structure above gives the following information the word tamircim is a com-
mon noun derived from tamir with the sux cH and inected with 3sg and 1sg agreement
and possessive markers respectively Tamircim does not have subcategorization informa-
tion It also includes all the features of tamir
 Adjectival derivation Derivation from adjectival uses the sux -lHk eg iyilik good-
ness temizlik cleanliness But derivation without sux is also possible as in the
following examples though this is not productive
 borclu
that owing debt
 akll
intelligent
 geridekine
to the one behind
This is also possible in the case of participles compare with participles in Section 343
such as
 getirdigimi
the thing that I brought
 gelene
to the one that camecoming
As described in the section on qualitative adjectives this type of adjectivals are derived
from verbs and by dropping the head of the phrase that they modify and taking their
inectional suxes they become nominals An example is given in 8
8 a Buraya
gordun
hereDAT comePART manACC seePAST2SG QUES
Did you see the man that came here
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
b Buraya
gordun
hereDAT comePARTACC seePAST2SG QUES
Did you see the one that came here
In sentence 8a the verbal form of gapped relative clause buraya gelen acting as the
modier of adam man takes the inections of adam and functions as a nominal
There are two types of participles see Underhill 15
 subject such as gelen adam the man that cameis coming
 object such as getirdigim kitap the book that I brought
In order for an object participle to be used as a nominal specically common noun
the verb from which the adjectival is derived should take a direct object Otherwise the
nominal represents a fact For example the verb gel- come may not take a direct
object argument thus the nominal geldigini in 9a represents a fact In 9b however
the nominal getirdigini has two readings a fact and a derived common noun
9 a Tanerin
geldigini
biliyorum
TanerGEN comePARTP3SG knowPROG1SG
I know that Taner came
b Tanerin
getirdigini
biliyorum
TanerGEN bringPARTP3SG knowPROG1SG
I know that Taner brought something
I know the thing that Taner brought
 Verb derivation This derivation type uses the suxes -yHcH -mAcA -mAzlHk -yAmAzlHk
and -yAsH as used in the following example nouns yazc writer kosucu runner
kosusturmaca rushhurry cekememezlik envy kahrolas damnable
 Post-position derivation Derivation from post-positions do not use any sux eg azn
the one that is little yukarsna to the one that is above
Proper nouns
Proper nouns are used to refer to unique entities in the world The only additional feature that
proper nouns have states that they are always denite as in the examples Kurtulus Kemal
Oazer Bilkent and Ankara

CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
Indenite pronouns
Indenite and quantication pronouns denote entities without showing them explicitly The
dierence between the two is that quantication pronouns recall the existence of more than one

351 Determiners
Determiners are limiting adjectivals they specify entities by showing them explicitly or indef-
initely As shown in Figure 314 determiners are subdivided into three categories indenite
article demonstratives and quantiers which are described in the next sections

The only article in Turkish is bir as used in 17 As the name implies this article like
quantiers does not show entities explicitly The feature structure of this article is given

subcategories are described in the following sections
adjectives


quantitative
qualitative
Figure 315 Subcategories of adjectives
Quantitative Adjectives
Quantitative adjectives describe the amount of the entities This category is further divided
into four subcategories as shown in Figure 316
quantitative adjectives

PPPPPPPPP
cardinals
ordinals
fractions
distributives
Figure 316 Subcategories of quantitative adjectives
Cardinals Cardinals specify how many of entities are present The following are examples
of cardinals bir one iki two yuzlerce hundreds of kac how many
Ordinals Ordinals specify the rank of an entity The following are examples of ordinals
birinciilk rst ikinci second sonuncu last kacnc in what order
Fractions This category of quantitative adjectives specify the relative size of the parts of
an entity The following are examples of fractions butunvartamtum whole yarm half
ceyrek one fourth The following example demonstrates the fraction adjective usage of var
which may not be evident at the rst glance
Kazanmak icin var
gucumle
calstm

I word so hard to win
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
Distributives Birer one each is an example of distributives which gives the size of each
group that is obtained by dividing an entity into parts equally
Qualitative Adjectives
Qualitative adjectives describe the properties of the entities There are two forms of qualitative
adjectives lexical and derived In the next sections we will describe these forms in detail with
examples
Each qualitative adjective has the following additional feature which gives the subcategoriza-
tion information
qualitative adjcid20SYN hSUBCAT subcat default noneicid21
Lexical The feature structures of this form of adjectives are directly accessible in the lexicon
ie no derivation process is involved The subcategorization information for this form consists
of a list of constraints on the only if any complement of the adjective see the example below
The following are examples of qualitative adjectives in lexical form memnun pleased iyi
good zeki clever kucuk small ayn same ertesi next cok manymuch sar yellow
nasl how
Consider the feature structure for memnun pleased as used in 227
22 a Ondan memnun bir tek

There is no one worker who is pleased from him
b Olayn

We are not pleased from the way it develops
7 Note that the argument structure of memnun when used with the auxilary verb ol- is
dierent from that of the adjective usage Memnun ol- be happysatised is considered as a
separate compound verb see Section 37
mennun oldum

Derived Similar to other categories in derived form producing feature structures for derived
qualitative adjectives requires computation of features
Each derived qualitative adjective has the following additional features
DERV-SUFFIX derv-sux
MORPH 

hROLES roles default nonei
poss default none

derived qualitative adj
The derivation sux may take one of the following values -lHk -lH -ki -sHz -sH -yHcH -yAn
-yAcAk -dHk -yAsH and none The feature MORPH  POSS is used to hold the possessive
marking of adjective derived from verb as in bildigim yemek bildHkP1SG yemek dish that
I know Possible values for this feature are the six person suxes The last feature gives the
semantic roles of the verb which is involved in the derivation process
During the derivation process since predicting the gradability of the qualitative adjective is
dicult its default value ie it is  is used For example adjective aklsz stupid is gradable
while kolsuz without arm is not that is cok aklsz very stupid vs cok kolsuz However
the following prediction about the constraints on the complements of the derived qualitative
adjectives is generally correct qualitative adjectives are generally modiers of common nouns
and do not constrain the agreement and countability features of the modied
There are two possible derivations to qualitative adjectives
 Nominal derivation This derivation uses suxes -lHk -lH -ki -sHz -sH as in akll
intelligent evdeki that is at home and cocuksu childish
Consider the feature structure for the derived qualitative adjective akll intelligent as
used in the following sentence
Akll
insanlar boyle seyler
yapmazlar
inteligent people such thing3PL doNEGARST3PL

 Verb derivation This form of derivation uses the following suxes -yHcH -yAn -yAcAk
-dHk -yAsH and none Verbal form that take suxes -yAn -yAcAk -dHk and -yAsH
are in fact sentential heads of gapped sentences that dropped their subjects objects
or oblique objects to modify these dropped constituents These derivations produce two
types of participles according to the grammatical function of the dropped constituent
subject and object participles see Underhill 15
Derivations with -yAn and -yAsH may only produce subject participles as illustrated
in 24
24 a Kosede
tanyor

Do you know the man standing at the corner
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
b ovulesi
praisePART man
man deserving praise
c elleri
opulesi
hand3PL3SG kissPART woman
woman whose hands worth kissing
Derivations using -yAcAk may produce both types of participles whereas the ones with
-dHk may only produce object participles Consider example sentences in 25
25 a Paketi
cocuk henuz gelmedi
packetACC takePART boy
comeNEGPAST3SG
The boy who will take the packet has not come yet
b Gokhann okudugu
kitab
ben daha once
GokhanGEN readPART3SG bookACC I
okumustum
readNARRPAST1SG
I read the book that Gokhan is reading before
On the contrast the qualitative adjectives derived form verbal with -yHcH are not heads of
gapped sentences eg yazc printer Note that as used in tandk kisi known person
bildik biri known person and giyecek elbise dress to wear not all participles derived
using -dHk and yAcAk are heads of gapped sentences8 These are the idiomatic usages
of participles
Derivation without using a sux is also possible eg
 bilir
that cannot come
 okur yazar
that reads and writes
 donmus
that is frozen
8 Although the form predicative verbdHk is not productive ie only some of the verbs
may conform to it its negated form is generally applicable to all predicative verbs as used in
the following
26 a

CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
Only object participles derived using -dHk and -yAcAk take possessive sux since the
subject may be missing in the subordinate clause see the following example
Consider the feature structure for bilmedigim that I dont know as used in 289

This section describes the representation of adverbials in our lexicon These are words that
modify or add to the meaning of verbs and verbal forms adjectives and adverbials in various
ways eg direction manner temporality etc see Ediskun 3 As depicted in Figure 317
adverbials are divided into ve subcategories whose details are given in Figure 318

362 Temporal Adverbs
Temporal adverbs specify the point of time and limit the period of states actions and processes
As shown in Figure 319 temporal adverbs comprise point-of-time and time-period adverbs
temporal adverbs

Figure 319 Subcategories of temporal adverbs
Point-of-Time Adverbs
There are two forms of point-of-time adverbs lexical and derived The following two sections
describe these with examples
Lexical The following are point-of-time adverbs in lexical form dun yesterday bugun to-
day simdi now demin a moment ago once before onceden beforehand
Derived This form of adverbs are derived from verbs using suxes -yHp and -yHncA The
derivation with -yHp produces adverbs that state a subordinate action that happens simulta-
neously or in sequence with the main action in the sentence The other type of adverbs state
an action that happens in sequence with the main action Consider the following examples
30 a Bu
soruyu
anlayp
cozmek

It is rst needed to understand the topic and then to solve this question
aksam kitap okuyup
dinlenecektim10
this evening book readADV restFUTPAST1SG
This evening I was going to read a book and rest
In the rst sentence the adverb anlayp states a subordinate action that is performed before
the main action In the latter one however the two actions happen simultaneously
Each derived point-of-time adverb has the following additional features which give the deriva-
tion sux subcategorization information and thematic roles of the verb involved in the deriva-

Time-Period Adverbs
As Figure 320 shows time-period adverbs are subdivided into three categories fuzzy day-time
and season adverbs
Fuzzy There are two forms of fuzzy time-period adverbs lexical and derived In the following
two sections we will describe these forms with examples
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
time-period adverbs


day-time
Figure 320 Subcategories of time-period adverbs
Lexical The following are examples of this form of fuzzy time-period adverbs dakikalarca

Derived This form of adverbs are derived form verbs using the suxes -yAlH and -ken as
 sen geleligideli
since the time you arrivedwent
 biz gelirken
while we are coming
Each derived fuzzy time-period adverb also has the following features The derivation sux
is one of -yAlH and -ken The other features give subcategorization information and semantic
roles of the verb which are involved in the derivation process

period adverbs
363 Manner Adverbs
Manner adverbs describe the way and how actions processes and states develop As depicted
in Figure 321 manner adverbs are divided into two subcategories as qualitative and repetition
adverbs which are described next in detail

Repetition Manner Adverbs
As the name implies this category of manner adverbs add repetition to the semantics of the
verb and verbal forms There are two forms of repetition manner adverbs which are lexical
and derived
Lexical Tekrar again gene again sk frequently are some examples of this form
Derived The derivation to this form is only from verbs and uses the sux -dHkcA as in
 sen geldikce
as you come

Sentential adverbs can only modify verbs and verbal forms The following are some examples of
sentential adverbs evet yes yok no oyle so elbette certainly gercekten really daima

37 Verbs
This section describes the representation of verbs in our lexicon with an emphasis on argument
structures and thematic roles Verb is the head of sentence hence it is the most important
constituent It describes a state action or process 16 As shown in Figure 323 verbs are
divided into three categories as predicative existential and attributive verbs


predicative
existential
attributive
Figure 323 Subcategories of verbs
Each verb in the lexicon has the following additional features which represent morhosyntactic
syntactic and semantic information none is the default value for all of the features
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH

There are four morphosyntactic features introduced see Solak and Oazer 13 The MORPH  SENSE
feature species whether the verb states a positive or negative predicate attribute etc There
are four possible tenses for attributive and existential verbs which are also the possible second
tenses for predicative verbs present denite past narrative past and conditional forms This
information is specied in MORPH  TAM2 feature The feature MORPH  COPULA gives
the usage of the sux -dHr which states probability or deniteness The last one represents
the person sux whose possible values are rst second and third person singular and plural
persons
The subcategorization information which we will describe later in detail gives the valence of
the verb for the active voice12
12 There are cases in which the passive or causative voice of the verb gives a dierent sense
than the active voice In those cases representation is congured accordingly eg

CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
The feature SEM  ROLES describes the thematic roles of the arguments of the verb These
role llers are the following see Ylmaz 16
 agent
 experiencer
 theme
 patient
 causer
 accompanier
 recipient
 goal
 source
 instrument
 value designator
 beneciary
 location
The subcategorization information is given as a list of elements each one describing an argument
of the verb in question Each such description consists of three features
SYN-ROLE
syn-role
OCCURRENCE obligatoryoptional


CONSTRAINTS nconstraint1     constraintj     constraintmo
The feature SYN-ROLE gives the argument type which is one of the following
 subject
 direct object
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
 agentive object
 oblique objects dative ablative locative
 instrumental object
 beneciary object
 value designator
The second feature describes whether the occurrence of the argument is obligatory or optional
The last feature gives a list of constraints on the argument in consideration
Elements in the subcategorization list are co-indexed with corresponding thematic role llers
according to the verb in consideration ie there is a mapping from grammatical functions to
thematic roles For example direct object is generally co-indexed with patient or theme
The types of constraint structures are dierent for subject and direct oblique and agentive
objects instrumental object value designator and beneciary object Each structure will be
described in turn
 Constraint structures for subject direct oblique and agentive objects The type of con-
straint structures for subject direct oblique and agentive objects is given below This
feature structure gives constraints on the category which is nominal in the most general
case a number of morphosyntactic and semantic properties of the argument

constraintj


SSSUB sssub
STEM stem
CASE case

nominal


The subject never takes a case marking ie it is in nominative case There are cases
that morphosyntactic features other than the case should be constrained as well as
illustrated below
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
37 a Istanbulu
sel ald
IstanbulACC be floodedPAST3SG
Istanbul is ooded
b C ocuk kafay yedi
get mentally derangedPAST3SG
The boy got mentally deranged
In 37a in addition to the case the stem and the possessive marker are required to be
sel and none respectively
In the second sentence however the requirements are the
following the stem of the direct object is kafa it has accusative case and 3sg agreement
markers and it is not possessive-marked
Semantic constraints can also be posed in these structures For example the verb sense
kafay ye to get metally deranged requires the subject to be human
The direct object may be in nominative or accusative cases while oblique objects are in
dative ablative and locative cases
The agentive object is in ablative case and its stem is taraf with a suitable possessive
marker An example sentence is given in 38
bizim tarafmzdan cozuldu
problem usGEN by

The problem is solved by us
 Constraint structrures for instrumental object The following are the constraint structures
for the instrumental object There are two possible types for this argument The rst type
is for nominals which are instrumental case-marked The second is for post-positional
phrases whose heads are the post-position ile13

 Constraint structures for value designator There are two forms in a sentence to describe
a value designator The rst form uses a nominal which is dative case-marked The
second uses a post-positional phrase whose head is icin as used in 3914
Oralarda
10 dolar icin adam olduruler
thereLOC 10 dolar for man
killARST3PL
They will kill you for 10 dollars there
Thus the two feature structures that are introduced for instrumental object can be used
for the value designator by replacing the values of case stem and the minor category
features with dative icin and nom-subcat respectively
 Constraint structures for beneciary object The feature structure below is for the bene-
ciary object which is a post-positional phrase whose head is the post-position icin
MAJ post-position
MIN nom-subcat 
MORPH hSTEM icini

Furthermore the oblique object case-marked as dative can be mapped to the beneciary
as depicted in the following example
Annesi
cocuga uyumadan
kitap okudu
motherP1SG boyDAT sleepINFABL before book readPAST3SG
His mother read book for the boy before he slept
As mentioned above the subcategorization information for verbs in lexical form is given as a
list in which each element gives constraints on an argument of the verb in consideration Since
the members of other categories in lexical form such as common nouns qualitative adjectives
and post-positions cannot have more than one argument just the constraint lists for one
complement are given
In the following sections we will describe the subcategories of verbs in detail
14 This example is due to Ylmaz 16
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
371 Predicative Verbs
Predicative verb category comprises the verbs that are not existential or attributive There are
two forms of predicative verbs which are lexical and derived These forms are described in the
next sections
Each predicative verb has the following additional morphosyntactic features

predicative verb

default 
RECIPROCAL 
default 
REFLEXIVE
default 
CAUSATIVE
default 0
PASSIVE
posneg
default none
default none


The rst tense-aspect-mood marker is specied in MORPH  TAM1 feature for which there are
ten possible values present denite past narrative past future aorist progressive conditional
optative necessitative and imperative If the verb is a compound one the compounding sux is
given in MORPH  COMP feature whose value is one of -yAbil -yHver -yAdur -yAkoy -yAkal
and -yAyaz The last four features represent the voice of the verb The value n represents a
positive integer number which denotes the level of causation see Solak and Oazer 13
Lexical
This form of predicative verbs are present in the lexicon as lexical entries mainly consisting of
subcategorization information and thematic roles The following are example predicative verbs
in lexical form
 ye-
 ic-
 gor-
eat
drink
see
 hediye et-
give present
 kafay ye-
get mentally deranged
 rusvet ye-
receive bribe
Some of the predicative verbs consist of more than one word eg kafay ye- get mentally
deranged rezil et- disgrace rezil ol- be disgraced kavga et- quarrel some of which are
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
constructed with the auxiliary verbs et- and ol- The verbs whose rst constituents are not
nominals are taken as separate compound verbs whereas there are two cases for the ones whose
rst constituents are nominals In the rst case such constituents are not subject to inections
as in 42a
42 a Biz yine de hediyemizi
ederiz
anyway present1PLACC doARST1PL
b Biz gerekirse
kavgamz
ederiz
we if needed fight1PLACC doARST1PL
If needed we will ght
This type of verbs are taken separately as compound verbs In the latter case as in 42b such
constituents are subject to inection which are taken as a dierent sense of the main verb and
the rst constituent is given as an object in the argument structure For example kavga et-
quarrel is represented as a sense of et- and kavga quarrel is the direct object of this sense
We will give feature structures for four senses of the verb ye- which are the following
1 eat something
2 eat from something
3 get mentally deranged
4 be unfair
The following is the feature structure for the rst sense eat something as used in 43

direct object in the former one whereas it is the oblique object in ablative case in the latter
Note that the second sense does not subcategorize for a direct object

38 Conjunctions
This section describes the representation of conjunctions in our lexicon Conjunctions are
function words ie they do not convey meaning when used alone They are used to conjoin
words phrases and sentences both syntactically and semantically see Ediskun 3 As shown
in Figure 324 conjunctions are divided into three subcategories coordinating bracketing and
sentential conjunctions
The next three sections describe the subcategories of conjunctions with examples

39 Post-positions
This section describes the representation of post-positions in our lexicon Like conjunctions
post-positions are function words ie they do not have meaning unless they are used with
nominals in order to construct post-positional phrases see Ediskun 3 As shown in Fig-
ure 325 post-positions are subdivided into six categories according to their subcategorization
types specically the case of the complement
post-positions
nominative
accusative
ablative
genitive
instrumental
Figure 325 Subcategories of post-positions
Each post-position also has the following feature which gives the subcategorization information
for only one argument in contrast to the case in verbs which accept a number of arguments
CHAPTER 3 A LEXICON DESIGN FOR TURKISH
such as subject direct object etc For this reason the subcategorization information of post-
positions consists of just a list of constraints for only one argument

Operational Aspects of the
Lexicon
Our lexicon provides necessary morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic information to NLP
subsystems performing syntactic analysis tagging semantic disambiguation etc
The whole system consists of three main parts
1 a morphological processoranalyzer
2 a static lexicon and
3 a module ltering the output according to the users restrictions
As depicted in Figure 41 the system receives a query form which includes at least a surface
form and other information acting as the restrictions on the output feature structures The
surface form is rst directed to the morphological processor which generates all possible in-
terpretations ie parses or lexical forms and forwards these to the static lexicon The static
lexicon accesses feature structure database and retrieves syntactic and semantic information for
the root words involved in the interpretations Having unied the morphosyntactic information
provided with corresponding syntactic and semantic information retrieved the static lexicon
outputs a list of feature structures The nal step in the process is the elimination of the feature
structures which do not satisfy the users restrictions
In this way the NLP subsystems using the lexicon do not need to interface with the morpholog-
ical processor to obtain interpretations rather they just provide the surface form and receive
the corresponding feature structures containing morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic in-
formation
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
In this chapter we will rst describe the interface to the lexicon Section 42 describes how the
system produces feature structures step by step by giving examples and Section 43 mentions
problems and limitations related with this task
41 Interfacing with the Lexicon
We presented many examples of feature structures in Chapter 3 and will describe the method
of producing those feature structures in the next section
In this section we will mainly
concentrate on how NLP subsystems can use our lexicon
Our lexicon is a front end for a morphological analyzer Given a surface form with restriction
features it generates all the morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic information for this
surface form that is it abstracts morphological analysis and associates syntactic and semantic
information with each interpretation see Figure 42
The interface described above can be used by a syntactic analyzer for Turkish Additionally
taggers and word sense disambiguators can employ our lexicon Taggers need to set necessary
constraints which are generally on category and morphosyntactic features in the query form
Consider the following example
58 a evin
kaps
houseGEN doorP3SG
door of the house
b senin
youGEN houseP2SG
your house
In the two noun phrases above the surface form evin exists with two dierent interpretations
in the rst one it is genitive case-marked and singular with no possessive marking whereas in
the second one it is nominative case-marked with 2sg possessive marking The ambiguity can
be resolved with the help of morphological features ie case or possessive markings
Word sense disambiguation is also possible by making use of semantic features in the feature
structures For example the two senses of the root word kazma stupid person and pickaxe can
be resolved by setting the SEM  ANIMATE feature in the query form properly Adding seman-
tic features increases the accuracy of word sense disambiguation process However rather than
adding arbitrary semantic features on demand constructing an ontology describing concepts
via a semantic network would be more useful

Text generators for Turkish or transfer units to Turkish in machine translation systems can also
make use of our lexicon to obtain information about root words However the SEM  CON-
CEPT feature may not be directly usable by transfer units since the English denition in this
feature is mostly human oriented
The input query form is basically a feature structure which contains two types of information
a surface form and a set of other features The surface form guides the system in producing
the feature structures that is it is the actual input for the output of the lexicon It is specied
as the phonology information the PHON feature in the query form The rest of the features
are optional and act as restrictions on the output structures In fact the query form subsumes
each of the actual output feature structures Any set of features can be specied in the query
form provided that they are consistent and appropriate for the intended structure
The process of eliminating or ltering the output feature structures that do not satisfy the
restrictions in the query form is the last step in the whole process
Consider the following query form placing morphosyntactic and semantic restrictions on the
surface form ekimde that is the root word should not be possessive-marked and its semantics
should state temporality

2 ekimde in my appendixsux The second interpretation is also a lexical common noun
for which there are two senses in the static lexicon appendix and sux Feature structures
for both of the senses are similar so we will consider only the rst one appendix which
is used in the following sentence

Due to the  value of SEM  TEMPORAL and 1sg value of MORPH  POSS features
the subsumption of the feature structure above with the query form will fail and it will
be eliminated Note that both of the restriction features are appropriate for the feature
structures above
42 Producing Feature Structures
We will describe the processing in the lexicon as consisting of three main steps
1 morphological analysis
2 retrieval of syntactic and semantic information and unication with morphosyntactic
information
3 application of restrictions
The rst step is external to the system so we will consider only its inputoutput interface
The second step consists of transformation of morphological parses to feature structure syn-
tax category mapping retrieval from static lexicon and computing features according to the
morphological parses The nal step is relatively simple it just tests the sumbsumtion of input
query form with each of the produced structures
In the next sections we will examine each step and provide details with examples
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
421 Morphological Analysis
Morphological processor provides possible interpretations of a surface form Due to the rich set
of inectional and derivational suxes in Turkish it is highly probable that the surface form
will have more than one interpretation Consider the possible interpretations of the surface
form kazma for which the morphological processor output is given in Figure 43 as used in the
following examples
61 a Dun

Figure 43 Interpretations of the surface form kazma
The rst interpretation contains the noun reading pickaxe The second and third interpreta-
tions consider the verb kaz- dig In the second interpretation the sux ma is an inectional
sux and negates the predicate as opposed to the other one which is a derivational sux and
used to derive the innitive kazma digging
As seen in the example above the rich set of inectional and derivational suxes causes many
interpretations which increase in number when the multiple senses are incorporated For
example the predicative verb ye has at least four senses which we mentioned in Section 371
The morphological processor output must be transformed to feature structure syntax moreover
due to the comprehensive categorization introduced in Chapter 3 category mapping will take
place The following section describes this transformation and retrieving information in the
static lexicon
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
422 Retrieving Information in the Static Lexicon
The static lexicon follows the interpretations produced by the morphological processor In-
terpretations include category information the root words and a number of inectional and
derivational suxes such as case and possessive markers The retrieval step mainly consists of
the following phases
 transformation of interpretations into feature structure syntax and correct mapping from
the morphological processor category to the static lexicon category
 accessing the feature structures of the root words involved in the morphological parses
and computing features accordingly
During the processing the system accesses two tables and two databases The tables are used
to map category information and the databases are used to access feature structures of the root
words containing syntactic and semantic information ie lexical database and the template
structures
The retrieval process starts with transformation of parses into feature structure syntax since the
syntactic and semantic information is stored in the form of feature structures in the static lexi-
con As seen in the interpretations of kazma in the previous section derivations exist in morpho-
logical parses and may go to arbitrary depth such as C ekoslovakyallastramadklarmzdanmssnz
As another example for the interpretations containing derivations consider the one in Fig-
ure 44 It starts with the noun akl intelligence which is used to derive the adjective akll
intelligent The derivations end with the manner adverb akllca intelligently The deriva-
tions in the processor output are highlighted with the CONV item in the string below which
gives the category and derivational sux Thus in the following example there are two deriva-
tions and three categories traversed that is there are three levels the rst is the lexical level
and the other two are the derivational levels Each level is transformed into a feature structure
containing category and morphosyntactic information So the interpretation above would be
transformed into a list of levels with three elements
CATNOUNROOTakIlCONVADJLICONVADVERBCATYPEMANNER
Figure 44 The derivation path to the manner adverb akllca
While transforming the interpretations the system maps the category information in the mor-
phological processor output to correct lexicon category for all levels which is due to the ner-
grained categorization of the lexicon For this purpose two tables are maintained for root words
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
and derivations respectively For the rst one processor category and root word uniquely de-
termine the lexicon category For each root word represented in the feature structure database
an entry in this table must be present A portion of such a table for nouns is depicted in Fig-
ure 45 For the second table processor category and derivational sux uniquely determine
the lexicon category This mapping is given in Table 41
Processor category Root word
Lexicon category
common noun

kaznt
kazmanoglu proper noun
ketcap
kurtulus

Figure 45 A portion of the table used for category mapping for root words
This step is applied to all of the morphological parses and at the end of this step for each
parse there is a list of levels each of which contains the correct lexicon category and a set of
features representing morphosyntactic information of interpretations
The next phase in the processing is the retrieval of the syntactic and semantic information and
producing feature structures The syntactic and semantic information about the root words is
stored in the feature structure database which is indexed with the category and the root word
information For the root words in the lexical levels of each parse the feature structure database
is accessed and matching entries are retrieved However the entries contain only syntactic and
semantic information for the non-derived forms thus morphosyntactic information needs to be
unied and by following the derivation information of parses new feature structures should be
constructured Many examples of this phenomenon are presented in the Chapter 3
Since the morphological parses are previously transformed into feature structure syntax uni-
cation of morphosyntactic information is simple Having unied all the information the pro-
cessing for the lexical level is completed If the morphological parses do not contain a derivation
to another category the process above is sucient to produce the result However as we have
already mentioned the cases in which derivations exist are not rare
For each derivation in the parses a new feature structure is constructed For this purpose using
the category information in the derivational levels the template feature structure database is
accessed and corresponding template feature structures are retrieved These structures do not
contain feature values but they will be computed by the system

Table 41 The table used for category mapping for derived words
Starting from the leftmost derivational level the derivation path is followed for each derivation
a new feature structure is constructed feature values are computed The result is a nested
feature structure in which the previous structures are stored in MORPH  STEM feature as
shown in Figure 46
Having retrieved the template feature structure the feature values are to be computed by the
system Morphosyntactic information is already produced by the morphological processor and
unied with the information in the template structures A feature structure belonging to any
category should has the following minimum information category phonology stem concept
and form Among them the category information and the form ie it is derived are already
known The feature MORPH  STEM holds the feature structures of the previous words as
described above The phonology information is valid only in the last feature structure in the
derivation whose value is the surface form given as the input to the morphological processor1
The concept feature is computed by means of a function according to the target derivation
category and sux
1 In other structures this value is undened although computation is possible by means of
morphological generation

Figure 46 Nested feature structures
There are other features to be computed other than the common ones among which subcate-
gorization information and thematic roles are the most important ones These are co-indexed
with the those of the previous derivational level Furthermore a number of features specic
to some categories exist eg semantic properties of common nouns or the constraints on the
modied of qualitative adjectives About the second one for example the following prediction
can be made qualitative adjectives modify the common nouns and do not constrain the agree-
ment and countability features However predicting the semantic properties is dicult and
for this reason the default values are used which may not always give the correct description
In the next section we will clarify the procedure above by giving examples
Examples
In summary the process of producing feature structures follows the following steps
1 For each parse in the morphological processor output do the following
11 Find the lexicon category of the initial root word see the table in Figure 45
12 Find the lexicon entries of all senses of the root word by matching the root word
information
13 Unify morphosyntactic information with the information in the lexicon entryentries
14 While there is derivation in the parse do the following
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
141 Find the lexicon category and retrieve the corresponding template feature struc-
ture see Table 41
142 Compute feature values and unify morphosyntactic information
15 Output the feature structures
We will describe the process with the input surface form kazma which has three interpretations
one of which includes a derivation see example 61 and Figure 43 for morphological processor
output
1 Kazma common noun This interpretation is due to the common noun kazma pickaxe
and does not contain a derivation so the result can be easily produced by combining
morphosyntactic syntactic and semantic information
As we already described the process starts with determining the lexicon category The
morphological processor categorizes kazma just as a noun however it is represented as
a common noun in the static lexicon Then the corresponding feature structure in the
lexicon is searched by matching the ROOT information of morphological processor with
MORPH  STEM feature of lexicon entries The matching feature structure is given
below Note that there is only one sense of kazma pickaxe in our lexicon

2 Kazma verb This interpretation comes from the verbal root kaz- dig The sux ma
is an inectional sux which negates the meaning see Figure 43 for the parse Since
no derivation step is involved the process is similar to that of the common noun reading

previous two examples The derivation step starts with the determination of the target

indexed with the corresponding entries in the lexicon entry of kaz- The concept feature
is computed via a function The rest of the features can be easily found since category
is already known and morphosyntactic information is received from the morphological
processor The phonology feature takes the input surface form kazma

423 Application of Restrictions
The nal step in the process is the elimination of the feature structures that do not satisfy the
restrictions
The input to this phase is a list of feature structures and the users query form Each structure
is tested against the query form for subsumtion relation that is all of the features in the query
form must be present in the output structures and the feature values must be the same The
ones that fail to satisfy this relation are eliminated
The process is relatively simple thus we will not decribe it any further see the example in
Section 41
43 Problems and Limitations
A limitation with the representation of the entries in the static lexicon is related with the
SEM  CONCEPT feature which gives a brief English description of the object event etc
that the root word represents The description is mostly human-oriented and not directly
usable by NLP subsystems such as transfer units from Turkish to English and vice versa in
machine translation systems For example this feature may take the value throw a physical
object for the verb at- Using an ontological component in the lexicon eliminates this problem
in which concepts would be described via a semantic network
Another problem that the ontological component would eliminate is the following the subcate-
gorization information for verbs common nouns etc may places some semantic constraints on
the complements such as the agent of the verb ye- eat something must be animate SEM  AN-
IMATE is  This constraint would be tested with the semantic feature in the feature structure
of the subject during syntactic analysis This test however may fail due to the absence of the
feature SEM  ANIMATE but this structure may describe a human such as ogrenci student
having SEM  HUMAN so satisfying animateness constraint This syntactic mismatch of the
features would be eliminated easily since a human object would inherit animateness property
see Ylmaz 16 for such a component in a verb lexicon
One of the problems with producing feature structures especially with the derivations involved
is predicting semantic properties of common nouns and qualitative adjectives
In the other
categories either semantic properties are not introduced or they do not receive derivation
Since the new word generated as a result of the derivation process does not have a lexicon entry
the process should predict some feature values However the semantics of the object or the
quality that the derivation process produces is not clear For example consider the derivation
that takes a common noun and the sux c and produces a common noun Both aksamc and
CHAPTER 4 OPERATIONAL ASPECTS OF THE LEXICON
oglenci are produced in this way however the semantic properties of the resultant entities are
not predictable This is the case in yazc yaz- writec which has two senses printer and
the person who writes The two senses have dierent properties eg animateness
A similar situation occurs for the qualitative adjectives For instance as we stated previously
the gradability of derived forms are not quite predictable cok aklsz vs cok kolsuz
Chapter 5
Implementation
The processing in the lexicon consists of four main steps each carried out by a separate module
1 morphological analysis
2 transformation of morphological processor output to static lexicon the syntax ie feature
structure syntax and category mapping
3 retrieval from feature structure databases and producing feature structures
4 application of restrictions
Except the morphological processor component1 which is previously implemented all the com-
ponents are implemented in SICStus Prolog release 3 5 14 Since we described the procedural
aspects of the lexicon in Chapter 4 we will not go into the details of this process however there
is one point to be made here in the implementation the query form can contain features only
from CAT and MORPH since the lexicon interface does not gain much by adding the capabil-
ity of restricting SYN and SEM features as well On the other hand NLP subsystems using
this interface can impose any restriction externally because access to all features is allowed
So rather than applying restrictions to eliminate unwanted feature structures as the nal step
the system applies restrictions to parses right after the transformation phase ie when the
CAT and MORPH features are computed Thus unnecessary retrievals and computations are
avoided
We provided a procedural interface for the lexicon rather than implementing a graphical one
since the interface will be open to NLP subsystems in practical applications

CHAPTER 5
IMPLEMENTATION
In this chapter we will rst describe an important component of the system the feature
structure database ie the root word lexicon Then we will give outputs from sample runs
of the system
51 Feature Structure Database
The feature structure database consists of a list of feature structures indexed with category and
root word Each word and sense is a separate entry in the database so given a category and
root word more than one entry may match that is the key is not unique Each entry is a unit
Prolog clause with seven arguments the rst ve ones giving the category and the other two
giving the root word and the corresponding feature structure see Figure 51 In this way the
database can be stored in the main memory and allows fast access
fsdbverb existential none none none var
catmajverb  syn 
Figure 51 The entry for the existential verb var in the feature structure database
Feature structures are represented as a list of feature namefeature value pairs see Gazdar
and Mellish 4 For example the following feature structure with abstract representation
would be represented in Prolog as in Figure 52

Figure 52 Prolog representation of a feature structure
Currently our feature structure database contains about 50 entries which consists of samples
from the closed-class words such as post-positions conjunctions and from other categories
showing some special property More entries will be added to the system later In order to
maintain the database the system provides a number of predicates to add delete and browse
entries
CHAPTER 5
IMPLEMENTATION
52 Sample Runs
In this section we will present three sample runs that will demonstrate features of our lexicon
and will clarify the algorithms presented in Chapter 4
The input to the system is a query form in the form of a feature structure At least the PHON
feature which holds the surface form must be present in the query form Other features are
optional and if present they act as restrictions on the nal output feature structures The user
can test presence of a feature or a specic value for that feature If the feature restricted is in the
output feature structure the restriction value which may be unspecied to test the presence
is unied with the one in the output structure If the unication fails the output structure is
eliminated If such a feature is not in the output structure the restriction feature would not be
appropriate for this structure so it is again eliminated for example MORPH  TAM1 feature
is not appropriate for a conjunctions feature structure
As previously mentioned the process is divided into four phases in the implementation All
four phases inform the user about the state of the processing The nal output is a list of
feature structures which satisfy all the constraints
521 Example 1
The rst example submits only the surface form atm and does not constrain any other features
According to the morphological processor atm has three parses as illustrated by the following
examples
62 a Benim bir atm
a horseP1SG existent
I have a horse
b Kuheylan ben bir atm
Kuheylan I
a horsePRES1SG sayPAST3SG
Kuheylan said that it was a horse
c Tilki bir atm mesafedeydi
fox one shot distancePAST3SG
The fox was in one shot distance
The category of the surface form atm is common noun and attributive verb respectively in
the rst two parses and they are due to the common noun at horse The third parse comes
from the common noun atm shot and does not derive to another category Since query form

does not place any constraint the system will generate output for all of the parses as far as

The output is a trace of the four phases The rst part is the morphological parsing and
displays parses The second part is the transformation of parses into static lexicon syntax
ie feature structure syntax and category mapping The rst item in the output of this
phase shows the mapping of the morphological processor category noun to the lexicon category
common noun for the root word at The next two output items illustrate category mapping of
CHAPTER 5
IMPLEMENTATION
the second parse The last item shows that the category mapping table for root words does not
have an entry for atm that is the system does not have information about atm so this parse
is omitted and will not be processed in the following phases
After the transformation phase two parses remain and since no restriction is imposed by the
user these parses will pass to the next phase The retrieval part acknowledges the user that
it accessed the feature structure database entry of the common noun at two times and the
template feature structure for attributive verbs which is due to the derivation in the second
Each parse produces only one feature structure because the common noun at has only one en-
trysense in the database The nal output is these feature structures The processing including
interfacing with the morphological processor producing feature structures and pretty-printing
takes approximately 30 msec of running time for compiled Prolog code so it is rather fast As
we mentioned in Chapter 2 the number of lexical items in a lexicon of a system with acceptable
coverage eg The Core Language Engine will not exceed a few thousand so whole database
can be stored in the main memory Thus as the size of our lexical database gets larger the
processing time will not exceed acceptable limits
522 Example 2
This example run submits the surface form memnunum to the system and constraints the
output to be of category verb Given this surface form morphological processor gives three
parses as used in the following examples3
63 a Senden memnunum
youGEN happyPRES1SG
I am happy with you
b Memnunum
happy oneP1SG my
c Ben Memnunum
MemnunPRES1SG
I am Memnun
The rst two parses are due to the qualitative adjective memnun satisedhappy and contain
derivations to attributive verb and common noun respectively The last one is due to the
3 The usage in the second sentence is like in guzelim benim that is the qualitative adjective
guzel beautiful is subject to a derivation to common noun and becomes the one that is beautiful
This usage of Memnun is syntacticly correct though semantically it does not make sense
CHAPTER 5
IMPLEMENTATION
proper noun Memnun and contains a derivation to attributive verb The only restriction in
the query form is that the output feature structures must be of type verb which will cause the
second parse to be eliminated in the third phase

In the transformation of parses no entry regarding the proper noun Memnun is found in the
category mapping table so this parse is eliminated leaving two parses to the third phase which
discards the second parse since it fails to satisfy the restriction that is the value of CAT  MAJ
must be verb Finally there is only one parse left which is the rst one as an input to the
retrieval phase As seen in the output there is only one entry for the qualitative adjective
memnun thus only one feature structure is generated The processing takes approximately 50
msec of running time The values of SUBCAT and MODIFIES features are omitted to save
space see the full feature structure of memnun on page 40
523 Example 3
Our last example will demonstrate multiple senses in the database The surface form is ekim
and the restriction is on MORPH  POSS feature whose value must be 1sg The interpretations
are similar to those in the previous examples so we will not give detailed descriptions
According to the morphological processor there are three parses which are due to the common
noun ek appendixsux and Ekim October Both root words are in the database but the
last two parses are eliminated in the third phase As a result there is only one parse as an
input to the last step There are two entries regarding the common noun ek which cause the
system to generate two feature structures for the single parse The processing takes about 40

Conclusions and Suggestions
In this thesis we present a lexicon for Turkish Our work includes determination of the lexical
specication to be encoded for all lexical types of Turkish encoding of this specication and
constructing a standalone system as an information repository for the NLP systems
The level of lexical specication for morphosyntactic and syntactic information is adequate but
as the semantic information is added in an ad hoc manner it may not satisfy all the requirements
of NLP systems on semantic information Including a knowledge-baseontology into the system
in which concepts are described through a semantic network would be useful This would
solve the problem related with the satisfying the semantic constraints in the subcategorization
information of lexical entries For example the constraint posing SEM  ANIMATE will not
be unied with SEM  HUMAN though this is semantically satisable
In order for our lexical database to be computationally useful more entries would be added
depending on the requirements of the NLP systems interfacing with our lexicon Currently
the database contains about 50 entries consisting of samples from closed and open-class words
having some special property We are planning to add more entries to cover all the closed-class
words and enrich the content for the open-class words of Turkish A graphical user interface
will be provided to help insertion deletetion and update operations to lexicon
