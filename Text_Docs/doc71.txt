Abstract
In Parikh and Wilczeks original works the laws of black hole thermo-
dynamics are not referred and it seems that there is no relation between
Hawking radiation via tunnelling and the laws of black hole thermody-
namics in their works However taking examples for the R-N black hole
and the Kerr black hole we nd that they are correlated and even con-
sistent if the tunnelling process is a reversible process
1 Introduction
In 2000 Parikh and Wilczek reconsidered Hawking radiation They argued
that the Hawking radiation is a tunnelling process and the barrier is created
just by the outgoing particle itself In this way They calculated the emission
rate from some static black holes and obtained the corrected spectrum1 2 3 4
Particularly their result is consistent with the underlying unitary theory and
support to the information conservation Following this method many other
static and stationary rotating black holes are also studied5 6 7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 and the results are the same as that in Parikh and Wilczeks
original works In this paper basing on those works and as a further study
we reinvestigate the Hawking radiation via tunnelling As we know the laws
of black hole thermodynamics are not referred neither in Parikh and Wilczeks
original works nor the extended works based on them And it seems that there is
no relation between Hawking radiation via tunnelling and the laws of black hole
thermodynamics Is it true that there is no relation between them15 In the
following discussion we rst take an example of the Reissner-Nordstrom black

hole we reinvestigate the Hawking radiation of charged particles via tunnelling
from it6 and rewrite the imaginary part of the action which is viewed from
the laws of black hole thermodynamics Then in the same way we reinvestigate
the Hawking radiation of particles with angular momentum via tunnelling from
the Kerr black hole7 Finally we give a brief conclusion and some discussion
about our result
2 Taking the R-N black hole for example
Recently Parikh and Wilczeks original works have been extended to the R-N
black hole As a typical static spherically symmetric solution of Einsteins eld
equation we rst take it for example According to Ref6 the imaginary part
of the action for the classically forbidden trajectory is
pr 
Z M Qq
Im S  ImZ rf
  ImZ rf
 Z M Qq
SBH 
2rp2M r  Q2
r2  2M r  Q2
2p2M r  Q2Q
r2  2M r  Q2
M pM 2  Q2Q
2 M   pM  2  Q  q22  M pM 2  Q22
M pM 2  Q22
pM 2  Q2
pM 2  Q2
where At  Q
potential and pAt is the corresponding canonical momentum conjugate
r is the rst component of the 4-Dimensional electromagnetic
Usually investigating 1 we can easily obtain that the result is consistent
with the underlying unitary theory so the information is conserved Our work
is also to reinvestigate 1 which we will discuss in the following
As we know for the R-N black hole when a charged massive particle tunnels
across the event horizon the mass and the charge of black hole will be changed
as a consequence According to the rst law of black hole thermodynamics the
dierential Bekenstein-Smarr equation of the R-N black hole is16
dA  V dQ J  0
Furthermore if the tunnelling process is considered as a reversible process ac-
cording to the second law of black hole thermodynamics 2 can be rewritten
dM  T dS  V dQ
Equally it can be rewritten as
The temperature and the potential are respectively6
pM 2  Q2
2M pM 2  Q22
M pM 2  Q2
Substituting 5 into 4 we can obtain
2M pM 2  Q22
pM 2  Q2
2M pM 2  Q2Q
pM 2  Q2
Thus using 6 we can rewrite 1 as
Im S  Z M Qq
dS  
SBH 
M pM 2  Q22
pM 2  Q2
M pM 2  Q2Q
pM 2  Q2
Which is also the same result as 1 The dierence is that the result in 7
implicates that Hawking radiation via tunnelling is correlated with the laws of
black hole thermodynamics
3 Taking the Kerr black hole for example
Having taking the R-N black hole for example instead we study another typical
solution a stationary axially symmetrical Kerr black hole And for the sake of
simplicity we only reinvestigate the case of a massless particle with angular mo-
mentum tunnelling across the event horizon According to Ref7 the imaginary
part of the action is

SBH 
As the same discussion in section 2 Our next task is to view and rewrite 8
from the laws of black hole thermodynamics For the Kerr black hole the rst
law of black hole thermodynamics is16
dA  dJ Q  0
And it will remain the same relationship if the tunnelling process is a re-
versible process we can obtain
The temperature the angle velocity and the angular momentum of Kerr
black hole are respectively7
M 2  a2
4M 2  MM 2  a2
  
  a2 
2M 2  MM 2  a2
 J  aM
Thus substituting 11 into 10 we get
4M 2  MM 2  a2
M 2  a2
M 2  a2
Comparing 12 with 8 it is easy to nd that we can also rewrite the imaginary
part of the action as follows
Im S  Z M 
2 Z M 
dS  
2M 2  MM 2  a2
4M 2  MM 2  a2
M 2  a2
M 2  a2
dM Z M 
M 2  a2
M 2  a2
SBH 
Which shows that the Hawking radiation via tunnelling is also relative with the
laws of black hole thermodynamics for the stationary axial symmetry case
4 Conclusion and Discussion
In section 2 and 3 we respectively take R-N black hole and Kerr black hole
for examples And we obtain the result that the Hawking radiations via tun-
nelling both in the static spherically symmetric case and the stationary axially
symmetric case are related to the laws of black hole thermodynamics In other
words Parikh and Wilczeks original works have already made the assumption
of the laws of black hole thermodynamics in detail the rst and the reversible
second law of black hole thermodynamics More general speaking Parikh and
Wilczeks original works are only suitable for the reversible process However in
fact because of the negative heat capacity an evaporating black hole is a highly
unstable system and there is no stable thermal equilibrium between black hole
and the outside Thus the tunnelling process is usually an irreversible process
in principle That is it is a little early for Parikh and Wilczek to say that the
tunnelling process is consistent with the underlying unitary theory
