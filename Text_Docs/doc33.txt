Abstract Low-mass cluster galaxies are the most common galaxy type in the
universe and are at a cornerstone of our understanding of galaxy formation cluster
luminosity functions dark matter and the formation of large scale structure I de-
scribe in this summary recent observational results concerning the properties and
likely origins of low-mass galaxies in clusters and the implications of these ndings
in broader galaxy formation issues
1 Low-Mass Cluster Galaxies
Although they are the faintest and lowest mass galaxies in the universe
low-mass cluster galaxies LMCGs especially dwarf ellipticals hold
clues for the ultimate understanding of galaxy formation dark matter
and structure formation The reason for this is quite simple low-mass
galaxies and particularly low-mass galaxies in clusters Conselice et al
2001 are the most common galaxies in the nearby universe Ferguson
 Binggeli 1994 Any ultimate galaxy evolutionformation scenario
must be able to predict and accurately describe the properties of these
objects In galaxy formation models such as hierarchical assembly eg
Cole et al 2000 massive dark halos form by the mergers of lower
mass ones early in the universe By understanding these LMCGs we
are potentially studying the very rst galaxies to form On the other
hand observations reveal that no low-mass galaxies formed all of their
stars early in the universe at z  7 with considerable evidence for star
formation occurring in the last few Gyrs eg Grebel 1997 Conselice
et al 2003
While low-mass galaxies are traditionally studied in low density
environments such as in the Local Group it is now clear that a large
population of these low-mass galaxies exist in clusters whose nature is
only recently becoming clear Conselice et al 2001 2003 A compar-
ison with the Local Group demonstrates that the ratio of low-mass to
large mass galaxies in clusters is roughly ve to ten times higher than
in low density environments This over density of LMCGs and the fact
that some Local Group dwarf spheroidals Klyena et al 2002 have
large dark matter halos hints that potentially a large amount of mass in
clusters is associated with low-mass galaxies New observational results

also suggest that early-type LMCGs are not a homogeneous population
but consist of at least two distinct types that are morphologically
similar but with dierent physical properties
2 New Observational Results
There are several observations listed below that suggest low-mass clus-
ter galaxies have unique dynamical kinematic and stellar population
properties that dier from properties of Local Group low-mass galaxies
see eg Conselice Gallagher  Wyse 2001 2002 2003 Rakos et al
2001 Pedraz et al 2002
1 Spatial Position While Local Group dwarf galaxies particularly
dwarf ellipticals are strongly clustered around the giant galaxies
in the Local Group van den Bergh 2000 the opposite is found
for low-mass galaxies in clusters where most are neither clustered
around nor distributed globally similar to the giant elliptical galax-
ies Conselice et al 2001

Low-Mass Cluster Galaxies
2 Radial Velocities The radial velocities of low-mass cluster galax-
ies including S0s spirals dwarf irregulars and dwarf ellipticals are
more widely distributed than the ellipticals see Figure 1a For
example Virgo cluster elliptical galaxies have a narrow Gaussian
velocity distribution with   462 km s1 concentrated at the
mean radial velocity of the cluster The other populations including
the over 100 classied dwarf ellipticals in Virgo with radial veloc-
ities have much broader and non-Gaussian velocity distributions
  700 km s1 all with velocity dispersion ratios with the
ellipticals consistent with their being accreted eg Conselice et
al 2001
3 Stellar Populations Faint LMCGs with MB  15 have a large
color scatter at a given magnitude eg Rakos et al 2001 Conselice
et al 2003 produced by galaxies that are both bluer and redder
than the extrapolated color-magnitude relationship as dened by
the giant elliptical galaxies Figure 1b This is found in several
nearby clusters including Fornax Coma and Perseus and can be
explained by the stellar populations in LMCGs having a mixture
of ages and metallicities eg Rakos et al 2001 Conselice et al
2003 Stromgren and broad-band photometry reveals that the red
LMCGs are metal enriched systems These red LMCGs steepen
the luminosity function LF of clusters and are responsible for
dierences in faint end LF slopes seen in clusters and in the eld
Conselice 2002
4 Internal Kinematics Some LMCGs show evidence for rotation
when observed out to at least one scale radii eg Pedraz et al
2002 Rotation is however not present in Local Group dEs such
as NGC 205 and NGC 185 eg van den Bergh 2000
3 LMCG Origins
Based on the observational results presented above it appears that some
LMCGs are fundamentally dierent than low-mass galaxies in groups
although bright LMCGs have similar photometric properties to Local
Group dEs eg Conselice et al 2003
Several possible physical mechanisms can potentially explain the
origin of LMCG populations In the simple collapse  feedback scenario
Dekel  Silk 1986 LMCGs are formed when gas collapses and forms
stars These stars produce winds that expels gas from these systems
halting any future star formation In this formation scenario LMCGs

formed before the cluster ellipticals or at least formed within groups
that later merged to form clusters Faint LMCGs however cannot all
be born in groups which later accreted into clusters along with the
massive galaxies due to the high LMCG to giant galaxy ratio found in
clusters Conselice et al 2001 2003 The above evidence suggests that
simple low-mass galaxy formation scenarios can be safely ruled out for
some LMCGs
One alternative idea is that present day LMCGs formed after the
cluster itself was in place by collapsing out of enriched intracluster
gas Another is that the intracluster medium ICM is able to retain
enriched gas that in the Dekel and Silk 1986 paradigm would be
ejected by feedback but remains due to the connement pressure of
the ICM Babul  Rees 1992 This scenario would explain the higher
metallicities of some of the fainter LMCGs
An alternative scenario is that LMCGs form in the cluster through
a tidal origin Two main possibilities for this are tidal dwarfs Duc 
Mirabel 1994 and as the remnants of stripped disks or dwarf irregulars
Conselice et al 2003 The velocity and spatial distributions of LMCGs
suggest that they must have been accreted into the cluster during the
last few Gyrs Conselice et al 2001 This combined with the high
metallicities of these LMCGs and the fact that their stellar popula-
tions are fundamentally dierent than eld dwarfs eg Conselice 2003
Figure 1b suggests that the cluster environment has morphologically
transformed accreted galaxies into LMCGs This is consistent with the
internal rotation found for some LMCGs Moore et al 1998 Ongoing
and future observations of the HI dynamical and dark properties of
LMCGs will soon allow for a more complete observational description
of these objects
