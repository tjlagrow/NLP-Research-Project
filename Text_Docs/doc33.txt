Abstract
We prove ergodicity of a point process earthquake model combining the
classical stress release model for primary shocks with the Hawkes model for
aftershocks

1 Introduction
The times of occurence of earthquakes in a given area of seismic activity form a
simple point process N on the real line where Na b is the number of shocks in
the time interval a b In the present model the dynamics governing the process
will be expressed by the stochastic intensity t In intuitive terms to be precised

is ergodic and the reader is refered to 9 for a proof and the relevant results con-
cerning a generalization of this particular model
Another model of interest in seismology is the Hawkes branching process where the
stochastic intensity is
t  t Z0t
ht  sNds
where h is a non-negative function called the fertility rate and  is a non-negative
integrable function Such point process appears in the specialized literature under
the name ETAS Epidemic Type After-Shock 12 and is used to model the after-
shocks see 7 p 203 It is well known that the corresponding process dies out
in nite time under the conditionR 
A model mixing stress release and Hawkes aftershocks is 13

where   0 The positive constant c is the rate at which the strain builds up If
there is a shock at time t then the strain is relieved by the quantity ZN t Each
shock primary or secondary at time t generates aftershocks according to a Poisson
process of intensity as  kets In this article we give necessary and sucient
conditions of ergodicity for this model We shall start with a precise mathematical
description of it
2 Description of the model
Let      0  be a non-decreasing function such that limx x  0
and limx x   We operate under either one of the following assumptions
a the function  may be strictly positive everywhere or b it is equal to zero
for all x below some level and otherwise strictly increasing
We are given
1 a Poisson eld  of intensity 1 in the positive quadrant and
2 an iid family of positive random variables Znn1 with a nite mean
and it is assumed that
3 the Poisson eld and the iid family are independent
The above Poisson eld and iid
family constitute the probabilistic basis of our
We consider a simple point process N with the following stochastic intensity
ets dNs
where Nt  N0 t and where X0 Y0 c k and  are as in the introduction
This means that the point process is constructed recursively as
N tXn1
t  X0  ct 
Nt Z0tZR
Zn  Y0et  kZ0t
Iz  tdz  dz
Dening
Ft  X0 Y0 Ns ZN s s  t
the process tt0 is then the Ft-stochastic intensity of N in the sense of 4 see
also 7 10
In the seismological interpretation
1t  X0  ct 
N tXn1
is the stochastic intensity of the primary shocks whereas
2t  Y0et  kZ0t
ets dNs
is the stochastic intensity of the aftershocks
The problem is to nd a necessary condition for the existence and uniqueness of the
corresponding stationary process and for any initial distribution of X0 and Y0 of
the convergence to that distribution and to prove formally that it is also sucient
under a further smoothnes condition on the distribution of Zi
3 On the ergodicity condition
The existence of ergodicity will be proven in the case
This section shows that this is indeed a natural intuitive condition and moreover
that it is necessary if we seek only those solutions for which the steady-state average
intensity   Et satises 0    
We therefore henceforth assume ergodicity From now on we use the notation
Xt  X0  ct 
N tXn1
Y t  Y0et  kZ0t
ets dNs
The process Xt Y t t  0 is a time-homogeneous Markov process with initial
value X0 Y0 and
t  Xt  Y t
Further ergodicity means in particular that there exists a stationary version of
the process Xt Y t For such a stationary version let 1  EXt and
2  EY t Then   1  2 so the niteness of  implies that of 1 and of 2
Observe that

The supercritical case Suppose in view of contradiction that k
  1 The last
equality then implies that    which we excluded or that   0 and then
1  EXt  0 Since Xt  0 this implies P Xt  0  1 that is
P Xt    1 Similarly P Y t  0  1
The critical case Suppose now again in view of contradiction that k

last displayed equality implies then that    excluded or 1  0 and therefore
P Xt  0  1 Then

We show that any point process N with this stochastic intensity and with nite
average intensity is necessarily null with intensity equal to 0 Suppose that   0
Clearly

and therefore since we assumed    we have that P NR  0  0 Now
NR  0  tNR  0  Nt   0 That is NR  0 is
expanded by the ergodic shift and therefore it has probability 0 or 1 By the
above this probability must be 1 We conclude that   0 a contradiction
Therefore in the critical case there is no solution except the trivial one no earth-
quakes
4 Explicit expressions for the average rates
In this section we exhibit an interesting feature of the model We assume here again
ergodicity and the condition 0     We continue to consider the model in the
stationary regime Writing
Xt  X0  tc 
N tXn1
Zn
 X0  tc  EZ1  t
where limt t  0 as Let   c  EZ1 Let  be the as nite random
time such that t   implies t  1
Suppose that c  EZ1  0 We have
2
EXt  EXt1t   EX0  t
1t 
But X0  t 1
2 1t    as t   and therefore
1  EXt  
implying that    which is excluded
Suppose that cEZ1  0 We show that this is imposible Here limt Xt 
0 by a similar argument We prove that limt EXt  0 1  0 and therefore
  0 which is impossible
For the proof that limt EXt  0 we can make use of the following lemma
in fact taking care of both situations when c  EZ1 6 0
Lemma 1 If the stationary stochastic process Ztt0 is such that it tends almost
surely to a deterministic constant c as t   then it is almost surely equal to this
constant
Proof Fix   0 and consider the set
C   Zt   c   c   for all t  0
Then for all a  0
aC   Zt   c   c   for all t  a
But aC   and therefore P C  P aC  1 So that P C  1 Since this is
true for all   0
P Zt  c  1
for all
t  0
Therefore necessarily
Therefore in this model the rate of occurences of earthquakes is given by the physics
of stress build up the constant c and stress release EZ1 whereas the global rate
is shared among primary and secondary earthquakes according to the physics of the
aftershocks  and k
5 Two embeddings
We now turn to the technical core of the paper namely the proof of existence of
a unique ergodic solution of the model under the condition k
  1 and a further
condition on the distribution of Zi see Condition CZ in Section 7 The technique
used is that of Harris chains and we start as usual by studying a natural embedded
process More precisely let tnn0 with t0  0 be the sequence of time events
of N and let for each n  0 Tn1  tn1  tn Xn  Xtn Yn  Y tn We
then have the recurrence equations that exactly reect the dynamics described in
the previous section
Xn1  Xn  cTn1  Zn1
Yn1  YneTn1  k
where Sn1 is a positive random variable whose hazard rate is conditionally to
X0     Xn Y0     Yn T1     Tn and Z1     Zn
Xn  cs  Ynes
It is clear that Xn Ynn0 is a homogeneous Markov chain Its transition mecha-
nism is fully described by the rst transition which can be implemented as follows
Let X0  x and Y0  y  0 On the positive half-plane with the time t running on
the horizontal coordinate axis draw two curves
a a curve with graph t x  ct that starts from 0 x
b a curve with graph t yet that starts from 0 y
Consider the projection on the time axis of the Poisson eld between the above two
curves and let T1 be the point of this projection with the smallest t-coordinate It
has as the notation anticipated the required hazard rate x  cs  yes

Two lemmas concerning this particular realization of the transition kernel will be
useful
Let Txy be a generic random variable with distribution

Proof Inequality 6 is straightforward Inequality 7 follows from the mono-
tonicity of  while inequality 8 follows from the following coupling construction
Let t0  0 be such that x1  ct0  x2 If there is a point of the Poisson eld in
t u  0  t  t0 0  u  x1  ct then T 1x1  t0 and x1  cT 1x1  x2 If
however there is no such a point then
x1  cT 1x1  x2  cT 1x2  t1
where tt0 is a family of measure-preserving shift transformations So with
probability 1
x1  cT 1x1  x2  cT 1x2  t st x2  cT 1x2
The remaining results follow from inequality 8 and from the fact that x  
as x  
Corollary 1 For any x0
ETxy  0 as
y  
ETxy  0 as x  
Proof By Lemma 2 0  Txy st Tx0y for any x  x0 Clearly T 2y  0
in probability as y   Since ET 1x0 is nite the family of random variables
Tx0yy0 is uniformly integrable and therefore
ETxy  ETx0y  0
y  
Further from inequality 5 Txy st T 1x where T 1x  0 in probability By
7 and since ET 10 is nite the family T 1xx0 is uniformly integrable and
therefore ET 1x  0 as x   and then 10 follows

Remark As follows from 5 and Lemma 2 if x  0 then
Txy st T 10
and therefore

ETxy  ET 10  
One may also deduce from Lemma 2 that if x  0 then
cTxy st x  cT 10  Z
where the random variables in the right-hand side are integrable So one can nd a
universal constant C  0 such that
ETxy  Cx  1
for all x  0 and y  0
Then it follows from 11 and 12 that for any negative x1
xx1y0
ETxy  
However the supremum in 13 becomes innite if one replaces x1 by 
To keep the supremum nite we consider a slightly dierent embedding Again
we describe the rst transition only We x a suciently large positive v0 and a
suciently large negative x1 to be chosen in the next section and dene the new
embedding eTxy as follows
a if x  x1 then eTxy  minTxy v0 while
b if x  x1 then eTxy  Txy
Then clearly

Denote by eXneYn a new time-homogeneous Markov chain obtained by the new
embedding It satises the relations given eX0  xeY0  y if x  x1 then
and if x  x1 then

6 Positive recurrence of the embedded process
In this section we show positive recurrence of the Markov chain obtained by the
second embedding eXneYn  see the end of the previous section We recall some
known facts
Denition Consider a discrete-time and time-homogeneous Markov chain Wn n 
0 on a measurable state space W BW  A measurable set V  Z is positive recurrent
if the following two conditions hold
a A random variable
wV   minn  1  Wn  V  W0  w
is as nite for all w  W
b Moreover
EwV   
For a Markov chain Wn the following result is known as Fosters criterion
Proposition 1 Let L  W  0  be a measurable function and let bL be a
non-negative number The set V  w  W  Lw bL is positive recurrent if
i supwV ELW1 W0  w is nite
ii there exists   0 such that
ELW1 W0  w  Lw  
for any w  W  V 
Theorem 1 Let k   For suitably chosen v0 and x1 there exists a compact set
V in    0  which is positive recurrent for the Markov chain eXneYn
Remark A sequence Xn Yn is a subsequence of eXneYn With arguments similar
to those of Theorem 1 one can also prove that the same set V is positive recurrent
for the Markov chain Xn Yn
Proof of Theorem 1 We use Fosters criterion with the following choice of the
test function
Lx y  L1x  L2y r1x  r2y
r3x  r2y
if x  0
if x  0
where r1 r2 r3 are strictly positive to be chosen later
First of all for any C1 C2  0
Indeed let r  maxr1 r2 r3 Then for any x y from the set above
xC1
ELeX1eY1  eX0  xeY0  y  
eTxy st T 1C1  bT 
and bT has a nite mean Therefore for all x y from this set
ELeX1eY1  eX0  xeY0  y  rC1  C2  EbT  EZ  k  
and 15 follows
Now we impose several constraints on the coecients r1 r2 r3 First we assume
r3  r1
r1EZ  r2k
Let   k  2  0 We also assume that
r2  r3EZ
In the proof we use only conditions 16 - 18 which are in particular satised if
r1  r2  r3  0
Now we proceed to show that all the dierences
ELeX1eY1  eX0eY0  x y  Lx y
are bounded above by some negative constant if x y is outside the set x1 x0 
0 y0 where x1 x0 and y0 will be chosen in the proof For this consider separately
two cases a x  0 and b x  0
Case x  0
In this case the one-step embedding is the natural one so we may write X1 Y1
instead of eX1eY1
3  minr2  r3EZ r1EZ  r2k  0
Choose x0  0 so big that
r1cET 1x0  
r1  r3EZ  x0  
By Lemma 3 we may choose y0  0 so large that
and that
yEcid161  eT 2ycid17  k 
for all
y  y0
r1cET0y0  
Then choose v0  0 so large that
yEcid161  e minv0T 2ycid17  k 
and that the following inequality holds
for all
y  y0
ey0    r3EZ  r2k
Write for short
ExyLX1 Y1  ELX1 Y1  X0  x Y0  y  ExyL1X1  ExyL2Y1
If x  0 then
ExyL1X1  L1x  r1E x  cTxy  ZIx  cTxy  Z  0
 r3E x  cTxy  ZIx  cTxy  Z  0  r1x
 cE Txy r1Ix  cTxy  Z  0  r3Ix  cTxy  Z  0

 r1cETxy  r1EZ  r1  r3EZ  x
EL2Y1  L2y  r2yEeTxy  k  r2y
In particular if x  x0
ExyL1X1  L1x  r1cET 1x0  r1EZ  r1  r3EZ  x0
where we used representation 5 and Lemma 2 and
EL2Y1  L2y  r2k
so in view of 19 20 and 21
ExyLX1 Y1  Lx y      3  
Furthermore if y  y0 and 0  x  x0 then by Lemma 2
ExyL1X1  L1x  r1cET0y0  r3EZ
and by inequality 22
EL2Y1  L2y  r2
ExyLX1 X2  Lx y  r1cET0y0  r3EZ  r2    3  
by 19 and 23 So if x  0 and if either x  x0 or y  y0 then
ExyLX1 Y1  Lx y  
Case x  0
For the time being x any value of x1  0 First we observe that if y  y0 where y0
satises inequalities 22 and 23 then again the increments ExyLX1 Y1Lx y
have a uniformly negative drift in all x1  x  0 Indeed if eX0  x  x1 0
then for any y  0 eX1  x  Txy  Z1 admits the following bounds
eX1IeX1  0 as x  Z1IeX1  0
eX1IeX1  0  max0 eX1  max0 minx  cT 1x x  T 2y
From Lemma 2 and from independence of T 1x and T 2y we obtain
eX1IeX1  0 st mincT 10 cT 2y  cT0y
Therefore for any x1  x  0
ExyL1eX1  r1ExyeX1IeX1  0  r3ExyeX1IeX1  0
 r1ExyeX1  IeX1  0  r3Exyx  EZ1IeX1  0
 r1cET0y  r3x  r3EZ
Since y0 satises unequalities 22 and 23 we have for all x1  x  0 and y  y0
ExyLeX1eY1  Lx y  r1cET0y0  r3EZ  r2  
We now choose x1  1 so large that the increment of LeXeY  has a uniformly
negative drift for all x  x1 We start with the assumption that
x1  cv0
Therefore if eX0  x  x1 and eY0  y then

L2eY1  r2cid16yeeTxy  kITxy  v0cid17  r2cid16yeeTxy  kcid17 
We impose two additional constraints on x1 making it even more negatively large
Since x  0 as x   one can choose x1  cv0 x1  1 such that
eR v0
0 x1cvdv  12
Secondly it follows that T 1x   in probability as x   and therefore from
24 one can choose x1  cv0 such that
yEcid161  eeTxycid17  k  
for all
y  y0
and x  x1
Assume that x1 satises all of the three conditions 2931 If y  y0 then for
any x  x1
ExyLeX1eY1  Lx y  r3cEeTxy  EZ  r2cid16yEeeTxy  kcid17  r2y

by 31
If instead y  y0 and x  x1 then
PTxy  v0  PTxy0  v0

since the random variables Txy are stochastically decreasing in y again by Lemma
2 Therefore for eTxy  minv0 Txy

due to 25
As an outcome we have that if y0 satises conditions 2223 if v0 satises 24
25 and if x1 satises 2931 then the increments of ELeX1eY1 have a drift
bounded above by  for all initial values such that either x  x1 or x  0 and
y  y0
The set
V  x1 x0  0 y0
Also as follows from the classical proof of Fosters criterion for any initial value

eX0eY0  x y a random variable
xyV   minn  1  eXneYn  V  X0 Y0  x y
is almost-surely nite and moreover there exists an absolute constant C  0 such
for all x y see eg 11 or 8 The proof of Theorem 1 is complete

7 Harris ergodicity
We recall the following classical result see for instance 11
Proposition 2 Assume that a Markov chain Wn n  0 taking valued in a measur-
able space W BW  is aperiodic and that there exists a positive recurrent set V that
admits a minorant measure ie there exist a positive integer m a positive p  1
and a probability measure  such that
PWm   W0  w  V   p
Then the Markov chain is Harris ergodic which means that there exists a unique
stationary distribution say  and that for any initial value W0  w there is a
convergence of the distributions of Wn to the stationary one in the total variation
P Wn  B  B  0 n  
In practice the most technical part in applying this criterion is to verify the aperi-
odicity There are a number of sucient conditions available for the Markov chain
to be aperiodic and Harris ergodic
We mention two of them The most common is the following condition
Sucient condition 1 SC1 A Markov chain Wn is Harris ergodic if there exists
a positive recurrent set V such that condition 33 holds with m  1 and with 
such that V   0
However in our proof it seems to be easier to verify another  slightly more general
 sucient condition
Sucient condition 2 SC2 A Markov chain Wn is Harris ergodic if there exists
a positive recurrent set V such that condition 33 holds with a nite number of
dierent values of m say mi i  1 2     k which are such that
gcdmi 1  i  k  1
We will apply condition SC2 with k  2 and with m1  2 and m2  3 For that
we introduce a condition on the distribution of Z which leads to SC2
Condition CZ There exist 0  z1  z2   such that for some h  0 and for
any u1 u2  z1 z2
PZ  u1 u2  hu2  u1
In other words the distribution of Z has an absolutely continuous wr to Lebesgue
measure component whose density function is above level h everywhere in the
interval z1 z2
Theorem 2 Assume condition CZ to hold Then the Markov chain Xn Yn is
Harris ergodic
Proof We may assume without loss of generality that z2  z1  x0  x1
Letey1  y1  k and
and let
ex0  infx  x0  x  0  z2  2
V1  x1ex0  0ey0
PxyX1 Y1  V1  PxyX1  x1ex0
so V  V1 Then for any x y  V  PxyY1 ey0  1 so by Lemmas 23

 Px1  cT 1x1  ex0  z1  1ex0  z1
 PcT 2ey0 ex0  z1  x1PZ1  z1z2
Denote by R0 the value of the rightmost side of the above inequality note that it
is positive Then for any x y  V1
PxyX1 Y1  V1  R0  0
Take some small positive   z2  z14 to be specied later Choose t2  0 so
large that x2  x1  ct2  ex0  z2 and y0ex2ex0   Let b  x2  z2 and
note that b  0 Then for any x y  V1
PxcTxy  x2 x2 yeTxy    bPT 1x1  x2x1cPT 2y0  x2x1c
Denote by R1 the right-hand side of the inequality above which is a positive num-
ber Then for any x y  V1 and for X1 Y1  x  Txy  Z1 yeTxy  k
PxyX1 Y1  x2  z1   x2  z1  k k    R1
z2  z1
 R2  0
From the construction above one may conclude that for any x y  V 
bV  x2  z1   x2  z1  k k  
PxyX1 Y1  bV   R2  0
xyV
since V  V1 and then that by the Markov property
PxyX2 Y2  bV   R0 
xyV1
PxyX1 Y1bV   R0R2  0
Now take   0 so small that one can choose positive numbers t3 and t4 such that

and that

Then for any y  k k   we have the inclusion k1 k2  yet4 yet3
For any x y  bV denote by gxyu a density function of random variable yealphaTxy
which clearly has an absolutely continuous distribution

so 36 holds with c0  c1c2
Furthermore let x3  x2  z1    t3 Note that if x y  bV and Txy  t3 t4 then
x  cTxy  x3 x3   Then by condition CZ given x  cTxy  v  x3 x3  
the random variable v  Z1 has an absolutely continuous component with a uniform
distribution on the interval x3  z1  z22 x3  z1
We may therefore conclude that for any x y  bV

It follows from inequalities 34 35 and 37 that condition SC2 is satised
with k  2 and with m1  2 and m2  3 and this completes the proof
Corollary 2 Assume again that k   and that condition SZ holds Consider
the Markov chain eXneYn and let 0  S1  S2     Sk     be consequtive times
of the ends of discrete-time cycles where random vectors eXSkeYk have uniform
distribution in the rectangle V2 Then random variables lk  Sk  Sk1 k  2 are
iid with a nite mean
A proof of this result can be found for instance in 1
8 Stability in continuous time
Theorem 3 Under condition CZ
1 there exists a unique stationary version of the continuous-time Markov process
Xt Y t which is also ergodic
2 for any initial value X0  X0  x Y 0  Y0  y the process Xt Y t
converges to the stationary one in the total variation norm
Proof Consider again the embedded Markov chain eXneYn and its cycles of
length lk Then the corresponding cycles in continuous time are dened as
k  1 2   
SkXiSk11bT bXibYi
which are again iid for k  2
Then a proof of the theorem follows from the two results below Statement 1 and
Statement 2 see for instance 1 Proposition 38 p203 or 2 Section 7 or 3
Chapter 3
Statement 1 The distribution of random variables Lk k  2 has an absolutely
continuous component with a density function which is separated from 0 on a nite
time interval of positive length
Statement 2 EL2 is nite
Statement 1 may be veried directly using arguments similar to those in the previous
section Furthermore since C  supxy EeTxy

and the result follows
