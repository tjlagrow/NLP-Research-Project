Cell membranes interact via anchored receptor and ligand molecules Central questions on cell adhesion
concern the binding afnity of these membrane-anchored molecules the mechanisms leading to the receptor-
ligand domains observed during adhesion and the role of cytoskeletal and other active processes In this review
these questions are addressed from a theoretical perspective We focus on models in which the membranes are
described as elastic sheets and the receptors and ligands as anchored molecules In these models the thermal
membrane roughness on the nanometer scale leads to a cooperative binding of anchored receptor and ligand
molecules since the receptor-ligand binding smoothens out the membranes and facilitates the formation of
additional bonds Patterns of receptor domains observed in Monte Carlo simulations point towards a joint role
of spontaneous and active processes in cell adhesion The interactions mediated by the receptors and ligand
molecules can be characterized by effective membrane adhesion potentials that depend on the concentrations
and binding energies of the molecules
INTRODUCTION
The adhesion of cells is mediated by the specic binding
of receptor and ligand molecules anchored in the cell mem-
branes Cell adhesion processes are essential for the distinc-
tion of self and foreign in immune responses the formation of
tissues or the signal transduction across the synaptic cleft of
neurons 1 These processes have therefore been studied in-
tensively with a variety of experimental methods 2 3 4 5 6
In addition experiments on lipid vesicles with membrane-
anchored receptor and ligand molecules aim to mimic the
specic membrane binding processes leading to cell adhesion
7 8 9
In many adhesion processes the anchored receptor and lig-
and molecules can still diffuse at least to some extent within
the contact area of the adhering membranes 3 4 6 As a
consequence the receptor-ligand complexes may form differ-
ent spatial patterns such as clusters or extended domains in the
contact area 3 6 10 11 These pattern formation processes
can be understood in the framework of discrete models in
which the membranes are divided into small patches and the
receptors and ligands are described as single molecules that
are either present or absent in the patches 12 13 14 15 16
These discrete models are lattice models on elastic surfaces
and have two advantages i They automatically incorporate
the mutual exclusion of receptor or ligand molecules anchored
within the same membrane and ii they lead to effective
membrane adhesion potentials that provide an intuitive under-
standing of the observed behavior in terms of nucleation and
growth processes
Cell adhesion involves many different length scales from
nanometers to tens of micrometers The largest length scales
of micrometers correspond to the diameter of the cell and

the diameter of the contact zone in which the cell is bound
to another cell or to a supported membrane The separation
of the two membranes in the cell contact zone is orders of
magnitude smaller The membrane separation is comparable
to the length of the receptor-ligand complexes which have
a typical extension between 15 and 40 nanometers 17 Fi-
nally the smallest relevant length scale is the binding range
of a receptor and a ligand molecule ie the difference be-
tween the smallest and the largest local membrane separation
at which the molecules can bind The binding range reects
i the range of the lock-and-key interaction ii the exibil-
ity of the two binding partners and iii the exibility of the
membrane anchoring For the rather rigid protein receptors
and ligands that typically mediate cell adhesion the interac-
tion range is around 1 nanometer In contrast the interaction
range of surface-anchored exible tether molecules with spe-
cic binding sites is signicantly larger 18 19 20 21
The wide range of length scales has important conse-
quences for modeling cell adhesion In general the elastic-
ity of the cell membrane is affected by the bending rigidity 
of the membrane 22 the membrane tension  and the cy-
toskeleton that is coupled to the membrane 23 24 25 26
The tension dominates over the bending elasticity on length
scales larger than the crossover lengthcid112 27 which is of
the order of several hundred nanometers for cell membranes
28 while the bending elasticity dominates on length scales
smaller than the crossover length The elastic contribution of
the cytoskeleton is relevant on length scales larger than the av-
erage distance of the cytoskeletal membrane anchors which
is around 100 nanometers 1 The overall shape of the cell
membrane on micrometer scales therefore is governed by the
cytoskeletal elasticity and membrane tension In the cell ad-
hesion zone however the relevant shape deformations and
uctuations of the membranes occur on length scales up to
the average distance of the receptor-ligand bonds since the
bonds locally constrain the membrane separation The aver-
age distance of the bonds roughly varies between 50 and 100
nanometers for typical bond concentrations in cell adhesion
zones 3 The relevant membrane shape deformations and
uctuations in the cell contact zone are therefore dominated
by the bending rigidity of the membranes
The adhesion of cells is mediated by a multitude of differ-
ent receptor and ligand molecules Some of these molecules
can be strongly coupled to the cytoskeleton In focal adhe-
sions of cells for example clusters of integrin molecules are
tightly coupled to the cytoskeleton via supramolecular assem-
blies that impose constraints on the lateral separation of the
integrins 5 29 Through focal adhesions cells exert and
sense forces 30 31 32 33 34 35 Other receptor and lig-
and molecules are not 4 or only weakly 36 coupled to the
cytoskeleton These molecules are mobile and diffuse within
the membranes The diffusion process can be observed with
single-molecule experiments 37 38
The adhesion of membranes via mobile receptor and lig-
and molecules has been studied theoretically with a variety
of models These models can be grouped into two classes
In both classes the membranes are described as thin elas-
tic sheets
In the rst class of models the description is
continuous in space and the distribution of the membrane-
anchored receptor and ligand molecules on the membranes
are given by continuous concentration proles 39 40 41 42
43 44 45 46 Dynamic time-dependent properties of such
models have been studied by numerical solution of reaction-
diffusion equations 45 47 48 49
In the second more
recent class of models the membranes are discretized and
the receptors and ligands are described as single molecules
12 13 15 16 28 50 51 52 53 54 55 The dynamic
properties can be numerically studied with Monte Carlo sim-
ulations 14 28 53 54 56 and central aspects of the equi-
librium behavior can be directly inferred from the partition
function 13 15 16 50
II EFFECTIVE ADHESION POTENTIAL
In discrete models the two apposing membranes in the con-
tact zone of cells or vesicles are divided into small patches
12 13 15 16 28 50 51 52 53 54 55 These patches can
contain a single receptor or ligand molecule Mobile recep-
tor and ligand molecules diffuse by hopping from patch to
patch and the thermal uctuations of the membranes are re-
ected in variations of the local separation of apposing mem-
brane patches A receptor can bind to a ligand molecule if the
ligand is located in the membrane patch apposing the recep-
tor and if the local separation of the membranes is close to
the length of the receptor-ligand complex In these models
the linear size a of the membrane patches is typically chosen
around 5 nm to capture the whole spectrum of bending defor-
mations of the lipid membranes 57
Cells can interact via a multitude of different receptors and
ligands However it is instructive to start with the relatively
simple situation in which the adhesion is mediated by a single
type of receptor-ligand bonds as in g 1a Such a situation
occurs if a cell adheres to a supported membane with a single
type of ligands or if a vesicle with membrane-anchored re-
ceptors adheres to a membrane with complementary ligands
The effective membrane adhesion potential mediated by the
receptor and ligands can be calculated by integrating over all

and molecules lead to an effective single-well adhesion potential Vef

the concentrations and binding afnity of receptors and ligands see

of receptors and ligands the effective adhesion potential of
the membranes is a single-well potential with the same range
lwe as the receptor-ligand interaction but an effective binding
energy Uef that depends on the concentrations and binding en-
ergy U of receptors and ligands see g 1b For typical con-
centrations of receptors and ligands in cell membranes which
are more than two orders of magnitude smaller than the max-
imum concentration 1a2 cid39 4  104m2 in our discretized

parallel membranes with a separation equal to the length of the
receptor-ligand bonds The equilibrium constant characterizes

librium properties of the membranes and lead to an intuitive
understanding of these properties see next sections
III BINDING COOPERATIVITY
A receptor molecule can only bind an apposing ligand if
the local membrane separation is comparable to the length of
the receptor-ligand complex A central quantity therefore is
the fraction Pb of the apposing membranes with a separation
within the binding range of the receptor-ligand interaction
The concentration of bound receptor-ligand complexes
RL  Pb Kpl RL
is proportional to Pb as well as to the concentrations R and
L of unbound receptors and ligands 58
Thermal shape uctuations of the membranes on nanome-
ter scales in general lead to values of Pb smaller than 1 For
cell membranes these nanometer scale uctuations are not
or only weakly suppressed by the cell cytoskeleton in con-
trast to large-scale shape uctuations For simplicity we as-
sume now that the adhesion of the membranes is mediated by
a single type of receptor and ligand molecules as in g 1a
The precise value of Pb then depends on the well depth Uef
of the effective adhesion potential shown in g 1b and on
the bending rigidities of the membranes For typical lengths
and concentrations of receptors and ligands in cell adhesion
zones the fraction Pb of the membranes within binding range
of the receptors and ligands turns out to be much smaller than
1 and scaling analysis and Monte Carlo simulations lead to
the relation 58

weKpl RL
which shows that the membrane fraction Pb within the binding
range of the receptors and ligands is proportional to R and
L Inserting eq 7 into eq 5 leads to
RL  ckBT l2
plR2L2
The concentration RL of receptor-ligand complexes in the
adhesion zone thus depends quadratically on the concentra-
tions R and L of unbound receptors and ligands which
indicates cooperative binding The binding cooperativity re-
sults from a smoothening of the thermally rough membranes
and thus an increase of Pb with increasing concentrations R
and L of receptors and ligands which facilitates the forma-
tion of additional receptor-ligand complexes The relations
7 and 8 are good approximations up to Pb cid46 02 and can
be extended to larger values of Pb 58

the binding afnity of the molecules and can in principle be
measured with the surface force apparatus in which the ap-
posing membranes are supported on rigid substrates 59 60
In the case of exible membranes the binding afnity of the
receptors and ligands is more difcult to capture see next sec-
The interaction of cells is often mediated by several types
of receptor-ligand complexes that differ in their length For
two types of receptors and ligands as in g 2 the effective
adhesion potential of the membranes is a double-well poten-
tial 15 The depths of the two wells
1  kBT R1L1 a2eU1kB T
2  kBT R2L2 a2eU2kB T
depend on the concentrations and binding energies U1 and
U2 of the different types of receptors and ligands 58
analogy to eq 2 the quantities Kpl1  a2eU1kB T and
Kpl2  a2eU2kB T can be interpreted as binding equilibrium
constants in the case of planar membranes with a separation
equal to the lengths l1 or l2 of the receptor-ligand complexes
Repulsive membrane-anchored molecules such as anchored
polymers or glycoproteins can lead to additional barriers in
the effective adhesion potential 16 50 51 The effective
adhesion potentials simplify the characterization of the equi-
 lUef2Uef1Vefablbalwelweis proportional to the volume concentrations R3D and L3D
of unbound receptors and unbound ligands in the solution
The binding afnity of the molecules then can be character-
ized by the equilibrium constant K3D which depends on the
binding free energy of the complex 61 62 63 In analogy to
eq 9 the binding afnity of membrane-anchored receptors
and ligands is often quantied by
K2D  RL
where RL R and L are the area concentrations of bound
receptor-ligand complexes unbound receptors and unbound
ligands 64 65 66
However it follows from our relation 8 that K2D is not
constant but depends on the concentrations of the receptors
and ligands From the eqs 2 and 5 we obtain the general
relation
K2D  PbKpl
As mentioned in the previous section Kpl is the well-dened
two-dimensional equilibrium constant of the receptors and lig-
ands in the case of planar membranes with Pb  1 eg two
supported membranes in the surface force apparatus with a
separation equal to the length of the receptor-ligand complex
59 60
The relation 11 also helps to understand why different ex-
perimental methods for measuring K2D have led to values that
differ by several orders of magnitude 65 In uorescence re-
covery experiments K2D is measured in the equilibrated con-
tact zone of a cell adhering to a supported membrane with
uorescently labeled ligands 67 68 69 70 In micropipette
experiments in contrast K2D is measured for initial contacts
between two cells 66 71 72 for which Pb can be several
orders of magnitude smaller than in equilibrium 58
IV ADHESION OF VESICLES
Important aspects of cell adhesion can be mimicked by lipid
vesicles with anchored receptor molecules 7 8 9 73 74
75 76 We focus here on a vesicle adhering to a supported
membrane with complementary ligands In the strong adhe-
sion limit the shape of the vesicle can be approximated by
a spherical cap 77 78 The volume of the cap depends on
the osmotic pressure balance between the outside and the in-
terior of the vesicle If this volume is nearly constant the con-
tact area Ac is nearly independent of the adhesion free energy
52 78 79 80
Since the total number NR of receptors in the vesicle mem-
brane is xed we have
FIG 3 Concentrations RL and R of bound and unbound recep-
tors as a function of the receptor number NR of a vesicle adhering
to a supported membrane see eqs 13 and 14 In this numerical
example we have chosen the bending rigidity   25kBT  the bind-
ing range lwe  1 nm the binding equilibrium constant Kpl  1 m2
for planar membranes and a ligand concentration L  20m2 for
the supported membrane which results in the value 014m2 for
the parameter b in eqs 13 and 14 The total area of the vesicle is
100 m2 and the area of the contact zone is 30 m2 The fraction Pb
of the vesicle membrane in the contact zone with a separation within
binding range of the receptors and ligands varies with R see eq 7
and attains the maximum value Pb  017 for NR  5000 in this
example
and within the non-adhering membrane section of the vesi-
cle are approximately equal in equilibrium since the excluded
volume of the receptor-ligand complexes in the contact area is
negligible With eq 8 we then obtain

not linear in NR see g 3 for a numerical example

Cells often interact via receptor-ligand complexes that dif-
fer signicantly in size For example two important com-
plexes in T-cell adhesion are the complexes of the T-cell re-
ceptor TCR with a length of 15 nm and integrin complexes

depths U ef

2  the membranes are either bound in well 1 or well 2 ie they are either bound by
the short or by the long receptorligand complexes At intermediate well depths U ef

The critical point for the lateral phase separation star follows from eq 15 For typical dimensions of cell receptors and ligands the critical
well depth U ef
c for lateral phase separation is signicantly larger than the critical depths of unbinding 15 In the absence of other repulsive
interactions as assumed here the membranes unbind due to steric repulsion

with a length of 40 nm 17 The length mismatch induces
a membrane-mediated repulsion between the different com-
plexes because the membranes have to be curved to compen-
sate the mismatch which costs bending energy
The equilibrium behavior of two membranes adhering via
long and short receptor-ligand complexes is determined by the
effective double-well adhesion potential shown in g 2b
and by the bending rigidities of the membranes The depths
of the two wells reect the concentrations and binding afn-
ity of the two different types of receptors and ligands see
eqs 3 and 4 in section II If the two wells are relatively
shallow membrane segments can easily cross the barrier be-
tween the wells driven by thermal uctuations
If the two
wells are deep the crossing from one well to the other well
is suppressed by the potential barrier of width lba between the
wells The potential barrier induces a line tension between a
membrane segment that is bound in one of the wells and an
adjacent membrane segment bound in the other well Beyond
a critical depth of the potential wells the line tension leads
to the formation of large membrane domains that are bound
in well one or well two see g 4 Within each domain the
adhesion of the membranes is predominantly mediated by one
of the two types of receptor-ligand complexes
Scaling arguments indicate that domains bound in either

well 1 or well 2 are formed if the depths U ef
two potential wells exceed the critical potential depth 15

Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations conrm

depends on the effective rigidity   121  2 of
two membranes with bending rigidities 1 and 2 and the
width lwe and separation lba of the two potential wells see
g 2b The separation lba of the wells is close to the length
mismatch of the different types of receptor-ligand complexes
which is 25 nm for T cells A reasonable estimate for the in-
teraction range lwe of the protein receptors and ligands that
mediate cell adhesion is 1 nm see section I With an effec-
tive bending rigidity   121  2 of eg 25 kBT

we obtain the estimate U ef
cal potential depth of domain formation during T-cell adhe-
sion For planar-membrane equilibrium constants Kpl1 and
Kpl2 around 1 m2 for example the effective potential depths
3 and 4 exceed this critical potential depth if the con-
centrations of unbound receptors and ligands are larger than
20m2
B Domain patterns during immune cell adhesion
The domains of long and short receptor-ligand complexes
formed during the adhesion of T cells and other immune cells
such as natural killer cells evolve in characteristic patterns
For T cells the domains either contain complexes of TCR and
its ligand MHC-peptide or integrin complexes The nal do-
main pattern in the T-cell contact zone is formed within 15 to
30 minutes and consists of a central TCR domain surrounded
by a ring-shaped integrin domain 3 10 see g 5a Inter-
estingly the intermediate patterns formed within the rst min-
utes of T-cell adhesion are quite different 3 11 They are
either inverse to the nal pattern with a central integrin do-
main surrounded by a ring-shaped TCR domain see g 5c
or exhibit several nearly circular TCR domains in the contact
bound in   well 1 bound in   well 2 unbound  bound in both wells U1efU2ef6
hesion the Monte Carlo patterns exhibit small TCR clusters
14 In the following seconds the diffusion of free TCR and
MHC-peptide molecules into the contact zone lead to faster
growth of TCR clusters close to the periphery of the contact
zone 84 For sufciently large TCR-MHC-peptide concen-
trations the peripheral TCR clusters grow into the ring-shaped
domain of g 5c At smaller TCR-MHC-peptide concen-
tration the initial clusters evolve into the pattern of g 5d
In agreement with experimental observations 11 only these
two types of intermediate patterns are formed in the simula-
tions The simulated patterns emerge spontaneously from the
nucleation of TCR clusters and the diffusion of unbound TCR
and MHC-peptide into the contact zone
Implications for T-cell activation
T cells mediate immune responses by adhering to cells that
display foreign peptides on their surfaces 1 85 The pep-
tides are presented by MHC proteins on the cell surfaces and
are recognized by the T-cell receptors TCR T-cell activa-
tion requires the binding of TCRs to the MHC-peptide com-
plexes But how precisely these binding events trigger T-cell
activation still is a current focus of immunology for reviews
see refs 86 87 88 Recent experiments indicate that the
rst T-cell activation signals coincide with the formation of
TCR microclusters within the rst seconds of T-cell adhesion
89 90 91 92 93 94
In the discrete model introduced in section II and g 2
TCR clusters in the T-cell contact zone can only form if two
conditions are met First the effective potential depth U ef
the short TCR-MHC-peptide complexes and the depth U ef
the long integrin complexes have to exceed the critical depth
FIG 6 Schematic diagram for the joint role of foreign and self
MHC-peptides in TCR cluster formation and T-cell activation Here
Mf  is the concentration of foreign MHC-peptides and Ms is the
concentration of self MHC-peptides The solid line represents the
threshold for TCR cluster formation given by eq 17 The slope
of this line is the negative ratio KTMsKTMf of the binding equilib-
rium constants for the interaction of TCR with self MHC-peptide and
with foreign MHC-peptide For simplicity we have assumed here a
single dominant type of self MHC-peptides
FIG 5 Domain patterns in the T-cell contact zone a Final pattern
of helper T cells with a central TCR domain green surrounded by an
integrin domain red 3 10 The pattern results from cytoskeletal
transport of TCRs towards the contact zone center 6 14  b Sim-
ulated nal pattern in the absence of TCR transport 14 The length
of the boundary line between the TCR and the integrin domain is
minimal in this pattern  c and d The two types of intermediate
patterns observed in the rst minutes of adhesion 11 In simula-
tions both patterns result from the nucleation of TCR clusters in the
rst seconds of adhesion and the subsequent diffusion of unbound
TCR and MHC-peptide ligands in the contact zone 14 The closed
TCR ring in pattern c forms from fast-growing TCR clusters in the
periphery of the contact zone at sufciently large TCR-MHC-peptide
concentrations The pattern d forms at smaller TCR-MHC-peptide
concentrations
zone see g 5d
To understand these patterns several groups have modeled
and simulated the adhesion of T cells and other immune cells
14 44 47 48 49 53 54 56 81 82 One open question
concerned the role of the T-cell cytoskeleton which polarizes
during adhesion with a focal point in the center of the con-
tact zone 1 83 Some groups have found that the nal T-cell
pattern with a central TCR domain can emerge independently
of cytoskeletal processes 47 81 In contrast Monte Carlo
simulations of discrete models indicate that the central TCR
cluster is only formed if TCR molecules are actively trans-
ported by the cytoskeleton towards the center of the contact
zone 14 The active transport has been simulated by a bi-
ased diffusion of TCRs towards the contact zone center which
implies a weak coupling of TCRs to the cytoskeleton In the
absence of active TCR transport the Monte Carlo simulations
lead to the nal equilibrium pattern shown in g 5b which
minimizes the energy of the boundary line between the TCR
and the integrin domain 14 In agreement with these simu-
lations recent T-cell adhesion experiments on patterned sub-
strates reveal cytoskeletal forces that drive the TCRs towards
the center of the contact zone 6 36 The experiments indi-
cate a weak frictional coupling of the TCRs to the cytoskeletal
ow 36
The intermediate patterns formed in the Monte Carlo sim-
ulations closely resemble the intermediate immune-cell pat-
terns shown in gs 5c and d In the rst seconds of ad-
abcd     Mfformation of TCR clustersno TCR clusters    Ms1  U ef
1 is larger than U ef
15 Second the effective potential U ef
1 for the TCR com-
plexes has to be larger than the effective depth U ef
2 in the sit-
uation where no TCRs are bound To understand the second
condition one has to realize that the concentrations of un-
bound TCRs and unbound integrins depend on the area frac-
tions of the TCR and integrin clusters and domains in the con-
tact zone If no TCRs are bound ie if the whole contact zone
is occupied by an integrin domain the concentration of un-
bound TCRs is maximal Hence also the effective depth U ef
for the TCRs is maximal in this situation see eq 3 TCR
clusters now form if U ef
2  which leads to a
decrease in the concentration of unbound TCRs and thus to a
decrease in U ef
1  The area fraction of the TCR clusters grows
until the equilibrium situation with U ef
2 is reached 15
T-cell activation requires a threshold concentration of for-
eign MHC-peptide complexes
Interestingly the threshold
concentration of foreign MHC-peptide depends on the con-
centration of self MHC-peptide complexes ie of complexes
between MHC and self peptides derived from proteins of the
host cell 95 96 The foreign MHC-peptide complexes in
contrast are complexes of MHC with peptides derived from
viral or bacterial proteins Self MHC-peptides typically bind
weakly to TCR since strong binding can result in autoimmune
reactions However the number of self MHC-peptide com-
plexes typically greatly exceed the number of foreign MHC-
peptide on cell surfaces Both self and foreign MHC-peptide
complexes contribute to the effective potential depth U ef
the TCR-MHC-peptide interaction For simplicity we assume
here a single dominant type of self MHC-peptides with con-
centrations Ms The effective potential depth then is
1  kBT T Mf KTMf  T MsKTMs    
where T  and Mf  are the concentrations of unbound TCR
and foreign MHC-peptide and KTMf and KTMs are the bind-
ing equilibrium constants of foreign and self TCR-MHC-
peptide complexes in the case of planar membranes see
eq 2 The dots in eq 16 indicate possible contributions
from other receptor-ligand complexes with the same length
as the TCR-MHC-peptide complex eg from the CD2-CD58
complex 17
In addition repulsive glycoproteins with a
length larger than TCR-MHC-peptide complex can affect U ef
14 56 Similarly the depth U ef
2 of the second well depends
on the concentrations and binding equilibrium constants of in-
tegrins and its ligands
Let us now suppose that the numbers of TCRs co-receptors
such as CD2 integrins and glycoproteins are approximately
equal for different T cells and apposing cells while the num-
bers of foreign and self MHC-peptides vary The second con-
dition U ef
2 for TCR cluster formation then leads to
Mf KTMf  MsKTMs  ct
1  U ef
where ct is a dimensionless threshold that depends on the
TCR co-receptor integrin and glycoprotein concentrations
etc The threshold concentration of foreign MHC-peptide
complexes for TCR cluster formation thus depends on the
concentration of self MHC-peptide complexes see g 6 If
the formation of TCR microclusters coincides with early ac-
tivation signals as suggested in Refs 89 90 the inequality
17 also helps to understand the joint role of foreign and self
MHC-peptides in T-cell activation

optimal volume fraction the particle coverage of two planar parallel membranes is close to 50 for large separations and almost 100 for
small separations at which the particles can bind to both surfaces 101
branes for example can be crosslinked by the connector
molecule streptavidin 7 97 The effective binding afnity
of the membranes then depends both on the area concentra-
tions of the membrane receptors and the volume concentra-
tion of the linker molecules A similar situation arises if ad-
hesive molecules or particles directly bind to lipid bilayers
98 99 100 The adhesive particles can crosslink two appos-
ing membranes if the membrane separation is close to the par-
ticle diameter see g 7b At large membrane separations
the particles can only bind to one of the membranes
The effective particle-mediated adhesion potential of the
membranes can be determined by integrating over all possi-
ble positions of the adhesive particles or linker molecules in
the partition function of the considered model Conceptually
this is similar to the calculation of the effective adhesion po-
tential for membranes interacting via anchored receptors and
ligands which requires an integration over all positions of the
receptor and ligand molecules in the membranes see section
II For simplicity we consider here the adhesive particles of
g 7b which interact directly with the lipid bilayers The
explicit integration over the particle positions requires spatial
discretizations In a lattice model the space between the ap-
posing membranes is discretized into a cubic lattice with a lat-
tice spacing equal to the particle diameter d 101 In an alter-
native semi-continuous model only the two spatial directions
parallel to the membranes are discretized while the third spa-
tial direction perpendicular to the membranes is continuous
101 In both models the effective particle-mediated adhe-
sion potential at large membrane separations has the form

The model-dependent factor q in eqs 18 and 19 has the
value 1 in the lattice gas model and the value rd in the semi-
continous model with interaction range r of the adhesive par-
ticles In the semi-continuous model the potential minimum
is located at the membrane separation l  d  r see g 7c
Independent of these two models the eqs 18 and 19 can
also be understood as Langmuir adsorption free energies per
binding site Eq 19 can be interpreted as the Langmuir ad-
sorption free energy for small membrane separations at which
a particle binds both membranes with total binding energy
2U and eq 18 as the Langmuir adsorption free energy for
large separations The Langmuir adsorption free energies re-
sult from a simple two-state model in which a particle is either
absent Boltzmann weight 1 or present Boltzmann weights

ume fraction has important implications that are accessible to
experiments such as re-entrant transitions in which surfaces
or colloidal objects rst bind with increasing concentration of
adhesive particles and unbind again when the concentration
is further increased beyond the optimal concentration

Some adhesion receptors can be switched between dif-
ferent conformations A biological example of switchable
membrane-anchored adhesion receptors are integrins In one
of their conformations the integrin molecules are extended
and can bind to apposing ligands 102 103 104 In another
conformation the molecules are bent and thus deactivated
The transitions between these conformations are triggered by
signaling cascades in the cells which typically require energy
input eg via ATP Because of this energy input the switching
process is an active non-equilibrium process In biomimetic
applications with designed molecules active conformational
transitions may also be triggered by light 105 106 Other ac-
tive processes of biomembranes include the forces exerted by
embedded ion pumps 107 108 109 110 111 112 or by the
cell cytoskeleton 113 114 see also section V B Active con-
formational transitions of membrane proteins have also been
suggested to couple to the local thickness 115 or curvature
116 of the membranes
In the absence of active processes the adhesiveness of
two membranes with complementary receptor and ligand
molecules depends on the concentration and binding ener-
gies of the molecules and can be captured by effective adhe-
sion potentials see section II The adhesiveness of membranes
with actively switched receptors in contrast depends also on
the switching rates of the receptors In the example illustrated
in g 9 the anchored receptors can be switched between two
states an extended on-state in which the receptors can bind
to ligands anchored in the apposing membrane and an off-
state in which the receptors cant bind In this example the
switching process from the on- to the off-state requires en-
ergy input eg in the form of ATP As a consequence the rate
 for this process does not depend on wether the receptor
is bound or not in contrast to equilibrium situations without
energy input In an equilibrium situation the rate for the tran-
sition from the on- to the off-state depends on the binding state
and binding energy of a receptor
The active switching of the receptors enhances the shape
uctuations of the membranes 117 118 119 Since the
steric repulsion of the membranes increases with the shape
uctuations this enhancement of shape uctuations leads to
larger membrane separations In Fig 9b the average mem-
brane separation is shown as a function of the switching rates
for equal on- and off-rates    In this example the
fractions of receptors in the on- and off-state are constant and
equal to 05 The active switching leads to a stochastic reso-
nance of the membrane shape uctuations with a maximum
of the membrane separation at intermediate switching rates
At the resonance point the switching rates are close to the
uctuation relaxation rate 1 of a membrane segment with
a linear size equal to the average separation of the receptors
FIG 9 Top A membrane with switchable receptors adhering to
a second membrane with complementary ligands The receptors
are switched between a stretched active conformation and a bent
inactive conformation
In the stretched conformation the adhe-
sion molecules can bind to their ligands in the apposing membrane
 Bottom Monte Carlo data for the average rescaled membrane
separation z  lapkBT as a function of the switching rate
     of the receptors Here  and  are the on-
and off-switching rates of the receptors and  is the characteristic
relaxation time of a membrane segment with a linear size equal to
the mean distance of the receptors The active switching leads to a
stochastic resonance with increased membrane separations at inter-
mediate switching rates The details of the Monte Carlo simulations
are described in Ref 117 In this example the binding energy of
the receptors and ligands is U  28kBT 
VIII DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have reviewed theoretical models for the adhesion of
biomimetic membranes and cells via anchored but mobile re-
ceptor and ligand molecules In these models the membranes
are described as elastic surfaces and the receptors and ligands
as single molecules We have argued in the introduction that
the elasticity of the membranes is dominated by their bend-
ing energy on the relevant lateral length scales up to average
separation of the receptor-ligand complexes which is between
50 and 100 nm for typical concentrations of the complexes in
cell adhesion zones 3 The crossover lengthcid112 above

which the tension  dominates over the bending rigidity 
is clearly larger for typical membrane tensions  see intro-
duction However the average separation of cytoskeletal an-
chors in cell membranes may be close to the average separa-
tion of the receptor-ligand complexes In the absence of active
processes the coupling of the membrane to the cytoskeleton
may lead to a suppression of membrane shape uctuations on
length scales larger than the average separation of the anchors
In the presence of active cytoskeletal processes the membrane
shape uctuations may even be increased 23 26 In the mod-
els reviewed here the cytoskeletal elasticity is neglected since
the relevant lateral length scales up to 50 or 100 nm are taken
to be smaller than the average separation of the cytoskeletal
anchors However the active transport of T cell receptors via
a weak coupling to the cytoskeleton has been taken into ac-
count in section V B and the active switching of receptors has
been considered in section VII The characterization of the
membrane elasticity by a uniform bending rigidity  is jus-
tied on length scales larger than the molecular components
of the membranes ie on length scales larger than 5 or 10
nm Molecular inhomogeneities within the membranes aver-
age out on these length scales and the presence of anchored
or embedded proteins leads to an increased bending rigidity
compared to pure lipid bilayers
Important length scales in the direction perpendicular to the
membranes are the length of the receptor-ligand complexes
and the binding range of the receptors and ligands The bind-
ing range is the difference between the smallest and largest
local membrane separation at which the molecules can bind
and depends on the interaction range of the molecular groups
that stick together the exibility of the receptor and ligand
molecules and the exibility of the membrane anchoring In
principle the binding range may be measured experimentally
or inferred from simulations with atomistic membrane models
in a multi-scale modeling approach An important quantity
is the fraction Pb of the membranes with a local separation
within the binding range of the receptors and ligands see sec-
tion III The membrane fraction Pb depends on the membrane
shape uctuations on the relevant nanoscales and thus on the
concentrations of the receptors and ligands which constrain
the shape uctuations as bound complexes The dependence
of Pb on the molecular concentrations leads to cooperative
binding
As reviewed in section II the integration over all possible
positions of the receptor and ligand molecules in the parti-
tion function of the models leads to effective adhesion poten-
tials for the membranes These effective adhesion potentials
greatly simplify the characterization of the adhesion behav-
ior In the case of long and short receptor-ligand complexes
for example the effective adhesion potential allows a general
characterization of the critical point for phase separation see
section V A If the adhesion is mediated by adsorbed particles
a similar integration over the degrees of freedom of these par-
ticles leads to an effective adhesion energy that is maximal at
an optimal particle concentration see section VI
