Abstract The evolution of galaxies in groups may have important implications for the global evolution
of star formation rate in the Universe since many processes which operate in groups may suppress
star formation and the fraction of galaxies bound in groups at the present day is as high as 60
We present an analysis of our sample of 03z055 groups selected from the CNOC2 redshift survey
and supplemented with deep spectroscopy and HST ACS imaging We nd that these groups contain
signicantly more passive galaxies than the eld with excesses of S0 elliptical and passive spiral galaxy
types The morphological composition is closely matched to that of more massive irregular clusters at a
similar epoch Contrasting with galaxy samples in a variety of environments and epochs we nd that the
fraction of passive galaxies EWOII5A is strongly evolving in the group environment with parallel
evolution in the global eld population whilst little evolution is observed in cluster cores since z  1
Introduction
Groups of galaxies represent the most common galaxy environment at z  0 containing as much as 60 of the
galaxy population at the present day 7 Due to their relatively low velocity dispersions groups of galaxies are
ideal sites for galaxy-galaxy interactions which are likely to give rise to signicant changes in the SFRs total
stellar masses and morphological appearance of galaxies Recent studies in the local Universe show that galaxy
properties are indeed inuenced by the group environment eg 2 Therefore understanding the evolutionary
processes in groups will probe not only the dependence of galaxy properties on environment but also trace the
importance of this common environment in driving global trends such as the strong decline in volumeaveraged
star formation since z  1 eg 14
Tracing galaxy evolution in groups requires the existence of higher redshift group catalogues Distant groups
have always been dicult to recognize because of their sparse galaxy populations The presence of high redshift
groups has typically been inferred indirectly via the presence of a radio galaxy or X-ray emitting intragroup
medium 1 11 However these selection criteria detect only the richest elliptical dominated groups To
reconcile this selection bias large spectroscopic eld surveys can be used to study galaxy groups selected purely
on the basis of their three dimensional galaxy density Such catalogues of groups now exist
2 The CNOC2 group sample at 03  z  055
The second Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Redshift Survey CNOC2 consists of U BV RC IC
photometry and spectroscopy measuring  104 galaxy redshifts up to z  06 24 This provided an powerful
opportunity to generate a kinematically selected sample of intermediate redshift galaxy groups A friends-of-
friends percolation algorithm was used to detect groups of galaxies in redshift space 4
This sample can be used to study the inuence of the typical group environment on galaxy properties at
intermediate redshift To this end we have recently obtained deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging of a
sub-sample of 261 CNOC2 groups with redshifts 03  z  055 when the Universe was  2
3 its present age
The original spectroscopy has been supplemented with deeper spectroscopy using the LDSS-2 spectrograph on
the Magellan 65-m telescope 22 and will be further supplemented by deep VLT FORS2 spectroscopy almost
complete at the time of writing reaching RC  232 M  3 at z  04 Combined with forthcomingongoing
observations at UV GALEX Near Infra-red SOFI on the ESO NTT and X-ray Chandra wavelengths we
are building a unique catalogue of galaxy groups combining signicant lookback time with the depth required
to probe the faint-end of the galaxy luminosity function and coverage across the electomagnetic spectrum
Magellan observations have extended the depth of our spectroscopic sample to RC  220 down to which
we have wellunderstood selection and no bias towards emissionline galaxies 22 Our combined group galaxy
sample numbers 282 galaxies in 26 separate groups at 03  z  0552 Within the area of deeper Magellan
coverage our spectroscopic sample also contains 334 serendipitous eld galaxies within this redshift range
1The 26 groups include 20 targetted groups and 6 serendipitous groups
2For further details of the Magellan spectroscopy and group membership allocation see Wilman et al 2005a 22
Throughout this paper we assume a CDM cosmology of M  03   07 and H0  75kms1Mpc1
3 Results and Analysis
The observed magnitudes of all galaxies in our sample are extinction corrected based upon the models of
Schlegel et al 1998 19 A best-t SED is computed using observed local SEDs 13 as templates and the
observed Rc-magnitude B-Ic colour and spectroscopic redshift of each galaxy The restframe bJ luminosity
MbJ is computed from the best-t SED This band is chosen because it closely matches the CNOC2 spectro-
scopic selection band Rc in the observedframe and it facilitates comparisons with the 2PIGG local group
catalogue
31 Star Formation and Evolution in CNOC2 Groups
To study the relative levels of star formation in statistical galaxy samples we use the OII3727 emission line
which lies centrally in the visible window at 03  z  055 and at wavelengths of low sky emission We note
that due to uncertainties in the calibration of star formation rates we deliberately limit our study to direct
comparisons between measurements of the Equivalent Width EW of OII Normalisation by the continuum
also reduces uncertainties related to absorption by dust and aperture bias
We are motivated by the clear bimodal distribution in colour and EWH eg 2 3 which show that the
fraction of red passive galaxies is strongly dependent upon local galaxy density To examine how the fraction
of passive galaxies depends upon environment in our sample we impose an arbitrary division at EWOII5A
We expect the population with EWOII5A to be dominated by passive galaxies and the population with
EWOII5A to be dominated by star-forming galaxies This division is sucient to reveal trends in statistical
samples eg 9 To assess the relative size of each population we dene fp to equal the weighted3 fraction of
galaxies with EWOII5A ie an estimator of the fraction of passive galaxies
Figure 1a shows how fp depends upon galaxy bJ-band luminosity in the group and eld samples The group
galaxy sample is limited to those within 1h1
75 Mpc of the luminosity-weighted group centroid There is a clear
enhancement of fp in the group galaxies with respect to the eld especially in the luminosity range 220 MbJ 
190 Combining all galaxies within the luminosity range 225 MbJ  185 the enhancement in groups
of fp is better than 3 signicance and this trend is still evident if the most massive two groups velocity
dispersion v  600 km s1 are excluded from the sample
We interpret the enhancement of fp in groups as direct evidence that galaxies in intermediate redshift groups
are signicantly less likely to have ongoing star formation than eld galaxies This could be a related to either
a dierent formation history in the group environment intragroup environmental processes accelerating galaxy
evolution to the passive state or a combination of these two eects We also note that their is a strong luminosity
dependence on fp in both group and eld samples such that a higher fraction of brighter galaxies are passive
by z04 This is consistent with the overall picture that more massive galaxies have formed all their stars at
earlier epochs
In Figure 1b we examine evolution in the cluster group and eld environments For our low redshift
sample we choose the 2dFGRS eld survey and the 2PIGG group catalogue 7 A detailed description of
sample selection and the comparison between CNOC2 and 2dFGRS data can be found in Wilman et al
2005b 23 The cluster core data are taken from Nakata et al 2005 164  originating in the 2dFGRS
CNOC1 and high redshift cluster samples of Van Dokkum et al 2000 21 and Postman et al 2001 18
These data are limited to within 075h1
75 Mpc of the cluster centres To match the Nakata et al 2005 16
sample we apply a luminosity limit of MbJ 1965 to all data This gure neatly illustrates the strength
of evolution observed for fp in groups and the eld whilst galaxies in dense cluster cores were already largely
passive by z  1
32 Morphological Composition of CNOC2 Groups
With deep HST ACS Hubble Space Telescope - Advanced Camera for Surveys F775W lter observations of
our CNOC2 groups we have the resolving power to classify galaxy morphologies to well below the magnitude
limit of our spectroscopy In this way we can isolate the morphological transformations which may be driving
galaxy evolution in groups at intermediate redshift
To date a sub-sample of galaxies from the rst 16 ACS elds have been morphologically classied visually by
Augustus Oemler Jnr AO 5 Galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the 03  z  055 redshift range were
3Galaxy weights are computed to account for incompleteness in the sample See Wilman et al 2005a 22 for a derivation of
selection functions and weights in this sample
4Note that whilst in that paper a 10A division in EWOII is used we maintain consistent use of a 5A limit
5We acknowledge that the analysis presented here is merely preliminary as the classications will be extended to the full sample
and classications by more than one author will be used to assess the robustness of the classication process

and 18 Cluster data are selected only within the inner 075h1
75 Mpc of the cluster centre and we match the
luminosity limit of 16 MbJ  1965 This gure shows the strong decline of fp in the Universe since z  04
in groups and the eld whilst the passive population in the dense core regions of clusters is consistent with
having been mostly in place since z  1
visually classied according to the MORPHS classication scheme 20 The current sample of morphologically
classied CNOC2 galaxies includes 158 group and 124 eld galaxies
 210 210 MbJ
To assess the statistical signicance of dierences between the morphological composition of group and eld
samples we bin the galaxies into four broad morphological classes These are Elliptical S0 Spiral and Other
mostly Irregular and merger types In Figure 2 we show the fraction of galaxies of each morphological type
 200 200 MbJ  1856 The solid line with
ftype in 3 bins of luminosity MbJ
the lled circles represents the group galaxy population and the dashed line with the open circles represents the
eld population It shows that whilst spiral galaxies dominate the eld galaxy population there is a signicant
decit of spirals in galaxy groups 3 computed for all galaxies MbJ  185 In the place of these spirals
there is an excess of early-type galaxies in groups There is a 27 excess of ellipticals and a 13 excess of S0
type galaxies in total Figure 2 indicates that the elliptical excess is most signicant at faint luminosities where
the eld elliptical population is less important However at brighter luminosities the S0 population seems to
 205 there are 16 group and no eld S0 type
become very important in groups In fact brighter than MbJ
galaxies We compute the fraction of S0 galaxies in this luminosity range to be fS0  023 in the groups A
bootstrap-resampling technique is then used to estimate the signicance of this excess with respect to fS0  0
in the eld We nd that there is a  35 excess of bright S0s in groups Finally we also note that bright
S0s appear to be particularly predominant in groups with velocity dispersions of  400 km s1 Indeed six
of these galaxies are located in just two groups 3 in group 37 v  419  97 km s1 and 3 in group 39
v  454  88 km s1 suggesting that the formation of bright S0 galaxies appears to be biased towards a
certain type of group environment as represented by these groups
A comparison with the z  05 MORPHS cluster sample of Dressler et al
1997 6 indicates that
our groups match the morphological composition of the irregular MORPHS clusters  40 spirals  40
ellipticals and  20 S0s This suggests that the morphological mix of unvirialised clusters is likely to be
already in place during the infalling group stage
Another interesting class of galaxy is the Passive Spiral These galaxies are still morphologically spiral-
type but with no sign of ongoing star formation in our case EWOII5A Passive spirals have typically
aroused interest in cluster studies where they have often been interpreted to be infalling spiral galaxies in
which star formation has been somehow truncated without any morphological transformation up to the point
of observation eg
5 17 Figure 3a shows fp as a function of luminosity only for galaxies which are
morphologically classied spirals 67 in groups 68 in the eld At brighter luminosities MbJ  200 the
population of spiral galaxies is clearly more passive in groups solid line lled circles than the eld dashed
line open circles This excess is assessed at 32 signcance using a resampling method Interestingly the
lack of any passive spiral excess in fainter galaxies suggests that interactions with the IGM are unlikely to be

the group galaxy population and the dashed line with the open circles represents the eld population Errors
are estimated using the Jackknife technique and eld points are oset slightly in MbJ for clarity This gure
clearly shows that the CNOC2 groups possess a larger fraction of early galaxy types elliptical and S0 than
the eld in place of spiral galaxies more common in the eld
responsible since less massive galaxies have smaller gravitational potential wells and thus should lose their gas
more easily In the right-hand panels of Figure 3 we examine whether fp in bright MbJ  200 spiral galaxies
has any dependence upon its group-centric radius dr b and group-centric radius normalised by the rmsdr
for the parent group c
It is clear that a larger fraction of spiral galaxies are passive towards the group
centre and that this relation holds when the radial distance is normalised by the typical group-centric radius
of each group This indicates that processes leading to the ceasation of star formation in bright spiral galaxies
are tightly related to the group environment However we note that we nd no passive spiral in the two most
massive groups v 600 km s1 Since passive galaxies in local clusters seem to be found predominantly in
the cluster outskirts 8 we believe passive spirals are therefore most likely to be found in environments typical
of smaller groups and the outskirts of clusters
4 Conclusions
We have presented an analysis of galaxy properties in the group and eld environments at intermediate redshift
03  z  055 This is part of an ongoing study of how the group environment inuences galaxy evolution
Our main conclusions to date can be summarized as follows
 Whist massive galaxies were largely passive in cluster cores by z  1 there has been strong evolution in
the fraction of passive galaxies fp in groups and the eld since z  04 This must be important when
considering the global budget of star formation
 Galaxies in CNOC2 groups are more likely to be passive or bulge-dominated than in the CNOC2 eld
 However the morphological composition of the z 04 group population matches that of the irregular
MORPHS clusters at similar redshift
 Excesses of bright S0s and passive spirals in CNOC2 groups relates the 2 galaxy types and suggests that
the S0 formation process may favour groups These excesses are not found fainter than  M and so
interactions with the IGM are unlikely to be responsible
