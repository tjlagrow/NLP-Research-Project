ABSTRACT
Context The Hubble tuning fork diagram has always been the preferred scheme for classication of galaxies It is based on morphology only
At the opposite biologists have long taken into account the genealogical relatedness of living entities for classication purposes
Aims Assuming branching evolution of galaxies as a descent with modication we show here that the concepts and tools of phylogenetic
systematics widely used in biology can be heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies
Methods This approach that we call astrocladistics is applied to Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group and provides the rst evolutionary tree
for real galaxies
Results The trees that we present here are suciently solid to support the existence of a hierarchical organization in the diversity of dwarf
galaxies of the Local Group This also shows that these galaxies all derive from a common ancestral kind of objects We nd that some kinds of
dIrrs are progenitors of both dSphs and other kinds of dIrrs We also identify three evolutionary groups each one having its own characteristics
and own evolution
Conclusions The present work opens a new way to analyze galaxy evolution and a path towards a new systematics of galaxies Work on other
galaxies in the Universe is in progress
Key words Galaxies fundamental parameters  Galaxies evolution  Galaxies formation
1 Introduction
Since Hubble 1922 1926 classication of galaxies relies largely on morphology spirals attened galaxies with spiral arms
barred spirals ellipticals galaxies with no obvious pattern and irregulars Kormendy  Bender 1996 Roberts  Haynes 1994
Subdivisions have been created since then de Vaucouleurs 1959 Sandage 1961 in an attempt to transform morphology into
a more quantitative parameter The use of a limited number of additional charactersradio and X-ray properties environment
nucleus activity gas content star formation colours and othershas led to the recognition of numerous classes which are essen-
tially catalogues of objects This traditional approach of classication might look inadequate to describe the now acknowledged
complexity of galaxies Multivariate analysis of these characters has been once proposed to tackle the problem of synthesizing the
classicatory information brought by independent characters Whitmore 1984 Watanabe et al 1985 However these approaches
remain based on overall similarities estimations
Indeed galaxies are complex systems in which several physical and chemical processes govern the evolution of their basic
constituents stars gas dust molecules and probably black holes eg Vilchez et al 2001 Surprisingly besides Hubbles primer
hypotheses on the evolution of galaxies leading to the famous Hubble or tuning fork diagram Hubble 1936 there has been no
further attempt to ground classication of galaxies on historicalevolutionary relationships Nowadays the physical and chemical
processes are individually often roughly understood and sometimes well modelled eg Sauvage et al 2002 but they are not
collectively integrated and grasping the causes of galaxy diversity in their entire complexity remains a dicult task

Similar concerns have already been addressed in the study of biological diversity Nearly 150 years ago Darwin 1859
suggested that the hierarchical classication of living organisms should reect their genealogical relationships This was an
incredibly successful idea that drove biological systematics into a new era There is now a common agreement that a natural
classication should be derived from phylogenetic trees ie a branching structure describing the evolutionary relationships of a
set of biological entities or taxa Wiley et al 1991 Accordingly the concepts and methods of phylogenetic systematics have been
successfully applied to other sets of entities for which historical or evolutionary relationships could be documented examples
are found in linguistics Wells 1987 and stemmatics Robinson  Robert 1996
We therefore hypothesize that galaxies can be classied in a natural hierarchy of nested groups reecting evolution Our
purpose is thus to introduce the parameter time in the classication scheme using all available and suitable descriptive char-
acters and to propose an integrated way to represent galaxy diversity We named this approach astrocladistics Fraix-Burnet
et al 2003 Fraix-Burnet 2004 The method and associated concepts are presented in detail elsewhere together with an analy-
sis of two samples of simulated galaxies Fraix-Burnet et al 2006a 2006b In this paper we present the rst application of
astrocladistics on real galaxies We chose to focus on the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group for which a reasonable amount of
complete and homogeneous data were available According to the hierarchical scenario1 of galaxy formation these galaxies
could belong to small dark matter halos that are the building blocks of larger structures that may host big galaxies In this respect
dwarf galaxies are not considered to be formed by the merging of smaller structures but because of the relatively shallow grav-
itational well they are certainly subject to disturbances and sweeping However this hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation
has some diculties like predicting too many small structures which are not seen in the form of dwarf galaxies eg Moore
et al 1999 Venn et al 2004 The Local Group could also represent an evolutionary microcosm where the environments have
been somewhat similar for all the dwarfs Here we scored a variety of characters and inferred the most parsimonious history that
describes the evolution of Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group
2 Methods
21 Conceptualframework
A cornerstone of phylogenetic systematics is to focus on derived character states to infer common ancestry relationships
Hennig 1965 Such characters may be viewed as evolutionary novelties appearing in a particular lineage It is assumed that
1 This is not to be confused with the hierarchical organisation of galaxy diversity dealt with in this paper

Consistency Index068 Retention Index075 Rescaled Consistency Index051 Numbers at each node are bootstrap above
and decay below values Bootstrap percentages are obtained after 1000 resampling of characters Decay indexes correspond to

two closely relative objects also called taxa because they can be individuals groups or species share derived characters which
presumably originate in their common ancestor Regarding classication phylogenetic systematics denes clades evolutionary
groups as groupings that are signicant with respect to evolution in the sense that they contain all ospring from a common
ancestor and their members share common derived states that is to say a common history
Now lets consider two identical galaxies hence belonging to the same class If they evolve independently and isolated the
number of processes at work within each galaxy makes it probable that after a given time they will be dierent enough to be put
into two dierent classes For instance if they were both of spiral shape they will remain as such but one could have developed a
bar or had a starburst activity modifying its stellar population In addition galaxies live in an environment made of intergalactic
gas and gravitational potential fashioned by dark matter and other galaxies Sauvage et al 2002 If two galaxies interact with
each other the dynamics will most of the time be aected dierently in both because of asymmetries in the encounter so that
they could then be put in two separate classes In all cases one class gives birth to at least two classes This is the denition of
branching evolution Its driver is mainly the randomness of external interactions and to a lesser extent that of internal processes
This branching evolution results in a hierarchical or tree-like organisation of the diversity
All details on astrocladistics are given in Fraix-Burnet et al 2006a 2006b
22 Data
We used data from Mateo 1998 on 36 galaxies and identied 25 characters For each character we discretized the whole range
of values in up to 8 bins plus the unknown value 2 These are assumed to be evolutionary states For instance if we accept that
metallicity increases with time then a very low value would be an ancestral state whereas a high value would be a derived state
This has to be adapted to the sample under study We imposed 15 characters to be ordered see Table 1 ie changes between
two adjacent states are more probable than between distant ones independently from the sense of the change The morphological
character dIrr Intermediate and dSph was discarded in the analysis because it notably diers from the other ones in being the
only qualitative property and somewhat subjectively dened It was coded into three states merely for projection onto the result
trees We thus ended up with a matrix of 36 objects described by 24 characters the total percentage of unknown values being
The outgroup used to root the tree ie to orientate the evolutionary processes indicates the ancestral states of the char-
acters for which transformation can be hypothesized within a reasonably accepted paradigm Given the complicated evolutionary
behaviour of Dwarf galaxies for this rst astrocladistics analysis we decided to choose a galaxy of the sample The advantage is
that the result tree can be easily rerooted with any of the sample objects depending on ones own guess because the structure of
the tree does not change SagDIG is chosen here as root because it has the highest ratio MHIM of the sample It is interesting to
note that SagDIG seems to be at the verge of our Local Group van den Bergh 2000
23 Treeconstruction
An important aspect of phylogenetic systematics is to avoid the grouping of objects based on similarities due to evolutionary
convergences or reversals In phylogenetic analysis maximum parsimony Fitch 1971 is one optimality criterion for selecting
among competing trees It states that the most probable evolutionary scenario is the simplest one as measured by the total
number of character state changes called steps The most parsimonious tree thus corresponds to the simplest evolution scenario
compatible with all the input data The use of the parsimony principle also minimises the number of convergences or reversals
We used maximum parsimony to identify the tree best representing our data matrix Since there is an important number of
unknown values in the data the full tree obtained with the 36 galaxies is not extremely robust in the sense that slightly dierent
trees could also t the data To assess its signicance we thus looked for smaller trees and kept the more robust one we can nd
with a subsample as large as possible The evaluation of the reliability of tree nodes was made through bootstrap percentages of
node occurence obtained after 1000 resampling of characters Felsenstein 1985 and decay minimum number of character-state
changes to be added to tree length to break the corresponding node Bremer 1994 estimates All calculations were conducted
with PAUP40b10 Swoord 1998 and the tree interpretation was done with Mesquite Maddison  Maddison 2004
3 Results
We found a fully resolved tree with 14 galaxies Fig 1 It has a total of 167 steps character state changes bootstrap and decay
values are high for nearly all nodes Fig 1 indicating that most tree nodes are strongly supported by the data No better trees
could be found with 14 or more objects Regarding the groupings and evolutionary behaviours of characters that is the resulting
phylogeny all robust trees we found with 14 or slightly less galaxies are all compatible as they are with the full tree discussed

D Fraix-Burnet et al Towards a Phylogenetic Analysis of Galaxy Evolution
Performing an analysis with the full sample of 36 galaxies 1041 most parsimonious trees were found each having 317 steps
The strict consensus of all of them is shown in Fig 2 It is remarkably well resolved despite the important number of unknown
values The strict consensus means that the nodes present on the tree are found in all the 1041 individual trees We must warn that
this tree is not as robust regarding bootstrap and decay estimators as the previous one so that its very detailed structure should be
taken with some caution However the two trees are fully compatible and the character behaviours as will be discussed below
are identical pointing toward the same evolutionary history of diversication
Generally speaking a galaxy situated far from the root SagDIG is more dierentiated from it It is not necessarily more
evolved since it depends on the timescale of each evolutionary process see 2006a 2006b for a more complete discussion In this
paper for simplication at the level of the discussion and because we lack an evolutionary clock we will identify diversication
and evolution
The very existence of resolved and robust trees implies that all these galaxies share a common ancestor with respect to
SagDIG that is they all derive from the same kind of objects In addition diversity in the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group
arranges itself in a hierarchical way
Five groups are identied in Fig 2 and dened in Table 2 These groups correspond to structures on the tree mainly lineages
except GU which gathers a set of unresolved branches for convenience in the discussion After SagDIG the root of the tree there
are four groups with unresolved respective phylogenies GU GA1 GA2 and GB GB1 and GB2 plus the pair GR 8DDO 210 In
contrast the branch after Pegasus diverges in two clear subtrees GB1 and GB2 which are by the way the most diversied from
SagDIG among the whole sample There are three pairs within GB2 LGS 3Antlia Ursa MinorDraco and SextansCarina On
the small tree Fig 1 the phylogeny is fully resolved and the above groups are present with at least one object representative of
each indicated in Table 2 After the branch toward Leo A there are only two diverging branches one leading to GA1 then GA2
the other one nally leading to another binary bifurcation toward GB1 and GB2 Note that GA 1 and 2 and GB2 have very high
bootstrap and decay values indicating that they probably constitute true evolutionary group The support for GB1 is somewhat
less but still very signicant In other words the small tree of Fig 1 is a phylogeny of the groups dened in Table 2
The reasons for the tree structure lies in the evolution of the characters Their values are projected onto the larger tree in
Fig 3 in order to visualize both the character evolution and the group properties The latter are summarized in Table 2 It appears
that except for GU which by construction cannot be considered to form an evolutionary group because the relative placement of
galaxies in GU is unknown groups can be unambiguously characterized by a set of properties The three groups GA2 GB1 and
GB2 have unique characteristics Group GA1 resembles GA2 but lacks a high V luminosity Following the small tree in Fig 1
these two groups are related implying an increase in V luminosity with evolution along this branch It is dicult to conclude
with the present data whether they are one or two dierent lineages
On the contrary there are undoubtedly two species identied by the two groups GB1 and GB2 In the rst case galaxies
are specically bright in V have a high central mass density but a low central ratio ML together with a low MHIBlum In the
second case galaxies are of low V luminosity with a high and increasing along this branch central ratio ML a decreasing
MHIBlum and may be more importantly a very low metallicity FeH
Assuming that SagDIG as the root of the tree resembles the common ancestor to Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group a few
characters seem to evolve regularly with the evolutionary scenario revealed by our tree colours B-V and U-B might globally
increase while MHIM the HI mass MHIBLum might decrease But the structure of the tree is not very regular and most
characters like the V luminosity the total mass or the dust mass have dierent behaviours depending on the branches Hence
the tree structure is explained by multiple parameters together with possibly a very few global evolutionary trends The seemingly
complex history of diversity in this sample might be due to the particular nature of dwarf galaxies and this shows that the dierent
evolutionary stages cannot be established with only one or two descriptors
This statement could seem to be contradicted by the morphology behaviour as can be seen on the corresponding projection
in Fig 3 Despite this character was not used to build the tree a perfect dichotomy appears between galaxies before Pegasus
dIrrs with groups GU GA1 and GA2 and after it dSphs with groups GB1 and GB2 This galaxy is of intermediate type
Interestingly our 14-galaxy tree Fig 1 diverges after Pegasus into two groups one of which is composed exclusively with
three other intermediate-class galaxies Antlia LGS 3 Phoenix But it corresponds to GB2 Fig 2 which also have dSphs The
last intermediate-type galaxy DDO 210 is paired with GR 8 among the dIrrs As clearly demonstrated by the structure of the
tree the dichotomy dSph-dIrr is far too simplistic to represent the diversity of dwarf galaxies even solely in the Local Group
and misses all groups identied in this paper that are based on the information included in 24 characters Indeed spheroidal
galaxies are all gathered in the group GB These galaxies constitute a separate evolutionary lineages and Fig 1 stipulates more
precisely that they derived from ancestors of irregular morphologies However this is not enough to depict the diversity and
evolutionary history of these galaxies since there are probably at least two kinds of irregulars and certainly two rather dierent
kinds of spheroidals The character projections Fig 3 illustrate the well known fact that the spheroidal dwarf galaxies have lost
their HI gas but goes further in describing with more detail the several kinds of evolutionary groups identied above

4 Discussion
The trees show a hierarchical organization of the Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group with well identied evolutionary groups
This result is particularly remarkable since these galaxies evolve in the same microcosm which probably mean less diversity But
more importantly the two main hypothesis of astrocladistics a common ancestor and a hierarchical organisation of diversity are
thus veried The present result strongly stimulates the use of this approach to other galaxies as is currently under progress
The existence of a hierarchy in galaxy diversity makes it possible to track ancestral types of galaxies Our result shows that
the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group very probably have a common ancestor meaning that they derive from the same kind of
objects This seems to be in contradiction with Ricotti  Gnedin 2005 who assume two dierent initial formation processes
for irregulars and spheroidals Even though SagDIG is supposed here to resemble the common ancestor of our sample it is
impossible to tell how much it resembles the common ancestor of all dwarf galaxies Study of much more objects is needed
However our result might not be incompatible with Ricotti  Gnedins result since it depends on the denition of both ancestor
object and formation concept see Fraix-Burnet et al 2006a 2006b In addition dwarfs are currently thought to form within
small dark matter structures but this formation process is far from being understood and even denitively established
Assuming dierent stellar formation histories Ricotti  Gnedin dene three groups survivors true and polluted fossils
Only the true fossils correspond relatively well to one of our groups GB2 except for Carina LGS 3 and Leo II that they classify
D Fraix-Burnet et al Towards a Phylogenetic Analysis of Galaxy Evolution
as polluted fossils But our classication lies on other descriptors than only the stellar population In the same manner Grebel
2005 presents a diagram tentatively summarizing the history of dwarf spheroidals based on star formation episodes If we
compare the exemplar galaxies of her categories with our tree we nd that Draco old and Carina episodic both belong
to GB2 Fornax and Phoenix both young belong respectively to GB1 and GB2 and Leo I intermediate is close to Fornax
Again the two classications do not match for the same reason as above indicating that the star formation history is certainly
insucient to depict the whole diversity of the Dwarf galaxies On the contrary our data may be inadequate to characterize the
stellar population in detail Since an astrocladistics analysis reects the knowledge at a given epoch and is thus never nished
extension of the present work in the future will have to include more descriptors as they become available for most of the galaxies
Because the cladogram recapitulates evolutionary information of several characters we think it could give a better insight on
possible caveats of wordings like young galaxy and old galaxy All the galaxies of the sample are contemporaneous but some
resembles more the ancestor than others that is they look like old species They are not necessarily old objects Likewise
galaxies at the bottom of the tree are more diversied but cannot be said younger For instance Ursa Minor is often believed
to have little evolved Mateo 1998 Carrera et al 2002 Mighell 1999 because it has old stars At the opposite IC 10 have had a
strong and recent starburst activity Mateo 1998 Wilcots  Miller 1998 From our cladistic analysis it would be meaningless
to qualify one younger than the other rather Ursa Minor seems to be more diversied from the ancestor as compared to IC 10
They do belong to two dierent species each with its own evolutionary pathway that diverged sometime in the history of these
galaxies and all their progenitors see Fraix-Burnet et al 2006a 2006b Hence we think it is tricky to speak of old or young
galaxies based on star formation history alone It is much preferable to refer to the stage of diversication
The evolution of dwarf galaxies of the Local Group is often reduced to the segregation between dIrrs and dSphs see eg
Mateo 1998 For instance one explanation for the depletion of HI gas in dSphs could be the proximity of a big galaxy In Fig 3
each galaxy name has a colour corresponding to the sub-group to which it belongs Mateo 1998 All members of the Milky Way
family are spheroidals but they do not belong to the same evolutionary group There is no clear correlation with distance to the
Milky way For the M31 Andromeda family the four closest satellites M32 NGC 205 NGC 147 et NGC 185 are grouped
together in GB1 with among some others Sagittarius a very close satellite of our Milky Way The other members are spread
all over the tree with EGC042763 and IC 10 being in GU and GA2 respectively The NGC 3109 family is spread over the tree
while the Local Group Cloud members are spread over GU GA1 GA2 and even GB2 for Tucana Note that SagDIG belongs to
this last family but is certainly the farthest member of the Local Group being at its verge van den Bergh 2000 Our conclusion
is that the measured distance to a big galaxy is not enough to explain the diversity of the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group even
though companions of the two big galaxies of our Local Group nearly all belong to the groups GB1 and GB2 together with only
three more isolated objects One must keep in mind that the measured distance is the current distance while the properties of
galaxies are the result of a long history along a probably complicated trajectory that saw this distance change considerably
Another example is given by conclusions like dIrrs being unlikely progenitors of dSphs eg Grebel 2005 This kind of
statement ignores the complexity of galaxies and their evolution Comparing the two morphological types globally cannot be
successful due to the large variety of objects within each class see eg Mateo 1998 The tree on Fig 2 and the character
projections Fig 3 illustrates that the evolutionary stage of a galaxy cannot reasonably be assessed with the sole morphology
criterion Our result rather shows that some kinds of dIrrs are progenitors of both dSphs and other kinds of dIrrs that diverged
and developed their own lineage
Our choice of SagDIG as root provides a globally satisfactory evolutionary scenario This choice could easily be changed
without modifying the structure of the tree but then the interpretation would be dierent Regularity of evolution was imposed
to some characters Sect 22 Table 1 but this constraint does not imply monotonic behaviours as can be seen on the tree
Fig 3 Sect 3 More importantly characters can evolve dierently in dierent lineages For instance the V luminosity regularly
increases in GB1 while it decreases in GB2 making a global evolutionary behaviour quite complex and of poor signicance
We have identied at least three evolutionary groups Table 2 The rst one GA2 is composed of massive galaxies with a
high star formation rate lot of HI gas and dust high uxes of HI CO and H and a high ratio between rotational and dispersion
velocities The second one GB1 has relatively red galaxies high U-B with an increasing central mass concentration and a
decreasing central ML while the ratio MHIB luminosity is low The third one GB2 has galaxies with low and decreasing V
luminosity an increasing central ML a decreasing MHIB luminosity and a low FeH In summary the group GA2 is rather
active and massive GB1 accretes gas toward its center and increases its global V luminosity and GB2 looks like a dead end
with gas-poor galaxies with decreasing V luminosity These are three dierent evolutionary paths grouping objects with similar
histories that models will have to understand
Since it is based on observational data the evolutionary scenario depicted by the tree is globally consistent with current
thoughts about dwarf history and physics eg Mateo 1998 Carrera et al 2002 Wilcots  Miller 1998 Gallagher  Wyse 1994
It has the advantage of being built without choosing some particular parameters and is the unique way to synthesise the informa-
tion contained in such a multivariate problem In addition astrocladistics introduces the evolution in the analysis itself providing
a direct view of the diversication process
The results are based on the data and naturally depends on their quality in particular on distance estimations of galaxies
Regarding error bars in the original data it is not expected that they bring much noise in the result because initial quantitative
data are binned coded In the same manner the eect of any aberrant point is smoothed out in the analysis since the result is
D Fraix-Burnet et al Towards a Phylogenetic Analysis of Galaxy Evolution
a synthesis of all the input information In any case a cladistics analysis has this invaluable quality of being entirely transparent
and falsiable so that it is always possible to modify original values modify the way the coding is done introduce weights to
characters and compare the resulting phylogenies
5 Conclusion
We conclude that branching evolution is the dominant diversication process among the 36 Dwarf Galaxies of the Local Group
since the diversity is organized in a tree-like or hierarchical way Phylogenetic systematics is thus applicable to astrophysics and
provides a powerful tool to apprehend galaxy formation and evolution The tree depicts relationships between galaxies by taking
into account physical and chemical character changes It thus provides the opportunity to formulate new inferences on galaxy
evolution by providing a synthetic view of current knowledge
We have identied at least three dierent evolutionary groups each one having its own characteristics and own evolution one
is composed of massive and star forming galaxies another one has galaxies that seem to increase the luminosity while transferring
mass toward their centre and the last one looks like the dead-end of dwarf galaxy evolution with dimming and concentrating
objects
Morphology classication appears to be too simplistic to understand the evolution of dwarf galaxies From the trees we have
found we derive that some kinds of dIrrs are progenitors of both dSphs and other kinds of dIrrs Two of our evolutionary groups
are composed of dSphs the other one of dIrrs the intermediate type being spread over the tree
We must stress that the phylogeny found is entirely based on the data input The best way to avoid introducing a subjective
bias is to consider all available characters excluding obviously redundant ones as is done in phylogenetic systematics As new
data andor new characters become available and introduced in the analysis the current phylogeny might change somewhat
in the future This is normal process of knowledge progress In the particular case of the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group
spectrophotometric observations will certainly be invaluable for astrocladistics but this would ideally require homogeneous data
on a signicant sample to be available
Extension of this study to much more types of galaxies in the Universe is in progress and will possibly yield the basis for a
new taxonomy of galaxies

Fig 3 Colour coded projection of characters with the convention that the white code is always the lowest value of the corre-
sponding parameter Small squares at the leaves before galaxy name indicate a documented value for that character The other
leaves are given a value deduced from a parsimony analysis providing a prediction for the corresponding galaxy Colour code
for galaxy names is given at the end of gure Morphology is plotted but was not used to derive the tree
