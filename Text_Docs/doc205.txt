ABSTRACT
Context Galaxy mass and environment are known to play a key role in galaxy evolution studying galaxy colors as a function of
redshift galaxy mass and environment oers a powerful diagnosis to disentangle the role of each
AimsWe study the simultaneous dependence of the fraction of blue galaxies fblue on secular evolution environment and galaxy mass
with a well-controlled cluster sample We are thus able to study the evolution and respective role of the cessation of star formation
history SFH in clusters caused by galaxy mass mass quenching or by environment environmental quenching
Methods We dened an homogenous X-ray selected cluster sample 25 clusters with 0  z  1 and one cluster at z  22
having similar masses and well-dened sizes Using multicolor photometry and a large spectroscopic sample to calibrate photometric
redshifts we carefully estimated fblue for each cluster at dierent galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance bins We then tted the
dependence of fblue on redshift z environment rr200 and galaxy mass M with a simple model
03 decreases with galaxy mass with a slope   3806
Results fblue increases with cluster-centric distance with a slope   1204
05
and increases with redshift with a slope   3207
05 The data also require for the rst time a dierential evolution with galaxy mass
of fblue with redshift with lower mass galaxies evolving slower by a factor   4111

Conclusions Our study shows that the processes responsible for the cessation of star formation in clusters are eective at all epochs
z  22 and more eective in denser environments and for more massive galaxies We found that the mass and environmental
quenchings are separable that environmental quenching does not change with epoch and that mass quenching is a dynamical process
ie its evolutionary rate is mass-dependent Our study extends the downsizing-like scenario where the most massive galaxies have
their properties set at a very high redshift to the cluster environment and all galaxies It illustrates the need to disentangle galaxy mass
and cluster-centric distance to properly estimate the behavior of fblue in clusters

1 Introduction
It is well-established that galaxy mass and environment are key
parameters in shaping galaxy properties eg Butcher  Oemler
1978 Dressler 1980 De Propris et al 2003 At least in the
local Universe both change galaxy properties in a simi-
lar direction for instance making them preferentially redder
eg Visvanathan  Sandage 1977 Butcher  Oemler 1978 or
of early-type morphology eg Blanton et al 2003 Dressler
1980 Furthermore there is a correlation between galaxy mass
and environment because denser environments tend to be
inhabited by more massive galaxies eg Hogg et al 2003
Baldry et al 2006 In the local Universe the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS York et al 2000 provided data from which one
could quantify the role of each to an unprecedented precision
eg Kaumann et al 2004 Peng et al 2010
However when considering higher redshifts z  1-2 the
analysis is complicated  and additionally there are less data
available  by the disentangling of the precise role of secular
galaxy evolution of galaxy mass and of environment on galaxy
properties Therefore any analysis of galaxy evolution at z  1-
2 needs to simultaneously control for galaxy secular evolution
galaxy mass and environment Indeed any bias in one of those
three terms may confuse the interpretation of the obtained re-
sult For instance a blueing related to a younger age at higher
redshift may be mistaken for a blueing induced by a sampling
biased preferentially toward lower density environments which
are richer in blue galaxies
Controlling for galaxy mass requires working with galaxy
mass-selected samples which presents the advantage of a bet-
ter control of the sample Indeed galaxy mass has on average
a much more regular evolution increasing with decreasing red-
shift than galaxy rest-frame optical luminosity which can tem-
porarily increase with starbust and then decrease For example
a sample selected on rest-frame optical luminosity is very likely
to be biased toward those temporary low-mass starbust galaxies
at high redshifts thus introducing a spurious increase in the frac-
tion of blue galaxies that disappears if a mass-selected sample is
used eg De Propris et al 2003 A more subtle question is the
mass evolution of star-forming galaxies that will signicantly in-
crease their stellar mass with time For example an average star
formation rate of 2 M yr1 resp 5 M yr1 for 5 Gyr resp 2
Gyr is sucient to build 1010M Therefore selecting galaxies
by stellar mass measured at the galaxy redshift may introduce
a net inow with decreasing redshift of galaxies that rise above
the mass threshold adopted for the study This uncontrolled in-
ow with decreasing redshift of galaxies in the selected sample
leaves the ambiguity between a real evolution of massive blue
galaxies and a selection eect To remove this ambiguity one
needs to control for mass not at the redshift of observation but
evolved at z  0 to select at high redshift the likely ancestors of

present-day galaxies of a given mass eg Andreon et al 2008
Raichoor  Andreon 2012
Controlling for secular evolution requires acknowledging
that the galaxy rest-frame color evolves with time Indeed galax-
ies observed at higher redshifts will on average have bluer rest-
frame colors than their local counterparts because of their mean
younger age and of the higher mean star formation activity of the
Universe at higher redshifts eg Lilly et al 1996 Madau et al
1998 Using a non-evolving rest-frame color will classify an
increasing number with increasing redshift of red-sequence
galaxies as blue galaxies thus possibly introducing a spuri-
ous evolutionary trend One can take this into account by us-
ing evolving rest-frame colors to characterize galaxy proper-
ties at dierent redshifts as proposed by Andreon et al 2006
and now adopted in several works eg Haines et al 2009
Peng et al 2010 Raichoor  Andreon 2012
Controlling for environment raises the question of how to
measure environment Available data often oblige us to use a
proxy for an environment estimate based on samples with either
photometric redshift or that are rest-frame B-band luminosity-
selected However at z  1-2 these proxies may be either prone
to large uncertainties or potentially biased toward temporarily
blue overdensities Again this may introduce spurious trends
or smooth existing ones for instance see discussion in 3 of
Quadri et al 2012 In this regard clusters of galaxies are ideal
laboratories On the one hand their cores unambiguously rep-
resent the densest environment in the Universe at each epoch
where environmental processes consequently are the most eec-
tive On the other hand they provide at xed redshift handy
samples of galaxies observed in similar conditions with lit-
tle contamination Nevertheless when using cluster-centric dis-
tance as the environments measurement in clusters one should
scale it with the cluster size eg r200 if not one risks to assign
the same environmental measurement to dierent physical en-
vironments thus mixing age-related trend redshift dependence
with environmental trend The eect is of paramount importance
because gradients in cluster populations are usually important
For instance if one probes a cluster region within a xed ra-
dius eg 1 Mpc one will probe only central regions of large
clusters but outer regions for small clusters which possibly in-
troduces an articial dependence with respect to the cluster size
eg Margoniner et al 2001 Moreover even if challenging at
z  1-2 a robust cluster size estimation is needed to prevent
any smoothing of possible environmental trends when co-adding
data see for instance Loh et al 2008 and the use of the approx-
imate cluster size estimate BGC
Additionally if one uses galaxy clusters to study galaxy evo-
lution the cluster selection function should be as independent as
possible of the studied galaxy population As an example by
selecting preferentially clusters rich in blue galaxies at higher
redshift because they are easier to detect as in the early 80s
Kron 1995 or richer in red galaxies because clusters are de-
tected thanks to the red sequence as in Loh et al 2008 with the
RCS likely introduces a selection eect when estimating the
fraction of blue galaxies Andreon et al 2006 It is preferable
to select clusters by their X-ray emission because at a given
X-ray emission LX or TX clusters rich in blue galaxies are
not favoreddisfavored at a given cluster mass Andreon  Ettori
1999 Furthermore it is well-known that cluster galaxy proper-
ties depend on the cluster richness eg Oemler 1974 Dressler
1980 Dressler et al 1997 Hansen et al 2009 a way to control
this dependence is to select clusters with similar masses
In this paper we aim at disentangling the role of galaxy secu-
lar evolution galaxy mass and environment on galaxy evolution
by analyzing a cluster sample spanning a wide redshift baseline
An observationally economic but still physically ecient proxy
for measuring the star formation activity is galaxy color eg
Butcher  Oemler 1984 Williams et al 2009 Peng et al 2010
We classied galaxies into two broad categories blue or red and
dened the fraction of blue galaxies fblue at a given galaxy mass
M and scaled cluster-centric distance rr200 in the vein of the pi-
oneering work of Butcher  Oemler 1984 In the last decades
numerous works studied fblue in clusters eg De Propris et al
2003 Andreon et al 2006 Loh et al 2008 Haines et al 2009
to name a few but none of them studied the dependence of fblue
on redshift galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance at the same
time Analyzing simultaneously the dependence of fblue on those
three parameters allows one to put strong constraints on the var-
ious processes that are responsible for the cessation of star for-
mation activity quenching
To achieve this we considered the aforementioned remarks
to our best ability We used a sizable X-ray selected cluster sam-
ple 25 clusters with 0  z  1 and the JKCS 041 cluster at z 
22 with well-dened r200 and similar cluster masses thus min-
imizing the correlation between fblue and our cluster selection
function We then estimated fblue as a function of galaxy mass
M and scaled cluster-centric distance rr200 dening bluered
galaxies considering also the stellar evolution of galaxies with
time To lead the analysis we used a reasonable evolutionary
model as a reference exponentially declining star formation his-
tory xed formation redshift and then measured any deviation
from this reference This reference model does not aim to de-
scribe the individual behavior of each galaxy but to cancel out
overall trends such as stellar aging or stellar mass increasing
with time Deviations from this reference model highlight the
evolution and respective role of the quenching in clusters caused
by galaxy mass or to environment
The plan of this paper is as follows We dene in Sect 2 the
cluster sample on which this study relies Sect 3 presents the
data and their analysis including our estimation of fblue Our re-
sults are presented in Sect 4 and are summarized and discussed
in Sect 5 We adopt H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 m  030 and
  070 throughout All magnitudes are in the AB system
corrected for Galactic extinction using Schlegel et al 1998
Masses are computed with a Chabrier 2003 initial mass func-
tion and if not stated otherwise are dened by the mass of the
gas that will eventually be turned into stars ie corresponding to
the integral of the star formation rate
2 Cluster sample
We describe in this section our cluster sample It was assem-
bled from an X-ray selection and clusters with similar masses at
dierent redshifts using the cluster X-ray temperature as mass
proxy The X-ray selection ensures that our cluster sample selec-
tion is unbiased by fblue because the probability of inclusion of
a cluster in the sample is independent of fblue at a given cluster
mass At intermediate redshift we relied on the X-ray selected
cluster sample from the rst ve deg2 of the XMM Large-Scale
Structure survey XMMLSS Pierre et al 2004 At low redshift
we extracted a sample from the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy

the sample to z  225 which corresponds to the faintest z-
band magnitude we work with valid photometry and a secured

312 Star removal
Stars spectroscopically identied by the VVDS cover less than
1 deg2 Therefore we chose the following method to homoge-
neously remove stars in our sample We adopted a conserva-
tive approach for star removal by removing objects qualied as
stars by Coupon et al 2009 according to their color and size
that also have a photometric redshift incompatible with that of
the cluster Indeed when cross-matched with objects that have a
VVDS spectrum 3 of galaxies are wrongly identied as stars
in Coupon et al 2009 Although this is a low percentage we
additionally reduced the false identication rate by re-including
objects classied as stars in Coupon et al 2009 but veried

pz is the photometric redshift probability distribution function
output by Eazy see Sect 315
Stars not identied as such in this phase 12 of our VVDS
stars were removed at a later stage during the photometric red-
shift selection and the background statistical subtraction phase

314 Photometric calibration
To prevent any systematic oset in colors between elds which
can lead to systematic osets in the pz functions we matched
the color-color diagrams of stars falling in dierent elds We
selected a reference eld 022539-041200 and bright stars

315 Redshift probability distributions pz
To remove galaxies that are very probably in front of or behind
the cluster cf 316 we estimated the full photometric redshift
probability distribution function pz for each galaxy using Eazy
Brammer et al 2008 with default settings and an r-band mag-
nitude prior see Appendix B Systematic osets in the photo-
metric calibration between data and models eg Brodwin et al
2006 Brammer et al 2008 were estimated with the same ap-
proach as in Raichoor  Andreon 2012 the found osets are
listed in Table 3 These small shifts comparable with previous
works Ilbert et al 2006 2009 Coupon et al 2009 Barro et al
2011 Raichoor  Andreon 2012 were applied only during the
pz estimation
316 Background removal
We need to account for galaxies along the cluster line of sight
which we generally call background We again took a conserva-
tive approach by only removing galaxies that are very probably
in front of or behind the cluster and by statistically accounting
for the residual background in a second step
First we performed a photometric redshift selection by re-
moving galaxies that are at z  zcl  005  1  zcl or z 
zcl  005  1  zcl at  99  condence This selection has
been calibrated on our spectroscopic VVDS sample and was ac-
complished by keeping objects with
Z zcl0051zcl
pzdz  099
and Z 
zcl0051zcl
pzdz  099
Figure 4 illustrates such a selection criterion for three galaxies
This selection is conservative because it keeps galaxies in
the sample that have a low probability to belong to the cluster
Eqs1 and 2 wrongly remove  1 of galaxies from our spec-
troscopic VVDS sample 131652 To illustrate the eciency of
this background removal we display in Figure 5 the cumulative
pz function for all objects in the background area for four clus-
ters before and after applying the selection described by Eqs1
 2 We observe that this selection removes  50 of back-
ground objects We note that the same amount of objects are
removed for cluster outer regions 1  rr200  2 but less for
cluster core regions rr200  1 because the background con-
tamination is proportionally lower towards the cluster center
We thus observe that Eqs1  2 fulll our conservative
approach criterion it signicantly reduces the sample with re-
jecting a non-signicant part  1 of the galaxies we are in-
terested in Changing the 005 099 values toward a more strin-
gent selection could reduce the contamination in our sample but
at the cost of removing a more signicant part of the galaxies we
are interested in Changing the 005 099 values toward a less
stringent selection would only increase the contamination in our
sample
As a second stage of the background subtraction we aimed
to select independent control elds taken from the very same
A Raichoor  S Andreon Evolution of galaxies in clusters in the last 10 Gyr
control subsample When clusters in a common eld had simi-
lar redshifts always less than four in our sample we associated
them with dierent control subsamples in this eld thus never
attributing the same background twice
In addition this step also subtracts any star that has not been
identied as one based on its colors
32 SDSS
SDSS data were analyzed identically For the SDSSHIFLUGCS
subsample we worked with data in ugriz bands from the SDSS
DR8 Aihara et al 2011 We used the ModelMag for galaxy col-
ors and cModelMag and PsfMag as an approximate total mag-
nitude for galaxies and stars respectively
Our SDSS galaxy sample is selected from the Galaxy view
of the SDSS DR8 to which we applied a cut in magnitude
cModelMag r  19 a spatial cut 10  10 around each
cluster and a criterion to reject saturated stars misclassied as
galaxies FiberMag u  22  05 ModelMag u By matching
this catalog with the spectroscopic informations from the main
galaxy sample petroMag r  178 in SpecPhoto view we
obtained 30000 spectroscopic redshifts zspec  04 which
we used to assess the quality of our background removal
To check that the photometry does not present any system-
atic oset between our elds we used more than 10000 spec-
troscopic stars from the SpecPhoto view located in our elds in
in the same way as for the CFHTLS W1 elds Sect 314 We
found indeed no oset greater than 001 mag for all lters and
all elds
We estimated the pz in in the same way as for the CFHTLS
W1 elds Sect 315 We applied the photometric osets listed
in Table 3
For background removal we selected galaxies as in Sect
316 This criterion removes 20 of the background objects
and wrongly removes 005 of the spectroscopic objects For
each cluster we selected as a control sample objects within a
10  10 area around each cluster excluding objects within
2  r200 around each cluster and within circles 03 radius
around potential clusters at similar redshifts For clusters A2052
and A2063 we dened two independent control subsamples as
described in Sect 316 and using the region within the red solid
line in Figure 3 The resulting control samples are 90 deg2
resp 50 deg2 for the MKW4 A1367 MKW8 A2634 and
A2657 clusters resp the A2052 and A2063 clusters
33 Settingsfortheestimationof fblue
We describe in this section our procedure for consistently mea-
suring the fraction of blue galaxies fblue The procedure de-
scribed here is similar to the one followed in Section 4 of
Raichoor  Andreon 2012 for JKCS 041
For each cluster we considered three radial bins annuli at
distinct cluster-centric radii dened by rr200  05  05 
rr200  1 and 1  rr200  2
331 Probed color
To probe the same rest-frame color at all redshifts as consistently
as possible we worked in a color-magnitude diagram that clos-
est corresponds to the u  r vs r rest-frame thus probing the
4000  break Figure 6 illustrates the lters chosen at each red-
shift of our sample Because our reddest band for the CFHTLS
W1 sample is the z band this implies a drift in the probed rest-

tee homogeneity across the samples Furthermore because we
aimed to stack data for dierent clusters we also needed inde-
pendent data for the background so that we did not overstate the
quality of the control sample
We selected for each CFHTLS W1 eld a control sample in
the same eld in the following way First we removed objects
within 2  r200 around each cluster and within circles 005 ra-
dius around potential clusters at similar redshifts gray areas in

elds ensure that contaminating clusters are taken into account
Then we randomly divided the remaining objects into four sub-
sample to reduce the eect of any potential structure which as-
sembled four independent control subsamples each with a sur-
face of 02 deg2 We randomly associated each cluster to a

frame red band when the redshift is approaching 1 z  077 and
z  105 we are here limited by the data but still improve on
previous works see for instance Loh et al 2008
The top panel of Figure 7 illustrates another possible choice
of lter pairs matching the B V rest-frame color The bottom
panel shows that fblue  estimated as described below  does not
depend on the precise sampling of the lters given that they
bracket the 4000  break Our results are robust regarding the
rest-frame color using the B  V color instead of u  r leads
to similar values of fblue see Figure 7
332 Mass bin dention
For our values of mass M we refer as in previous works to
the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 model 2007 version CB07 here-
after mass and specically to the mass of the gas that will
eventually be turned into stars ie the integral of the star for-
mation rate Andreon et al 2008 Raichoor  Andreon 2012
This mass denition has the advantage to compare galaxies at
each epoch that will end up with the same stellar mass which
means that we include in each mass bin the same galaxies at high
and low redshifts In the color-magnitude diagrams the shape of
these loci of constant mass dier from that which corresponds to
the mass in stars at the redshift of observation Mzobs on the blue
end see Figure 8 the higher the redshift the more fainterbluer
objects are included in our denition For instance a galaxy with
an exponentially declining SFH  expt with   3 Gyr
would have a mass in stars of 305090 of its nal mass in
stars after 081653 Gyr had we chosen the mass in stars
at redshift of observation as a denition of stellar mass such a
galaxy would not be included in our sample at high redshift then
would enter it at a given epoch and drift from one mass bin to
another at an irregular pace thus biasing the result We discuss
in Section 52 the impact of this denition on our results
We used four galaxy mass bins logMM in 992 1033
1033 1073 1073 1113 and 1113  We hereafter
refer to those galaxy mass bins by using the mean value of
each bin using a Schechter 1976 function ie hlogMMi

ting z f orm to 4 or 6 does not change our results and either SSP or
an exponentially declining star-forming  model with 0  SFH 
Gyr  10 The mass values used to dene mass bins correspond
to the mass of an SSP model having at z  0 a V-band absolute
rest-frame magnitude MV of -178-188-198 and -208
The depth of the data limits the sampled mass range for each
cluster we required that the lowest mass cut is brighter than a
signal-to-noise ratio of 5 in the considered color-magnitude dia-
gram This constraint  probing higher masses at higher redshifts
 restricts the mass range probed but ensures that we work on
mass-complete samples and allows a direct comparison of fblue
values at dierent redshift and mass bins
333 Bluered denition
We dene a galaxy as blue if it is bluer than a CB07 model
with   37 Gyr as in Andreon et al 2004 2006 2008

red resp blue if it is redder resp bluer than a model with
  37 Gyr The vertical arrows indicate the redshifts of our
cluster sample
Loh et al 2008 and Raichoor  Andreon 2012 This galaxy
will be bluer by 02 mag in B  V than red-sequence galaxies
at z  0 which would be a blue galaxy by the original deni-
tion of Butcher  Oemler 1984 As a comparison our deni-
tion agrees at z  0 with that used in Peng et al 2010 and e-
ciently splits the red-sequence and the blue cloud of their SDSS
data The rationale behind our choice is to take into account the
stellar evolution of galaxies with time Figure 9 illustrates the
rest-frame u  r color evolution for dierent exponentially de-
clining -SFHs the dierent tracks do not cross each other In
other words if a galaxy follows an exponentially -SFH with
  37 Gyr resp   37 Gyr during its lifetime its color ac-
cording to our denition will remain red resp blue However
we note that this gure assumes that all galaxies have the same
z f orm We will return to this point in Sect 5
In addition we stress that the independence of fblue on the
probed rest-frame color Sect 331 is a consequence of our
choice to dene red and blue galaxies see Fairley et al 2002
for an opposite result when using the red-sequence to split red
and blue galaxies
4 Results
We present in this section the dependence of fblue with galaxy
mass cluster-centric distance and redshift We recall that the
evolution of fblue with redshift traces the fraction of cluster
galaxies that have stopped forming stars under the assumption
of an average exponentially declining star formation history for
cluster galaxies Indeed under our working assumptions and our
denition of bluered galaxies any quenching implies a lowering
of fblue with redshift whereas no quenching implies an fblue con-
stant with redshift Hence our results present the evolution with
redshift of the star formation activity in clusters as a function of
galaxy mass and environment
Before performing a general analysis we start by a simple
analysis that makes partial use of the data Sect 41 and that
therefore does not show trends in a similar clear way Sects 42
 43 Our main result is presented in Section 43 and illustrated
in Figure 13 environmental and mass quenching are separable
environmental quenching does not change with epoch and mass
quenching is a dynamical process ie its evolutionary rate is
mass-dependent
41 Resultsforindividualclusters
For each cluster galaxy mass bin and radial area we com-
puted the blue fraction fblue that accounts for residual back-
ground galaxies ie along the line of sight kept by the criteria of
Eqs1  2 and not belonging to the cluster using our control
samples as dened in Sect 316 and following the Bayesian
methods introduced in Andreon et al 2006 We adopt uniform
priors for the parameters
Figure 10 displays the individual fblue proles for our cluster
sample grouped by redshift and mass bins We dened our red-
shift bins so that each bin spans a period of 2 Gyr 0  z  016
016  z  037 037  z  065 065  z  11 and z  22
We hereafter refer to those redshift bins by using the median
value of our cluster sample in each bin ie hzi  003 031
049 105 and 22 We can already observe some indications of
the trends that we later perceive in stacking analysis
We observe a dierent behavior for dierent galaxy mass
bins at hzi  031 fbluerr200  05 decreases from 04 to
0 with increasing galaxy mass fblue seems to increase with
increasing rr200 for instance at hzi  003 for the less massive
galaxies fblue increases with increasing cluster-centric distance
For the most massive galaxies fbluerr200  05  0 at all
redshifts
However the unavoidable noise  because of the nite and
usually small number of member galaxies per cluster at a given
mass and cluster-centric distance bins  makes it dicult to draw
a general picture
42 Resultsforstackedclusters
We now stacked our sample according to redshift and mass bins
to strengthen the estimated fblue For each panel of Figure 10

fblue for individual clusters as a function of cluster-centric distance rr200 for dierent bins of redshift increasing right-
ward and galaxy mass increasing downward The computed value of fblue already takes into account the mean aging of stars with
increasing redshift by dening the color compared to an exponentially declining SFH model with   37 Gyr Error bars represent
the shortest interval including 68 of the possible posterior values for fblue and are plotted as a dashed line when this interval is
larger than 066 indicating that fblue is not constrained at all Radial cluster-centric bins are indicated by gray lled triangles on the
x-axis and horizontal gray dashed lines indicate the minimum and maximum allowed values for fblue
we computed the mean fblue for all clusters belonging to this
panel multiplying the individual data likelihoods and then us-
ing the Bayes theorem as in the previous section We recall that
the combined data are independent in particular the control sam-
ples The values of fblue are reported in Table 4 and displayed in
Figure 11 as dots with error bars Now the trends are emerging
quite clearly
Regarding the dependence of fblue with cluster-centric dis-
tance our data seem to indicate an increase in fblue with increas-
ing rr200 for most redshift and mass bins The cluster color
prole at given galaxy mass tends to atten with decreasing red-
shift In particular the at prole is achieved at the lowest red-
shift and most massive galaxies For all mass and radial bins our
data suggest a decrease of fblue with decreasing redshift For our
two lowest mass bins this evolutionary trend is strong For the
highest mass bin this decrease is marginal because fblue already
has very low values at high redshifts
Finally we also see a trend when looking at the dependence
of fblue with galaxy mass Indeed for our two lowest redshift
bins where our data span four mass bins we observe a clear
trend at all radial bins at xed redshift and cluster-centric dis-
tance fblue decreases with increasing galaxy mass For instance
fblue decreases
for the innermost radial bin and hzi  003
continuously with increasing galaxy mass from 011004
003 to
001001
001 For hzi  049 though our data only span two mass
bins we observe the same trend Our analysis shows that there
is  in addition to the known mean aging of the stellar popula-
tions  a decrease at all radii in fblue with decreasing redshift

We note that in one panel of Figure 11 hzi  031 and
hlogMMi  1147 our data present an odd behavior for
rr200  1 the value of fblue is quite high and does not reect

redshift dierences inside each panel and the collective use of
the whole dataset allows us to strengthen more the trends even
As detailed below to described the data we also need an
interaction term between galaxy mass and redshift a term that
allows galaxies of dierent mass to evolve at dierent rates We

  log r025  r200 
  logMM  11 
  z  03 
  logMM  11  z  03cid21
where ilogitx  1  expx1 ensures that 0  fblue  1
We adopt uniform priors for the parameters A0    and 
The model t results are plotted in Figure 11 as solid blue
lines and yellow shaded areas 68 condence interval while
the model predictionextrapolation is plotted as dashed blue lines
and yellows hatched areas
The only motivation behind the chosen parametrization is the
adoption of an additive model that ts our data and ensures that
0  fblue  1 The adopted model is the simplest one fullling
those criteria If we do not include the  term the model can-
not t data in the redshift bins hzi  031 for galaxies within
our two lowest mass bins see cyan vertically hatched areas in
Figure 11 and to a lesser extent in the panel hzi  049 and
hlogMMi  1094 In a similar manner if we replace the
term crossing M and z by a term crossing r and z or r and M the
model fails in tting the data Furthermore we note that adding
a term crossing r and z in addition to our  term does not im-
prove the quality of the t The fblue evolution with redshift is
therefore more sensitive to the galaxy mass than to its cluster-
centric distance
The posterior probabilities for the model parameters are plot-
ted in Figure 12 which shows how our knowledge about the
parameters changes from before prior blue line to after poste-
rior blackred lines the data In short the posterior distribution
of all parameters is much more concentrated than the prior ie
data are highly informative about these parameters and conclu-
sions on these parameters do not depend on the adopted prior

our model is constrained at z  1 only by the JKCS 041 cluster
if we repeat the t without the JKCS 041 data the model ap-
pears to be entirely unconstrained in the hlogMMi  1147

To better visualize the dependence of fblue on those three pa-
rameters M rr200 and z we display in Figure 13 the vari-
ations of fblue on two of them when xing the third one The
information data and model tpredictions is exactly the same
as in Figure 11 only presented dierently We recall that our
model is only constrained where there are some data shaded
areas and that the t was performed on the individual 225 val-
ues of fblue This gure illustrates on the one hand that at xed
cluster-centric distance fblue evolves at dierent paces for dier-
ent galaxy stellar masses panels a and b captured by the  term
in our model On the other hand we can see in panel c that the
model evolution of fblue with z at xed galaxy mass has a similar
shape for our values of rr200 Lastly panel d summarizes the ra-
dial proles of fblue at a xed redshift for dierent galaxy mass

Adopting a mass threshold corresponding to the original
Butcher  Oemler 1984 one logMM  1053 we ob-
serve no evolution of fblue with redshift for our data z  043
see Figure 14 However when extrapolating the model to z 
105 we observe an increase in fblue in broad agreement with the
measurement done by Andreon et al 2008 for the RzCS 052
cluster
That almost no evolution is found at z  043 whereas we
do detect one for hlogMMi  1054 nicely illustrates the
benet of splitting our sample into ne galaxy mass bins
5 Discussion and conclusion
Our aim was to put constraints on the dierent processes respon-
sible for the cessation of star formation activity quenching in
clusters through a careful study of the dependence of the fraction

line We have built a cluster sample consisting of seven clusters
002  zspec  004 from the HIFLUGCS survey eighteen
clusters 014  zspec  105 from the XMMLSS survey and
JKCS 041 z  22 Because the HIFLUGCS and XMMLSS
surveys are X-ray selected our cluster sample is unbiased re-
garding the fraction of blue galaxies fblue at a given cluster mass
in addition our clusters were chosen to have similar masses For
dierent galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance bins we care-
fully estimated fblue for each cluster and tted the dependence of
fblue with redshift galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance We
did not attempt to invert the noisy data because of the degeneracy
between z f orm age and metallicity but instead we modied the
model until it tted the data The reference model has an expo-
nentially declinining SFH and hence an evolving mass if stars
are formed mass in stars cannot be xed Deviations from this
reference model highlight the evolution and respective role of
the quenching in clusters due to galaxy mass or to environment
Our main result is displayed in Figures 11 and 13 We re-
call that in those gures we have already taken into account that
galaxies are on average younger at higher redshifts by using an
exponentially declining -model to dene whether a galaxy is
red or blue This means that any measured evolution of fblue with
redshift reects a phenomenon in addition to the younger mean
age of the Universe and the secular increase in the star formation
rate We also recall that our model tting was performed on the
225 individual measurements of fblue Moreover our denition
of galaxy mass ensures that for each mass bin the selected high-
redshift galaxies are those that would end up in the low-redshift
galaxies selection
We are therefore able to disentangle for the rst time the role
of secular evolution galaxy mass and cluster-centric distance
on galaxy evolution in clusters We found that fblue decreases
with decreasing redshift z with decreasing cluster-centric dis-
tance rr200 and with increasing galaxy mass M This means
that the processes responsible for the cessation of star formation
in clusters are eective at all epochs z  22 and more eec-
tive in denser environments and for more massive galaxies Our
simple modeling of the data shows that the dependence of fblue
on galaxy mass evolves with redshift while this is not the case
for the dependence of fblue on cluster-centric distance the inten-
sity of mass quenching evolves with redshift at dierent paces
for dierent galaxy masses whereas the environmental quench-
ing does not evolve with redshift Additionally our data did not
need any correlation between galaxy mass and cluster-centric
distance in the model tting which means that mass quenching
and environmental quenching are separable
51 Remarkontakingintoaccountsecularevolutionwhen
estimating fblue
We illustrate in this section the advantage of taking into account
secular evolution when estimating fblue using a non-evolving
color threshold eg Presotto et al 2012 will result in using a

MV in Butcher  Oemler 1984 Symbols are as in Figures 10 and 11 We add a new panel at z  105 for model prediction where
we overplot the measured values of fblue for the RzCS 052 cluster in Andreon et al 2008
redder color to split blue and red galaxies hence in increasing
As a test we repeated our analysis with a non-evolving
mass-dependent denition of bluered galaxy For low redshifts
z  05 this leads to results marginally dierent from ours
because the colors used in the two methods to split blue and
red galaxies do not dier signicantly However for higher
redshifts we do observe a notable dierence between the two
methods because the dierence between the two denitions of
bluered galaxies will increase with increasing redshift For in-
stance using a non-evolving color threshold leads to larger blue
fractions at z  1 02  fblue  06 for stacked data Since
fblue depends on rr200 a non-evolving color threshold also tilts
the fblue prole Overall the results using a non-evolving color
threshold are much harder to interpret because there is an ad-
ditional eect that depends on the redshift and potentially the
radial bins under inspection
52 Remarkonusingevolvedmassdenition
We remark that using the mass in stars at the redshift of obser-
vation Mzobs as a mass denition does not appreciably change
our conclusions the estimated values of fblue are slightly lower
but the trivariate dependence of fblue on redshift galaxy mass
and cluster-centric distance remains similar the    and 
parameters vary by less than 1
Indeed as illustrated in Figure 8 lines of constant mass at the
redshift of observation in the color-magnitude diagrams are sim-
ilar to those used in the study but for blue colors For a consid-
ered mass bin using Mzobs instead of M will remove galaxies in
the light-gray shaded area but add those in the dark-gray shaded
area Because of the mass function shape the former will on av-
erage be slightly more numerous than the latter the net eect
will be to slightly decrease the number of blue galaxies hence
53 Dependenceof fblue on M andz
The data and their t point out two results
 The average SFH is more complex than exponentially declin-
ing SFHs as quantied by the  and  terms Indeed if clus-
ter galaxies had on average exponentially declining SFHs
we should not observe any change of the fblue radial pro-
le with redshift at xed galaxy mass Low-mass galaxies
may have a briey enhanced SFH because of starbust hence
temporarily a color bluer than an SFH   37 Gyr model
after which their color turns redder than an SFH   37
Gyr model For our lowest mass bin this mechanism would
still be at work at z  037 We also considered the case of
a later z f orm for low-mass galaxies We experimented with
some possible choices without being able to remove the ob-
served evolution of fblue with redshift although our tests are
not exhaustive and we are reaching the limit of the data
 There is a dierential evolution of fblue with the galaxy mass
ie mass quenching is a dynamical process Galaxies with
smaller masses evolve later for instance at z  037 fblue
for galaxies in our lowest mass bin still evolve signicantly
which is not the case for fblue for more massive galaxies
Furthermore less massive galaxies seem to evolve on a
longer timescale than more massive galaxies In the 3 Gyr be-
tween our two lowest redshift bins fblue changes by 04 for
low-mass galaxies In less time 2 Gyr fblue should change by
twice as much at z  2 for high-mass galaxies
54 Dependenceof fblue onrr200
We now turn to the analysis of the dependence of fblue with
cluster-centric distance rr200 For all galaxy stellar mass and
redshift bins fblue decreases with decreasing rr200 ie environ-
mental quenching is eective at all redshifts and stellar masses
Figure 11 This eect is conspicuous on lower mass galaxies
as fblue is very low for massive galaxies whatever the cluster-
centric distance one should observe a signicant number of
clusters at z  1-2 to see this eect on massive galaxies
A Raichoor  S Andreon Evolution of galaxies in clusters in the last 10 Gyr
Previous works clearly established this dependence on rr200 for
mass-selected samples eg Andreon et al 2008 Haines et al
2009 however our study shows for the rst time that this de-
pendence holds for dierent galaxy mass bins In addition the
model tting our data implies that the mass and environmental
quenchings are fully separable because no crossed term between
M and rr200 is required
Additionally we found that our data do not require any evo-
lution of this dependence with redshift our simple model re-
quires only a crossed term between M and z none between rr200
and z This can be interpreted that either this evolution with z of
the environmental quenching is not present or that is of second
order when compared to the evolution with z of the mass quench-
ing We recall that our cluster sample consists of clusters having
similar temperatures at all redshifts while a self-similarly evolv-
ing cluster model Kaiser 1986 suggests a mild increase with
redshift at 0  z  1 Nevertheless current studies tend to show
that fblue estimated in the virial radius is independent of cluster
mass at least in the local Universe eg De Propris et al 2004
Goto 2005
Finally we would like to emphasize the importance of the
backsplash population on the fblue radial prole and its evolu-
tion with redshift galaxies as far away as two virial radii may
have been within the main body of the cluster in the past eg
Balogh et al 2000 Gill et al 2005 Mahajan et al 2011
55 Conclusion
Our study extends the relationship between galaxy mass star
formation rate and environment at z  1 explored by Peng et al
2010 to intermediate-mass cluster environments As those au-
thors we found that the cessation of star formation quench-
ing due to environment and galaxy mass are separable we
needed no crossed term between rr200 and M to t our data
that environmental quenching does not change with epoch we
needed no crossed term between rr200 and z to t our data
and that mass quenching is a dynamical process we did need a
crossed term between M and z to t our data The close agree-
ment between the two studies is likely a consequence of the com-
mon choices adopted for the two analyses disentangling galaxy
mass and environment plus taking into account the secular aging
of stars with decreasing redshift as described by Andreon et al
2006 However in addition to paying special attention to the
statistical aspect of the analysis which allowed us to provide
good condence intervals on our measurements our study im-
plemented a ner control on galaxy mass by considering the
mass evolved at z  0 and on environmental estimation us-
ing rr200 is less subject to biases than a density eld based on
rest-frame B-band selection
Muzzin et al 2012 investigating a cluster sample at z  1
with spectroscopic data made a similar analysis studying the
role of galaxy mass and environment but not secular evolution
on star formation The availability of spectroscopic data allows
estimating the star formation rate and thus a thorough analysis
of this problem Regarding the fraction of star-forming galax-
ies these authors also concluded that mass and environmental
quenching are separable Our work extends this study by includ-
ing the redshift dependence in the analysis by a better character-
ization r200 of cluster properties and by using a cluster sample
that is not selected by a galaxy property under study color
Our study extends the downsizing-like scenario to cluster
environment and all galaxies which was already established
for galaxies with specic properties in the eld eg emis-
sion line Cowie et al 1996 spheroidal Treu et al 2005 pas-
sive Peng et al 2010 According to this scenario the proper-
ties of the most massive galaxies are established in the very
early Universe z  1 while less massive galaxies continue
to evolve at redshifts 0  z  1 We stress that our down-
sizing-like scenario concerns all galaxies regardless of their
morphology or color The results of Andreon et al 2008 and
Raichoor  Andreon 2012 taken as a whole point to a similar
conclusion though for smaller cluster samples
Our work is the rst to study the dependence of fblue in clus-
ters on galaxy mass redshift and cluster-centric distance at the
same time with a cluster sample whose properties are well-
controlled In particular it clearly demonstrates the need to use
galaxy mass as a parameter to better understand the behavior of
fblue This approach is now possible with the wealth of available

Appendix A r200 estimation
Pacaud et al 2007
For clusters with TX measurements
Hudson et al 2010 r200
is determined using the mass-
temperature relation of Finoguenov et al 2001 which has been
shown to give robust results for clusters with TX  4 keV
Willis et al 2005
r500 Mpc 
0391  T 063
Hz70
where Hz  H0pm1  z3   describes the redshift
evolution of the Hubble parameter in the assumed cosmological
model Then we use r200  r5000661 corresponding to a
Navarro et al 1997 prole with a halo concentration parame-
ter c  5
For clusters with no TX measurements XLSSC 007
XLSSC 014 and XLSSC 016 we estimate r200 from the clus-
ter velocity dispersion v from Willis et al 2005 following
the formula
r200 Mpc 
3  vkms1
10  Hz
 085
This equation is similar to the classical equation for a spher-
ical collapse model eg Carlberg et al 1997 but for the
multiplicative coecient 085 This coecient comes from a
calibration we perform with a compilation of clusters having TX
and v measurements see for instance Proctor et al 2011 for a
similar systematic dierence EqA2 ensures that there is no
bias between our r200 estimated with TX or v see Figure A1
Appendix B r-band prior for photometric redshifts
Because Eazy has been developed for high-z studies the r-band
prior does not include magnitudes brighter than 20 In our SDSS
sample we deal with galaxies as bright as r  12 We built the
prior probabilities pzm0 for 135  r  18 as follows For each
interval of 05 mag we retrieved 10000 spectroscopic galaxies
from the SpecPhoto view from the SDSS DR8 database and
tted the redshift distribution with a function
pzm0  z  exp zz0
Fig A1 Comparison of r200 estimated with EqsA1  A2
the test sample is made of 10 clusters from the XMMLSS sur-
vey Willis et al 2005 Andreon et al 2006 Pacaud et al 2007
28 clusters from the CAIRNS survey Rines  Diaferio 2006
and 15 clusters from the CNOC1Muzzin et al 2007 and spans
0003  zspec  084 05  TXkeV  103 and 232  v km
s1  1354 There is no bias between the r200 estimated from
TX and from v The horizontal resp vertical arrows indicate
the r200 estimated from TX resp v for our cluster sample
Fig B1 z0 and  parameters used for building r-band prior with
EqB1
as in Brammer et al 2008 At 135  r and 18  r  20 we
visually extrapolated z0 and  cf Figure B1 because either
there are not enough galaxies or those present in the SDSS are a
biased sample eg LRGs QSOs etc
