I discuss three different topics in Galactic chemical evolution the puzzling absence of any ob-
servational signature of secondary elements  the building of the Galactic halo in the framework
of hierarchical galaxy formation as evidenced from its metallicity distribution  and the poten-
tially important role that radial migration may play in the evolution of galactic disks according
to recent studies

Galactic Chemical Evolution

1 The elusive secondary elements
In the eld of galactic chemical evolution primary elements are those produced from the ini-
tial essentially primordial H and He entering a star at its formation while secondary elements
are those formed from all other elements metals entering the star Thus the yields of primary
elements are independent of the stellar metallicity while those of secondaries increase with it As a
result the secondaryprimary ratio is expected to increase linearly with metallicity Typical exam-
ples of primaries are the a nuclides 12C 16O 20Ne etc as well as 56Fe while it was traditionally
thought that 14N produced from initial C and O through the CNO cycle in H-burning or the s-
elements produced by n-captures on seed Fe nuclei are typical secondaries It turns out however
that neither those elements nor any other up to now shows the expected typical behaviour of
secondaries In other terms the concept of secondary element remains only theoretical up to now
with no observational substantiation In some cases we think that we understand the relevant
observations but in others the situation is still unclear
11 The quest for primary Nitrogen
The behaviour of N as primary ie NFe0 was known for sometime but it was recently
conrmed from VLT mesurements Spite et al 2005 down to the realm of very low metallicities
FeH-3 see Fig 1 middle right For a long time the only known source of primary N was
Hot Bottom Burning HBB in massive AGB stars Such stars typical mass M 8 M have
lifetimes 108 yr considerably longer than those of typical SNII progenitors 20 M stars living
for 107 yr thus it is improbable albeit not impossible1 that that they contributed to the earliest
enrichment of the Galaxy with N On the other hand massive stars were thought to produce N only
as secondary from the initial CNO and not to be at the origin of the observed behaviour
Rotationally induced mixing in massive stars changed the situation considerably N is now
produced by H-burning of C and O produced inside the star As in the case of HBB in massive
AGBs N is produced after mixing of protons in He-rich zones where 12C originates from the 3-a
reaction ie N is produced as primary it is subsequently ejected to the ISM mostly by the winds
of those massive stars Stellar models rotating at 300 kms typical velocity for solar metallicity
stars at all metallicities did not provide enough primary N at low metallicities to explain the
data Prantzos 2003a and Fig 1 middle right Assuming that low metallicity massive stars were
rotating faster than their high-metallicity present-day counterparts at 800 kms leads to a large
production of primary N even at low Z and allows one to explain the data eg Chiappini et al
2006 and Fig 1 middle right Thus there appears to be a natural solution to the problem of
early primary N which may impact on other isotopes as well eg 13C produced in a similar
way Even more important it may also impact on the next item in the list namely the evolution of
beryllium
12 The quest for primary Be
Observations of halo stars in the 90s revealed a linear relationship between BeH and FeH
Gilmore et al 1991 Ryan et al 1992 as well as between BH and FeH Duncan et al 1992
1The timescales of the early Galactic evolution are not constrained there is no age-metallicity relation and the
contribution of AGBs to chemical enrichment even as early as FeH3 cannot be absolutely excluded

Figure 1 Left Evolution of C N and O vs FeH Solid purple curves correspond to yields of fast ro-
tating stars at low metallicity and reproduce the observed early behaviour of N Evolutionary timescales
corresponding to the metallicity scale and masses of stars dying in those timescales appear in the lower
panelRight Observations of BeH and BeFe vs FeH the two dotted lines correspond to primary and
secondary behaviour respectively
That was unexpected since Be and B were thought to be produced as secondaries by spallation
of the increasingly abundant CNO nuclei of the ISM during the propagation of protons and aplhas
of Galactic Cosmic rays GCR The only way to produce primary Be is by assuming that it is
produced by the fragmentation of the CNO nuclei of GCR as they hit the p and a of the ISM and
that GCR have always the same CNO content Duncan et al 1992 other efforts to enhance the
early production of Be by eg invoking a better connement - and thus higher uxes - of GCR in
the early Galaxy Prantzos et al 1993 only partially succeeded2 The reason was clearly revealed
by the energetics argument put forward by Ramaty et al 1997 if SN are the main source of
GCR energy there is a limit to the amount of light elements produced per SN which depends on
GCR and ISM composition If the metal content of both ISM and GCR is low there is simply
not enough energy in GCR to keep the Be yields constant The only possibility to have constant
LiBeB yields is by assuming that the reverse component of GCR fast CNO nuclei is primary ie
that GCR have a constant metallicity Fig 2 in Prantzos 2010 This has profound implications
for our understanding of the GCR origin It should be noted that before those observations no one
would have the idea to ask what was the GCR composition in the early Galaxy
For quite some time it was thought that GCR originate from the average ISM where they
are accelerated by the forward shocks of SN explosions this can only produce secondary Be A
constant abundance of C and O in GCR can naturally be understood if SN accelerate their own
2The observed primary evolution of B can be explained by assuming n -induced production of its major isotope 11B
in core collapse SN Olive et al 1994

ejecta trough their reverse schock Ramaty et al 1997 However the absence of unstable 59Ni
decaying through e capture within 105 yr from observed GCR suggests that acceleration occurs
105 yr after the explosion Wiedenbeck et al 1999 when SN ejecta are presumably already
diluted in the ISM
Higdon et al 1998 suggested that GCR are accelerated out of superbubbles SB material
enriched by the ejecta of many SN as to have a large and constant metallicity In this scenario it is
the forward shocks of SN that accelerate material ejected from other previously exploded SN see
Binns et al 2005 Rauch et al 2009 The SB scenario suffers from several drawbacks Prantzos
2010 which however may not be lethal Still it is hard to imagine that SB have always the
same average metallicity especially during the early Galaxy evolution where metals were easily
expelled out of the shallow potential wells of the small sub-units forming the Galactic halo
A different explanation for the origin of GCR is proposed in Prantzos 2010 He notices
that rotating massive stars display substantial mass loss down at very low or even zero metallic-
ities see previous section Assuming that GCR are accelerated when the forward shocks of SN
propagate into the previously ejected envelopes of rotating massive stars partially mixed with the
surrounding ISM one may then calculate the evolution of the ISM and GCR composition Fig 2
left It is found that the resulting Be evolution nicely ts the data Fig 2 right it is the rst time
that such a calculation is performed not by assuming a given GCR composition but by calculating
it in a hopefully realistic way

Figure 3 Evolution of Sr Y and Zr in the Galaxy halo and solar neighborhood observations vs a model
involving s-process from low and intermediate mass stars solid curves and a putative n-process dashed
curves From Travaglio et al 2004
13 The early appearance of s-elements
The products of slow n-capture s-process were traditionally thought to behave as secon-
daries However various theoretical arguments suggest that this cannot be true in most cases and
current uncertainties prevent from making sound theoretical predictions for the behaviour of those
elements
1 Solar system s-elements have a primary contribution fr  YrYr  Ys where Ys and Yr
are the corresponding yields from the r-process thus for an s-element X a oor in the XFe
ratio is expected below some metallicity Z Truran 1981 But the evolution of fr with Z is poorly
determined because of the unknown evolution of Ys while Yr is expected to evolve roughly as the
oxygen yield YO at least at late times
2 YsZ depends on
i the behaviour of the neutron economy trio sources - poisons -
seed nuclei with metallicity Prantzos et al 1990 for instance the behaviour of the n-source
13Ca n is different from the one of 22Nea n and ii the mass range of the s-element sources
stars with M 15-3 M with lifetimes from a few 108 to a few 109 yr for the main s-component
but massive stars for the weak s-component since the yields of individual stars yMZ are
unknown the behaviour of the global yield YsZ averaged over the IMF is unknown also
In the case of heavy s-elements like Ba the observed behaviour of eg the BaEu ratio Eu
being an almost pure r-element can be explained as resulting from a pure r- contribution below
FeH-15 where BaEuconst-06 and a stronger but not monotonically increasing con-
tribution from the s-process in intermediate mass stars above that value see Travaglio et al 1999
Galactic Chemical Evolution
Nikos Prantzos
However the situation appears much more difcult in the case of the light s-elements Sr Y and
Zr which behave exactly as Fe ie the XFe ratio is constant down to the lowest metallicities
Since the r- contribution to the solar system abundances of those elements is small Travaglio et
al 2004 suggested the operation of an unknown neutron capture process called n-process of
primary nature in massive stars at low metallicities
One might think that a natural site for that process may be 22Nea n in core He-burning
in massive rotating stars indeed as stressed in Sec 11 primary 14N is produced in those stars
and the amount remaining in the He-burning -zones is turned mostly into primary22Ne early in
He-burning However since both the neutron source 22Ne and the main neutron poisons 25Mg
and 22Ne are primary the s-process in the Sr-Zr region turns out to be secondary scaling with the
Fe seed abundance as shown in Pignatari et al 2008 with a 25 M model of rotating star at
metallicities FeH-3 and -4 respectively Thus the observed primary behaviour of Sr Y and Zr
at low metallicity remains unexplained at present
2 The MW halo in cosmological context
The metallicity distribution number of stars per unit metallicity interval of a galaxian system
gives valuable information about its history and in particular the occurence of gaseous ows in-
fall outow The regular shape of the metallicity distribution of the Milky Way MW halo can
readily be explained by the simple model of galactic chemical evolution GCE with outow as
suggested by Hartwick 1976 However that explanation lies within the framework of the mono-
lithic collapse scenario for the formation of the MW Eggen Lynden-Bell and Sandage 1962
Several attempts to account for the metallicity distribution of the MW halo in the modern frame-
work hierarchical merging of smaller components hereafter sub-haloes were undertaken in recent
years through numerical simulations Bekki and Chiba 2001 Salvadori et al 2007 Independently
of their success or failure in reproducing the observations such models provide little or no physical
insight into the physical processes that shaped the metallicity distribution of the MW halo Why
is its metallicity distribution so well described by the simple model with outow which refers to
a single system And what determines the peak of the metallicity distribution at FeH16
which is successfully interpreted in the simple model by a single parameter the outow rate 
Here we present an attempt to built the halo metallicity distribution analytically Prantzos 2008a
in the framework of the hierarchical merging paradigm
21 The halo metallicity distribution and the simple model
The halo metallicity distribution is nicely described by the simple model of GCE in which
the metallicity Z is given as a function of the gas fraction m as Z  p ln1m   Z0 where Z0
is the initial metallicity of the system and p is the yield metallicities and yield are expressed in
units of the solar metallicity Z If the system evolves at a constant mass closed box the yield
is called the true yield otherwise ie in case of mass loss or gain it is called the effective yield

star formation rate the corresponding effective yields in Z appear on top right of each panel Dashed

dotted line represents the effective yield of the sub-haloes that formed the MW halo according to this work
ie with no contribution from SNIa see Sec 32 The MW halo with average metallicity FeH16 and
estimated mass 4x108 M falls below both curves
where Z1 is the nal metallicity of the system and n1 the total number of stars having metallicities

22 The halo DMD and hierarchical merging
Assuming that the MW halo was formed by the merging of smaller units sub-haloes one
has to know a the DMD of each sub-halo and b the number distribution of the sub-haloes dNdM
Prantzos 2008a assumed that the DMD of each sub-halo had a DMD described by the simple
model with an appropriate effective yield This assumption is based on recent observations of the
dwarf spheroidal dSph satellites of the Milky Way3 The DMDs of four nearby dSphs Helmi
3It is true that the dSphs that we see today cannot be the components of the MW halo because of their observed
abundance patterns eg Shetrone Ct and Sargent 2001 Venn et al 2004 their a Fe ratios are typically smaller than
the aFe04const ratio of halo stars This implies that they evolved on longer timescales than the Galactic halo
allowing SNIa to enrich their ISM with Fe-peak nuclei and thus to lower the a Fe ratio by a factor of 2-3 as evidenced
from the OFe0 ratio in their highest metallicity stars

cated in the middle panel as well as the sum over all haloes solid upper curves in both panels compared to
observations Dotted curves in top and middle panels indicate the results of the simple model with outow
same as in Fig 1 Because of their large number small sub-haloes with low effective yields contribute the
largest fraction of the lowest metallicity stars while large haloes contribute most of the high metallicity stars

et al 2006 are displayed as histograms in Fig 4 left where they are compared to the simple
model with appropriate effective yields solid curves The effective yield in each case was simply
assumed to equal the peak metallicity Eq 11
It can be seen that the overall shape of the
DMDs is quite well tted by the simple models This is important since i it strongly suggests
that all DMDs of small galaxian systems can be described by the simple model and ii it allows
to determine effective yields by simply taking the peak metallicity of each DMD Observations
suggest that the effective yield is a monotonically increasing function of the galaxys stellar mass
M Fig 4 right In the case of the progenitor systems of the MW halo however the effective yield
must have been lower since SNIa had not time to contribute as evidenced by the high a Fe04
ratios of halo stars by a factor of about 2-3 We assume then that the effective yield of the MW
halo components pM accreted satellites or sub-haloes is given in Z by the thick dotted curve

D eg Giocoli et al 2008 In our case we are interested in the mass function of

The result appears in Fig 5 right with top panel in linear and middle panel in logarithmic scales
respectively It can be seen that it ts the observed DMDs at least as well as the simple model
 la Hartwick In summary under the assumptions made here the bulk of the DMD of the MW
halo results naturally as the sum of the DMDs of the component sub-haloes and can be understood
analytically
It should be noted that all the ingredients of the analytical model are taken from
observations of local satellite galaxies except for the adopted mass function of the sub-haloes
which results from analytical theory of structure formation plus a small modication to account
for the role of outows
Besides the shape of the bulk of the halo DMD its low metallicity tail offers valuable clues as
to the early period of halo formation and metal enrichment Recent analysis of the HES data for
1700 giant stars Schrck et al 2009 and for 700 turn-off stars Li et al 2010 Fig 6 seem to
suggest a sharp decline in star numbers below FeH35 which could be interpreted as evidence
for halo formation from gas pre-enriched to that value eg Salvadori et al 2007 However the
situation may be more complex dual halo structure with unknown relative contributions from
an inner metal-rich and an outer metal-poor halo Carollo et al 2007 and small number statistics
at such low metallicities prevent any denitive conclusions yet Fortcoming studies SEGUE-2
APOGEE LAMOST are expected to clarify the situation in that metallicity range

3 Radial mixing in the Milky way disk
In classical studies of GCE it is explicitly assumed that the system may be open as far as its
gas is concerned allowing for eg infall outow or radial inows but it is closed regarding its
stars once formed they remain in the system and their properties especially those of long-lived
ones metallicity distribution age-metallicity relation can help us to reconstruct the history of the
system This paradigm started changing in recent years making the interpretation of stellar data
more difcult requiring combined studies of chemistry and kinematics but also more enriching
opening new perspectives
The idea that stars in a galactic disk may diffuse to large distances along the radial direction ie
to distances larger than allowed by their epicyclic motions was proposed by Wielen et al 1996
They suggested that some of the peculiar chemical properties of the Sun may be explained by the
assumption that it was born in the inner Galaxy ie in a high metallicity region in view of the
galactic metallicity gradient and subsequently migrated outwards They treated the hypothetical
radial migration phenomenologically acknowledging that the basic mechanism for the gravitational
perturbations of stellar orbits is not understood
Sellwood and Binney 2002 herefter SB02 convincingly argued that stars can migrate over
large radial distances due to continuous resonant interactions with transient spiral density waves at
co-rotation Such a migration alters the specic angular momentum of individual stars but affects
very little the overall distribution of angular momentum and thus does not induce important radial
heating of the disk Because high-metallicity stars from the inner more metallic and older and the
outer less metallic and younger disc are brought in the solar neighborhood SB02 showed with
a simple toy model that considerable scatter may result in the local age-metallicity relation not
unlike the one observed by Edvardsson et al 1993 see also Prantzos 2008b
Another obvious implication of the radial migration model of SB02 concerns the attening of
the stellar metallicity gradient in the galactic disk That issue was quantitatively explored in Lepine
et al 2003 who considered however the corotation at a xed radius contrary to SB02 As
a result the gravitational interaction bassically removes stars from the local disk kicking them
inwards and outwards The abundance prole assumed to be initially exponential is little affected
in the inner Galaxy but some attening is obtained in the 8-10 kpc region The authors claim that
such a attening is indeed observed using data of planetary nebulae by Maciel and Quireza 1996
but modern surveys do not nd it
On the basis of kinematics and abundance observations of a large sample of local stars Hay-
wood 2008 argues that most of the metal rich stars in the solar neighborhood originate from
the inner disk and most of the metal poor ones from the outer disk and suggests that the local
disk started its evolution with a considerably high metallicity of FeH-02 However such a
large pre-enrichment of the thin disk is difcult to accept because no other local component of
the Galaxy is massive enough to enrich to such a high level the massive thin disk Independently
however of his far-reaching conclusions Haywood 2008 presents convincing arguments that the
local stellar population shows evidence for substantial contamination with stars from other Galactic
regions This idea has profound implications for galactic chemical evolution studies since it im-
plies that observations of a stellar population in a given region cannot be used to derive the history
of that region the history of adjacent and even remote regions has to be considered as well

and Maciel 1996 and Holmberg et al 2007 respectively The dashed histogram is the MDF if stars are
assumed to remain in situ from Roskar et al 2008
Building on the ideas of SB02 Schoenrich and Binney 2009 SB09 presented a full scale
semi-analytic model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way disk including several ingredi-
ents gaseous infall radial inow of gas along the disk churning of stars and cold but not hot
gas and blurring of stars4 The model has a rather large number of parameters and assumptions
and nds excellent agreement with each and every observable in the solar neighborhood including
shape and scatter in age-metallicity relation G-dwarf metallicity distribution kinematics of thin
and thick disk etc
In particular the properties of the thick disk are naturally found in this
model as a result of secular evolution with no need to invoke galactic mergers
Numerical N-body  SPH simulations of Roskar et al
2008 have already shown that
extensive radial mixing may occur in disk galaxies due to the action of spiral arms and that it
may help explaining observed properties of the solar neighborhood Fig 7 Recent simulations
of Loebman et al 2010 lend support to the idea of thick disk resulting from secular evolution
albeit with substantial differences on some observables with respect to SB09 the local thick disk
results from stars migrated from the inner disk retaining their high vertical velocity dispersions
but found in the lower gravitational potential of the solar neighborhood Finally Minchev and
Famaey 2010 nd that the galactic bar in conjunction with the spiral arm potential may play an
efcient role in accelerating radial migration of stars
Although it is rather early to say whether the global picture of the Milky Way evolution in-
volving an inside-out disk formation will change drastically it is clear that those works open new
and promising perspectives in GCE studies
4In SB terminology churning implies change of guiding-centre radii while blurring means steady increase of the
oscillation amplitude around the guiding-centre boths effects being due to interaction with spiral arm potential
