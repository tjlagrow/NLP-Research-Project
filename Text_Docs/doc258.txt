Cosmic evolution of gas content and accretion
Francoise Combes
Abstract In the present universe the gas is a minor component of giant galaxies and
its dominant phase is atomic HI During galaxy evolution in cosmic times models
predict that gas fractions were much higher in galaxies and gas phases could be
more balanced between molecular H2 and atomic HI This gaseous evolution
is certainly a key factor to explain the cosmic evolution of the star formation rate
density Star formation efciency might also vary with redshift and the relative
importance of these factors is not yet well known Our current knowledge of cosmic
evolution of gas from molecular observations at high-z is reviewed and confronted
to simulations
1 Introduction
The abundance of gas observable in galaxies today can be expressed with dimen-
sionless numbers normalised with the critical density of the universe While stars in
galaxies account for W   3 103 eg Fukugita et al 1998 the HI gas contributes
by W HI  35 104 Zwaan et al 2005 and the molecular gas by W H2  12 104
Young et al 1995 Sauty et al 2003 Keres et al 2003 Saintonge et al 2011
Theoretical considerations and semi-analytical models predict that the molecular-
to-atomic gas ratio decreases regularly with cosmic time in galaxies Obreschkow
 Rawlings 2009 Obreschkow et al 2009 The phase transition to molecular hy-
drogen can be formulated in terms of pressure Blitz  Rosolowsky 2006 and the
surface density and consequently the pressure is higher in high-z galaxies The mod-
elisation leads to a dependency of H2HI varying as 1z16 This is essentially due
to the expectation that the size of galaxies is growing as 1z1 with cosmic time
The evolution with z of W HI in galaxies is not yet known from emission but
can be derived from the damped Lyman-a absorption in front of quasars since
these systems are thought to correspond to galaxies Albeit with large error bars
the abundance of HI appears about constant from z4 to z0 Zwaan et al 2005 It
is however expected to experience a strongly varying phase at higher z when cold
gas settles in galaxies through accretion and cooling mergers etc At these early

epochs molecules might have difculties to form since metals and dust are building
up slowly but the exact processes are not yet well known
What is better known is the cosmic evolution of star formation rate density from
UV to far-infrared light and its decrease by a factor 20 since z2 eg Hopkins 
Beacom 2006 Bouwens et al 2011 How does this SFR evolution relate to the cos-
mic cold gas evolution Is it linked to HI or H2 density orand to the star formation
efciency SFE
2 High-z molecular observations
Since about 20 years now molecular gas is observed in high redshift galaxies Due
to the lack of sensitivity mostly lensed galaxies were rst discovered cf the review
by Solomon  vanden Bout 2005 More and more normal objects on the main
sequence of star forming galaxies are observed now and this will increase consid-
erably with ALMA The detection of CO lines at high redshift is made easier by
the existence of the rotational ladder where the ux of the higher transitions can be
much higher than the fundamental line This is not the sase of the HI gas and the
only 21cm line which will have to wait SKA to be detectable at high redshift
21 Starbursts and ULIRGs
Until very recently only very luminous galaxies in the far-infrared LIRGs and
ULIRGs were detected in the CO lines at high redshift due to limited sensitivity
In the local universe it is now well established that ULIRGs are starbursts triggered
by galaxy interactions and mergers eg Solomon et al 1997 At high redshift the
global star formation rate is increasing rapidly and even ULIRG are not all star-
bursts It is thought now that the starburst mode is likely to represent only 10 of
the stars formed at z2 the cosmic peak of the star formation activity Rodighiereo
et al 2011
Already Greve et al 2005 showed that the SFE dened by the ratio of FIR
luminosity taken as an indicator of SFR to the CO luminosity indicator of the gas
mass was increasing signicantly with redshift reaching maxima around z2 for
submillimeter galaxies SMG with an SFE up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than
for local LIRGs The gas consumption time-scale being the inverse of the SFE
could then fall to 20 Myrs instead of the average 2 billion yrs locally
The redshift range between z02 and z1 is very important for the cosmic gas
evolution since it is the period when the cosmic star formation density drops by a
factor 10 and it corresponds to 40 of the universe age Unfortunately this domain
was not easily observed because of atmospheric lines and the need of sensitive
2mm instruments A sample of 69 ULIRG was observed in different CO lines with
the IRAM-30m precisely in this redshift range Combes et al 2011 2013 From the

galaxies where the gas excitation is known and from the dust masses derived from
the continuum emission the adoption of the ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor is
justied eg Solomon et al 1997 This ratio is 57 times smaller than the standard
ratio adopted for Milky Way-like galaxies The average molecular mass is however
145 1010 M an order of magnitude higher than in the Milky Way
Compiling this sample with other LIRGs and ULIRGs both the molecular gas to
stellar mass ratio and the SFE signicantly increase with redshift by factors of  3
from z  0 to 1 as shown in Figure 1 suggesting that both factors play an important
role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution
22 Main sequence galaxies
Not all star forming galaxies at z1-2 have a high SFE Some galaxies selected only
from their optical colors were detected in the CO lines with surprising high CO lu-
minosities Daddi et al 2008 These galaxies although still in the ULIRGs range
have a low gas excitation Dannerbauer et al 2009 and are relatively extended
They are interpreted as disk-like galaxies with steady star formation rate while the
most excited ULIRGs are nuclear starbursts It is possible that the Milky Way-like
conversion ratio applies for these objects which will further lower their SFE How-
ever the adoption of a bimodal conversion ratio leads to an articial bimodal star
formation regime separating the starbursts from the more quiescent disks with a
gap of an order of magnitude in gas consumption time-scales In reality there must

exist a continuous conversion ratio according to gas density temperature and other
factors like metallicity and the SF regimes are certainly continuous too
A continuity of galaxy properties between the two modes of star formation main
sequence and starburst is developed further by Daddi et al 2013 and Sargent et al
2014 Although starbursts have larger SFE it is not easy to know whether the cause
is a lack of gas may be the consequence of a short boost of star formation or an
excess of young stars If the starburst is triggered by a merger numerical simulations
show that gas is driven inwards by gravity torques from the outer reservoir and
more gas is then observable eg Di Matteo et al 2007 Montuori et al 2010 An
excess of fresh gas in star forming galaxies is also supported by the fundamental
mass-metallicity relation which precisely depends on SFR Manucci et al 2010
Starbursts have also a larger molecular gas to stellar mass ratio so their elevated
SFR is both due to a larger gas content and a larger SFE The latter could be due to
the larger central concentration of the gas and this will be claried through resolved
SFRgas density studies
The PHIBSS large program on the IRAM interferometer Tacconi et al 2010
2013 see also this conference has targeted a sample of massive star forming galax-
ies likely to be on the main sequence as dened in the stellar mass-SFR diagram
eg Wuyts et al 2011 From the 52 CO-detected objects at z1-3 the gas mass
fraction is found to increase with z up to 50 and decrease with mass Most of
the objects look like disks with regular rotation and are more steady star forming
disks than starbursts without any interaction or merger Since the molecular gas
Cosmic evolution of gas content and accretion
depletion time-scale is typically 07 Gyr and varies as 1z1 the star formation
must be fueled by gas accretion episodes which are frequent at high and moderate
redshift eg Combes 2014 The resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation obtained in a
few objects is compatible with a linear relation and a depletion time-scale lower at
high-z Freundlich et al 2013 Genzel et al 2013
In all these massive star forming galaxies atomic gas cannot be dominating the
cold gas since the sum of the molecular and stellar masses are so close to the dy-
namical mass Unless the CO-to-H2 conversion factor is largely in error the H2HI
ratio has indeed increased with z as predicted by models Another recent study sup-
ports this conclusion Decarli et al 2014 have carried out a blind molecular line
survey in the Hubble Deep Field North scanning the whole 3mm band with the
IRAM interferometer Their blind detection of 17 CO lines together with the up-
per limit obtained by stacking the observations towards spectroscopically identied
objects constrain the CO luminosity functions at the corresponding redshifts They
deduce that opticalMIR bright galaxies contribute less than 50 to the star forma-
tion rate density at 1  z  3 Their derived evolution of the H2 mass density is
compared to models in Figure 2
A recent 870m m continuum survey with ALMA of SMG in the Extended Chan-
dra Deep Field South Swinbank et al 2014 has discovered that the well detected
sources S870  2mJy are in average ULIRGs with SFR300 Myr The extrapola-
tion of the counts down to S870  1mJy show that these sources contribute to 20 of
the cosmic star formation density over z1-4 Deriving H2 masses from dust masses
the average SFE is found rather high with depletion time-scale of 130 Myr This is
to be compared to the compilation by Bauermeister et al 2013 who observed nor-
mal star forming galaxies in the redshift range z005-05 They nd a depletion
time-scale for normal galaxies of 760 Myr and for starbursts 60 Myr Their derived
molecular gas to stellar mass ratio is plotted in Figure 3 and is compatible with the
model-expected behavior
3 Models and simulations
Semi-analytical models SAM have been run within the standard L CDM model to
compute the cosmic evolution of the cold gas content in galaxies Lagos et al 2011
show that the best recipe to control the phase transition from atomic to molecular is
the pressure model Blitz  Rosolowsky 2006 rather than the theory-based model
from Krumholz et al 2009 taking into account UV-dissociation of molecules and
their reformation on grains In their best t model the H2HI ratio rises above one
at high redshift as in Obreschkow et al 2009 Fu et al 2010 2012 claim that the
Krumholz et al 2009 recipe is better but on a limited mass range Their best t
requires that the depletion time-scale remains 1-2 Gyr at high redshift
Using a simple phenomenological model Feldmann 2013 claims that the re-
lation between SFR and H2 content is likely to be linear at all redshift This as-
sumption provides the best t to the data ie the cosmic star formation history

the evolution of the mass-metallicity relation and the gas-to-stellar mass ratio in
galaxies This means that the variation of SFE with redshift might be too little to
be sensitive Models where the SFR relation is non-linear with gas density produce
too much stars and metals early on to be compatible with the observations To ob-
tain the right star formation histories gas accretion must be limited to a halo mass
range between a critical minimum mass Mcz below which photoionisation limits
the baryon fraction and an upper limit Mshock 2 1012 M above which the gas is
heated by shocks in entering the galaxy Birnboim  Dekel 2003 At early epochs
for redshifts higher than 2 the gas accretion time-scale is very short and the SFR
not enough to consume the accreted gas which accumulates in galaxies After z2
the SFR has increased to its maximum within the halo mass range between Mc and
Mshock the depletion time-scale is comparable to the accretion time-scale and the
SFR is limited by gas accretion Bouche et al 2010 In this global model an equi-
librium settles between gas inow and outow and star formation rate equalling
depletion time to accretion time Stellar masses metallicity and cosmic gas evolu-
tion are moderated by this equilibrium
The relation between SFR and stellar mass on the main sequence has been ex-
amined in detail from 25 studies in the literature and the corresponding slope is a
decreasing function of cosmic time Speagle et al 2014 The star formation his-
tories derived from these are delayed-t models where the SFR is rst increasing
Cosmic evolution of gas content and accretion
linearly with time in the rst half of the universe age and then decreasing exponen-
tially
With a SAM approach Popping et al 2012 2014 also tested several recipes for
the molecular gas and star formation evolution either pressure-based or metallicity-
based models represent rather well observations with some variations for low mass
galaxies To compare with high-z observations they deduce their gas content from
their SFR through inversion of the Kennicutt-Schmidt KS relation but in this case
the best t is for a density-dependent SFE Also the CO-to-H2 conversion factor
should be continuous as a function of the galaxy physical properties
That the SFE should depend on gas surface density non-linear KS relation is
certainly a solution to explain why SFE varies with redshift Galaxies were more
compact at high z Newman et al 2012 Morishita et al 2014 so not only their
surface density was higher for a given gas content but also their dynamical time was
shorter which favors the dynamical triggers Another feature is the volumic density
dependency which could play a role even for a linear KS relation It has already
been observed that SFE is declining with radius in galaxy disks at z0 possibly due
to gas disk aring Bigiel et al 2010 Dessauges-Zavadsky et al 2014
There are still large uncertainties on key factors to determine the cosmic evolu-
tion of cold gas content in galaxies not only the SFR laws as a function of density
the phase transition between atomic and molecular gas but also the star forma-
tion efciency regulated by feedback mechanisms due to supernovae or AGN the
quenching due to environment slowing down the gas accretion We are just at the
beginning of the ALMA era and our knowledge on these physical processes will
progress exponentially
