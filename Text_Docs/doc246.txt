ABSTRACT
Galaxy clusters provide powerful laboratories for the study of galaxy evolution particularly the
origin of correlations of morphology and star formation rate SFR with density We construct visible
to MIR spectral energy distributions SEDs of cluster galaxies and use them to measure stellar masses
and SFRs in eight low redshift clusters which we examine as a function of environment A partial
correlation analysis indicates that SFR depends strongly on RR200  999 condence and is
independent of projected local density at xed radius SFR also shows no residual dependence on
stellar mass We therefore conclude that interactions with the intra-cluster medium drive the evolution
of SFRs in cluster galaxies A merged sample of galaxies from the ve most complete clusters shows
hSF Ri  RR2001307 for galaxies with RR200  04 A decline in the fraction of SFGs toward
the cluster center contributes most of this eect but it is accompanied by a reduction in SFRs among
star-forming galaxies SFGs near the cluster center The increase in the fraction of SFGs toward
larger RR200 and the isolation of SFGs with reduced SFRs near the cluster center are consistent
with ram pressure stripping as the mechanism to truncate star formation in galaxy clusters We
conclude that stripping drives the properties of SFGs over the range of radii we examine We also
nd that galaxies near the cluster center are more massive than galaxies farther out in the cluster
at  35 which suggests that cluster galaxies experience dynamical relaxation during the course of
their evolution

1 INTRODUCTION
1997 Postman et al 2005
The current paradigm for the evolution of the uni-
verse and the growth of structure is based largely on
observations of the luminous matter in the universe ie
individual galaxies groups and clusters and the cos-
mic microwave background While galaxy formation
physics could previously be neglected the era of precision
cosmology increasingly demands detailed knowledge of
galaxy formation to map observations of luminous mat-
ter onto dark matter halos eg van Daalen et al 2011
To do so precisely we must understand the relationship
between galaxy evolution and environment
Galaxy formation theory dates to the middle of the
twentieth century
Early work explored the physi-
cal processes responsible for star-formation Whipple
1946 speculated about the origins of the Milky Way
Eggen et al 1962 and examined the impact of envi-
ronment on galaxy evolution Spitzer  Baade 1951
Osterbrock 1960 discovered that star-forming galax-
ies SFGs are less common in galaxy clusters than
in lower density environments and this result was
subsequently re-examined with larger samples Gisler
1978 Dressler et al 1985 The dearth of vigorous
star formation in galaxy clusters is mirrored by an
under-abundance of spiral galaxies in these high den-
sity regions known as the morphology-density relation

The impact of environment on the frequency and
intensity of star-formation has been studied intensely
in galaxy clusters and also at a variety of other density
scales These measurements have employed both visible
wavelength colors Kodama  Bower 2001 Balogh et al
2004 Barkhouse et al 2009 Hansen et al 2009 and
emission lines Abraham et al 1996 Balogh et al 1997
2000 Kaumann et al 2004 Christlein  Zabludo
2005 Poggianti et al
Braglia et al 2009 von der Linden et al 2010 as well
as mid-infrared MIR luminosities Bai et al 2006
Saintonge et al 2008 Bai et al 2009 SFGs are con-
sistently found to be more common and to have higher
SFRs in lower density environments and at higher
redshifts Kaumann et al 2004 Poggianti et al 2006
2008 This trend appears to reverse by z  2 with
star formation more common in clusters than in the
eld Tran et al 2010 Hatch et al 2011 However
even high-z cluster galaxies form their stars earlier than
coeval eld galaxies Rettura et al 2011 which is an
expression of the so-called downsizing phenomenon
Cowie et al 1996
The relationships between SFR morphology and en-
vironment in the local universe place strong constraints
on models for galaxy evolution Another important fac-
tor is the presence of an evolutionary trend for galax-
ies to have higher SFRs at higher redshifts This was
originally reported as an excess of blue cluster mem-
bers at z  04 compared to z  0 Oemler 1974
Butcher  Oemler 1978 1984 and is commonly known
Atlee et al
at the Butcher-Oemler Eect This trend is now under-
stood to track the simultaneous increase in the fraction
of star-forming galaxies SFGs and in the SFRs of indi-
vidual SFGs An analogous trend has been examined
in the MIR Saintonge et al 2008 Haines et al 2009
Tran et al 2010 Hatch et al 2011 which is sensitive
to dust-enshrouded star formation
cold gas
These mechanisms
The observed trends in star formation with en-
these trends with
vironment and the variation of
redshift are usually attributed to changes
sizes of cold gas reservoirs
Several mechanisms
have been proposed to reduce galaxies cold gas
supplies and transform them from SFGs to passive

and interactions with the cluster tidal potential Merritt
1983 1984 Natarajan et al 1998 Gas starvation
operates throughout clusters and it converts galax-
ies from star forming to passive on a gas exhaustion
timescale which for normal spiral galaxies is  25 Gyr
Bigiel et al 2011 This time is similar to the cluster
crossing time of 24 Gyr which is the timescale appro-
priate for dynamical processes like galaxy harassment
These timescales contrast sharply with the timescale ap-
propriate for RPS which truncates star formation on a
gas stripping timescale which is of order 105 yr The e-
ciency of RPS also scales with ICM density so it operates
much more strongly near cluster centers than either star-
vation or harassment These dierences mean that how
rapidly star formation declines in cluster galaxies relative
to the eld constrains the mechanism primarily respon-
sible for the removal of cold gas from cluster galaxies
The variation of SFR with environment can probe the
relative importance of dierent environmental processes
but the conclusions drawn from apparently similar ob-
servations sometimes conict For example Moran et al
2007 identied passive spirals in a sample of z  05
clusters and determined that spiral galaxies rapidly turn
passive when they enter the cluster environment and
then evolve into S0 galaxies Bai et al 2009 argue
that the similarity of the 24m luminosity functions
observed in galaxy clusters and in the eld suggests
that the transition from star-formation to quiescence
must be rapid which implies that ram pressure strip-
ping RPS is the dominant mechanism Verdugo et al
2008 and von der Linden et al 2010 by contrast
nd a signicant trend of increasing SFR with radius
to at least 2R200 from cluster centers Because the trend
of SFR with radius appears to extend to the virial shock
White  Frenk 1991 von der Linden et al 2010 con-
clude that preprocessing at the group scale is important
Patel et al 2009 nd a similar trend for increasing av-
erage SFR with decreasing local density down to group-
scale densities gal  10 Mpc2
Evidence for pre-processing in groups is important be-
cause RPS is inecient in low density gas so preprocess-
ing Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998 Fujita 2004 is likely
driven by processes like gas starvation that operate in
less dense environments While preprocessing appears to
be important in some groups and clusters Berrier et al
2009 found that very few cluster galaxies have previ-
ously resided in groups so the impact of preprocessing
on a typical cluster galaxy must be limited
In Atlee et al 2011 henceforth Paper I we devel-
oped a multi-wavelength method to identify AGNs based
on either their X-ray luminosities or the shapes of their
visible-MIR spectral energy distributions SEDs In this
paper we will employ this method to correct for AGNs
and measure star formation in cluster galaxies We use
the results to study the relationship between star for-
mation and the cluster environment In particular we
consider the constraints placed on the important envi-
ronmental processes that operate in clusters by the dis-
tribution of star formation among cluster members
The paper is organized as follows In 2 we review
our observations which are discussed in more detail in
Paper I In 3 we review the mathematical formalism as-
sociated with partial correlation analysis In 4 we derive
completeness corrections for the observed cluster mem-
bers We discuss the derivation of total infrared TIR
luminosity functions LFs in 5 and in 6 we detail the
results of our measurements Finally we examine the
implications of these results for the environmental de-
pendence of galaxy evolution in 7 and we summarize
these conclusions in 8 Throughout this paper we adopt
the WMAP 5-year cosmologya -CDM universe with
m  026   074 and h  072 Dunkley et al
2 OBSERVATIONS AND MEMBER DESCRIPTION
Paper I provides details of our photometry and spec-
troscopy
It also develops methods to reliably identify
low-luminosity AGNs and to measure galaxy properties
like stellar mass and SFRs for identied cluster members
including AGN hosts We briey summarize the salient
points below
21 Observations
We identied cluster member galaxies using redshifts
determined by Martini et al 2007 We supplemented
these with redshifts from the literature which we ob-
tained from the NASA Extragalactic Database NED2
These redshifts come from a variety of sources with un-
known selection functions and success rates See 4
We have visible-wavelength images from the du Pont
telescope at Las Campanas observatory MIR images
from the IRAC and MIPS instruments on the Spitzer
Space Telescope and X-ray images extracted from the
Chandra archive We measure visible MIR and X-
ray uxes in redshift-dependent photometric apertures
that approximate a xed metric size The aperture
uxes are then corrected to total uxes at constant color
with the R-band Kron-like magnitude from SExtractor
Bertin  Arnouts 1996 Our photometry spans the
peak of the stellar continuum so we have robust pho-
tometric redshifts which can identify catastrophic errors
among the spectroscopic redshifts We found 12 such
catastrophic errors one of which is an AGN Paper I
We exclude these objects from our analysis

Environmental Eects on SF
22 Cluster Member Description and AGN
Identication
In Paper I we constructed spectral energy distribu-
tions SEDs from the photometry described in 21 and
we t models to these uxes with SED template codes
from Assef et al 2010 These model SEDs are used
to derive photometric redshifts and K-corrections We
also employed the models to measure MIR color correc-
tions and we used the results to determine rest-frame
luminosities
We employ rest-frame visible wavelength colors to de-
termine the mass to light ratio of each galaxy in the
sample Bell  de Jong 2001 and we combine these
with the measured luminosities to infer M To mea-
sure SFRs we employ both 8m and 24m luminosi-
ties Zhu et al 2008 When SFRs can be measured in
both bands we take the geometric mean of the two mea-
surements We found in Paper I that SFRs determined
independently from 8m and 24m luminosities show a
scatter of  02 dex with respect to one another This
scatter reects the systematic uncertainty in SFR mea-
surements determined from either band separately and
the implied uncertainty is comparable to the systematic
uncertainties in the measured stellar masses  03 dex
Paper I
Before we measure stellar masses and SFRs of cluster
members we identify and correct for AGNs We employ
two independenty methods to identify AGNs the shapes
of the model SEDs IR AGNs and the X-ray luminosi-
ties measured with Chandra X-ray AGNs The hosts
of IR AGNs are corrected for the presence of the AGN
before we calculate M and SFR X-ray AGNs without
visible signatures in their SEDs do not contribute signif-
icantly to the measured visible and MIR uxes so we do
not correct those objects In Paper I we found that the
IR and X-ray AGN samples are largely disjoint This im-
plies that X-ray only AGN selection can overlook a large
fraction  35 of AGNs We explore the potential
consequences of this bias in 65 and 66
3 PARTIAL CORRELATION ANALYSIS
When confronted with a system of mutually correlated
observables it can be dicult to establish which vari-
ables drive the correlations Partial correlation anal-
ysis measures the relationship between two variables
with all other parameters held xed and can identify
which variables control the observed correlations Par-
tial correlation analysis has been applied in the past
to develop a fundamental plane of black hole activity
Merloni et al 2003 and to probe the dependence of
SFR on both stellar mass and environment simultane-
ously Christlein  Zabludo 2005 We will use the sim-
plest formulation of partial correlation analysis which
relies only on direct measurements and does not account
for upper limits
The simplest case is a system of only three variables
xi This is called the rst-order partial correlation prob-
lem The correlation coecient for x1 and x2 at xed x3
can be expressed as
r123 
12  1323
131  2
p1  2
where ij is the standard two-variable correlation coe-
cient eg the Pearson or Spearman coecients between
xi and xj Wall  Jenkins 2003 Higher order problems
describe systems with more variables For a system of N
variables the N  2th order partial correlation coe-
cient rij1N ij of variables xi and xj can be written
rij1N ij  Cij
pCiiCjj
where Cij  1ijMij Kendell  Stuart 1977 Mij
is a reduced determinant of the correlation matrix R
where Rij  ij  and ij is the two-variable correlation
coecient of xi and xj The determinant Mij can be
interpreted as the total correlation among the variables
of the system in the absence of i and j
It is calcu-
lated from R with the ith row and jth column eliminated
Kendell  Stuart 1977
Given a partial correlation coecient from Eq 2 we
would like to know its signicance This can be evaluated
from ij1N ij
ij1N ij 
1  rij1N ij
m  N
where rij1N ij is the partial correlation coecient
given by Eq 2 N is the number of variables in the sys-
tem and m is the number of objects in the sample The
statistical signicance of rij1N ij is determined from
the Students t-distribution with dispersion ij1N ij
Wall  Jenkins 2003
Partial correlation analyses can take both parametric
and non-parametric forms These are analogous to the
more commonly applied two-variable correlation analy-
ses Equation 2 can be applied to any of the correlation
coecients in common use However Eq 3 is dened
for the parametric Pearsons correlation coecient so it
is appropriate only for that estimator or the closely re-
lated non-parametric Spearman coecient We want a
non-parametric approach so we rely on Spearman cor-
relation coecients in our analysis
4 COMPLETENESS CORRECTIONS
We wish to examine the distributions of the stellar
masses and SFRs described in 22 to probe the impact
of the cluster environment on galaxy growth However
to do this we must rst correct for selection eects The
spectroscopic selection function that denes our sample
is unknown because many of the sources that contribute
to the redshifts in the literature do not dene their tar-
get selection functions or rates of success Furthermore
the MIR observations do not uniformly cover the clus-
ter elds Therefore we empirically determine both our
spectroscopic and MIR selection functions to correct for
these eects
41 Spectroscopic Completeness
We examine only spectroscopically-conrmed cluster
members Many of the redshifts we use come from
Martini et al 2007 which we supplemented with red-
shifts from other sources in the literature This results in
a complex selection function that is poorly known a pri-
ori However this completeness function is required to
correct the properties of observed cluster galaxies to the
intrinsic distribution for all cluster members We take
Atlee et al
an empirical approach to determine spectroscopic com-
pleteness and correct the measured cluster members to
the total cluster galaxy population
For each cluster we bin galaxies identied in the pho-
tometric source catalog by V  R color R-band magni-
tude and RR200 We nd signicant variations in the
fraction of galaxies with spectra fspec as a function of
RR200 and mR but the variation with color is at most
minor A partial correlation analysis of fspec as a func-
tion of color magnitude and position shows no signi-
cant partial correlation with V  R at 95 condence
in any cluster while fspec correlates with both mR and
RR200 at  999 condence We therefore collapse
the measurement along the color axis and determine the
fraction of galaxies with spectroscopy as a function of
R-magnitude and position only This results in better
measurements due to the larger number of galaxies per
The fspec measured above is one way to express
the spectroscopic completeness of galaxies in a given
magnitude-radius bin However what we really want is
an expression for the spectroscopic completeness Cspec
of cluster members
Cspecx 
NClspecx
NClx
Nspecx
Ntotx 
NClspecx
Nspecx 
Ntotx
NClx
where x is the position of a given bin in magnitude-radius
space NClspec is the number of galaxies with spectra
that are cluster members NCl is the number of true clus-
ter members Nspec is the number of galaxies with spectra
in the cluster eld and Ntot is the number of galaxies in
the input catalog All of these quantities except NCl can
be measured directly from the input catalogs We would
need to infer NCl using some additional piece of infor-
mation so we prefer to rely on fspec rather than Cspec if
possible
If the redshifts reported in the literature were not pre-
selected for cluster membership or if the redshift fail-
ure rate was high fspecx would be a good proxy for
Cspecx and the approach in Eq 4 would be unneces-
sary If this were the case the fraction of galaxies with
spectra that are cluster members fmem should drop
with RR200 as the fraction of eld galaxies increases
Figure 1 shows that fmem does not always trace the de-
cline in the density of cluster galaxies This implies that
fspec is not a good tracer of Cspec and the more sophis-
ticated approach of Eq 4 is required
Before we can employ Eq 4 we need to know the num-
ber of cluster galaxies in each bin To do this we esti-
mate the number of eld galaxies in the bin with the
R-band magnitude-number density relation reported by
Kummel  Wagner 2001 We subtract the eld galax-
ies from the total number of galaxies in the bin to esti-
mate the number of cluster galaxies
This approach introduces two types of uncertainty
The rst is simple Poisson counting uncertainty due to
the small number of eld galaxies typically a few to 10
in each bin The second is cosmic variance Ellis 1987
reports a B-band magnitude-number relation that in-
cludes measurements from a number of other authors
The dierent surveys use elds of dierent sizes so the
Fig 1 Comparison of galaxy density upper panel and spec-
troscopic membership fraction lower panel as a function of radius
for the clusters in our sample with enough conrmed members to
make a meaningful measurement If fspec were a good proxy for
fClspec the upper and lower panels would have similar slopes
None of the clusters in the sample exhibit this behavior
scatter of their results about the best-t relation provide
a measure of the cosmic variance which contributes of
order 10 uncertainty on the number of eld galaxies in
a typical bin The number of eld galaxies in a given bin
depends on magnitude and cluster mass but it gener-
ally ranges from 1-10 galaxies At faint magnitudes the
number of eld galaxies is generally comparable to the
number of cluster galaxies and Poisson uctuations in
the number of eld galaxies dominate the uncertainties
in the completeness measurements The spectroscopic
completeness measurements and associated uncertainties
for each cluster are summarized in Table 1
Figure 2 shows the spectroscopic completeness Cspec
for 6 of the 8 galaxy clusters in our sample The re-
maining 2 clusters A644 and A2163 have too few con-
rmed members to make a reliable measurement The
dashed vertical lines on the right column of Figure 2
indicate the observed magnitude that corresponds to
MR  20 for the average K-correction in each cluster
The follow-up spectroscopy of X-ray sources conducted
by Martini et al 2006 is only complete to this luminos-
ity limit Clearly completeness becomes quite poor for
MR  20 in all clusters so we restrict our sample to
galaxies with MR  20
We also considered completeness as a function of lumi-
nosity and stellar mass instead of mR However these
quantities have higher uncertainties than observed mag-
nitudes especially for galaxies without spectroscopic red-
shifts to x their distances Therefore we measure com-
pletness as a function of mR and RR200
42 Mid-Infrared Completeness
The depth of the MIR images varies as a function of
position across the clusters This is a result of the Spitzer
mosaicking schemes which were chosen to provide good
coverage of the known X-ray point sources in the cluster
These mosaic schemes lead to variations in the number
of overlapping images and therefore to variations in sen-

sitivity across the cluster elds
In addition to these sensitivity variations the Spitzer
footprint features some non-overlapping coverage by the
dierent IRAC bands This results from the IRAC map-
ping strategy which simultaneously images two adjacent
elds in dierent bands The pointings chosen by the ob-
server then determine the degree of overlap between the
IRAC channels For a galaxy to enter the nal sample
it must include detections in at least 5 bands to ensure
that the t results for that galaxy are well constrained
This means that a faint galaxy in a region of a cluster
with overlapping 36m and 45m images for example
might be more likely to appear in the nal sample than
an identical galaxy in a part of the cluster with only
45m coverage
To construct ensemble statistics for whole clusters
we require sensitivity corrections that account for vari-
able depth across the cluster elds and for the dier-
ent footprints in the Spitzer bands We again take
an empirical approach to completeness correction We
measure the MIR ux uncertainties at the locations of
all conrmed cluster members from the Spitzer uncer-
tainty mosaics At each position we combine the two
Assef et al 2010 star-forming templates with arbitrary
ux normalizations 1000 times to produce galaxies with
102  SF R1 M yr1  102 From these articial
galaxy SEDs we construct model uxes and determine
whether the galaxy represented by each SED would have
been detected at 3 based on the ux uncertainty at
each position We bin the results by ux and by RR200
to estimate completeness separately at 8m and 24m
Figure 3 shows the results of this measurement for the
6 clusters in Figure 2 IRAC and MIPS completenesses
clearly depend on both ux and RR200
The uncertainties in MIR completeness result from the
Fig 3 MIR completeness as a function of ux for the 8m left
and the 24m right Spitzer bands In each column the sample
has been separated into 4 radial bins Fluxes have not been color-
corrected and are given in the observer frame Uncertainties are
shown for a single radial bin to indicate typical values MS 10081-
1224 was not observed with MIPS Completeness measurements
are derived as described in 42
incomplete spectroscopic sampling of the galaxies in a
given bin We implicitly assume that the identied clus-
ter members in each bin are representative of the be-
havior of the unidentied members This assumption
means that the precision of the completeness correction
in a given bin is xed by the number of identied clus-
ter members in that bin The completeness we measure
CMIR is our best estimate of the true MIR complete-
ness Ctrue
MIR associated with a hypothetical spectroscopi-
cally complete sample of galaxies In a bin with N clus-
ter members the expected number of detections is sim-
ply Ctrue
MIRN  However the actual number of detections
will have some range around Ctrue
MIRN  which leads to an
uncertainty in the inversion of CMIR to a completeness
correction This uncertainty is set by the expected vari-
ation in the number of galaxies which is best described
by binomial statistics This allows calculation of asym-
metric error bars on CMIR and accounts naturally for
upper and lower limits Typical uncertainties returned
by this procedure are  20 The full set of MIR com-
pleteness measurements and the associated uncertainties
are summarized in Table 2
43 Merged Cluster Sample
We have dened the MIR completeness measurements
in Figure 3 so they apply only to galaxies with spectro-
scopic redshifts The two corrections applied serially
give total completeness corrections The total correction
XG for a galaxy G is
CspecRGR200 mRG 
CMIRRGR200 fG
where Cspec is the spectroscopic completeness Figure 2
and CMIR is the MIR completeness Figure 3 The com-
pleteness corrections described by Eq 6 can be applied
to individual galaxies to extrapolate from the measured
galaxy samples to the full cluster population In cases
Atlee et al
where multiple corrections can be derived for a single ob-
ject we combine these corrections in the same way the
data are combined For example the completeness cor-
rection for a galaxy with SFR measurements from both
22
8m and 24m uxes is given by X  cid2X8mX24mcid312
because SF R  cid2SF R8mSF R24mcid312
To examine the dependence of star formation and black
hole growth on environment we need to construct a
merged cluster galaxy sample We identify 5 clusters
A3128 A2104 A1689 MS1008 and AC114 with the
best completeness estimates and combine their members
The relatively small number of galaxies in A3125 results
in highly irregular behavior of the completeness func-
tions As a result any corrections we applied would
depend critically on the binning scheme We therefore
exclude it from the main cluster sample
The clusters in the main sample can be stacked to yield
better statistics To construct the stacked cluster we
weight individual galaxies by their completeness correc-
tions XG The correction is a combination of the spec-
troscopic and photometric completeness corrections from
41 and 42 as given by Eqs 4-6
5 LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
Luminosity functions LFs provide an important di-
agnostic for the dierence between cluster galaxies and
eld populations because LFs are sensitive to the en-
tire cluster population rather than only the average For
example Bai et al 2009 employed the total infrared
TIR LF to infer that RPS controls the evolution of
SFRs in cluster galaxies In this section we discuss the
derivation of total infrared TIR luminosities and our
method to construct luminosity functions We discuss
the results in 64
51 Total Infrared Luminosity
Our MIR observations cover a relatively narrow wave-
length range from 36m to 24m To compare our re-
sults with previous studies we need to infer LT IR from
the observed L8m and L24m so we must apply bolo-
metric corrections BCs To estimate LT IR from the
Spitzer luminosities we employ the Dale  Helou 2002
SED template library which includes a wide variety of
SEDs These SEDs dier from one another according
to the parameter  which describes the intensity of the
radiation eld on a typical dust grain
Before we calculate BCs for IR AGNs we rst sub-
tract the AGN contribution Paper I We then t each
Dale  Helou 2002 template to the rest-frame 58 80
and 24m uxes and use the template that best ts the
data to measure our ducial BCs In the frequent cases
where luminosities in one or more of these bands are
unavailable we estimate the missing luminosities from
model SEDs Assef et al 2010 When this is necessary
we assign uncertainties to the model uxes from the un-
certainties on the model SED We only calculate LT IR
for galaxies with detections in at least one of the 8m
and 24m bands
In galaxies that have measurements of both L8m and
L24m we calculate LT IR separately for each band and
take the geometric mean of the results This follows our
treatment of SFRs in Paper I In other cases we sim-
ply use the BC appropriate for the band where we have
a detection Typical BCs are  6 for L8m and  8
for L24m We also construct 68 condence intervals
for each BC based on the 2  1 interval for each
galaxy These uncertainties are asymmetric and they
add in quadrature to the uncertainties on L8 and L24 to
give the total uncertainty on LT IR
52 Luminosity Function Construction
We construct luminosity functions from galaxies in
the main cluster sample whose luminositiesLT IR 
l we determine as described in 51 If we account
for the uncertainties on LT IR we can reduce our sensi-
tivity to Poisson uctuations in the number of luminous
galaxies We distribute the galaxy weights described
in 4 over luminosity bins according to the probability
that the true luminosity of a galaxy with best-estimate
L  LT IR lies in a given bin Due to the uncertainty
on the LF prior this technique increases the statistical
uncertainty on the total weight in each bin by  10 In
exchange we reduce the much larger uncertainty intro-
duced by stochasticity in the number luminous galaxies
To distribute galaxy weights over luminosity bins
we employ an asymmetric probability density function
PDF that considers l and u separately We inte-
grate the PDF across each luminosity bin to determine
the weight in each bin which we add to construct the
total LF The PDF we employ is piecewise smooth and
it approaches the Normal distribution when u  l It
is described in more detail in Appendix A
In addition to the PDF we require a prior on the shape
of the LF to correct for Eddington-like bias due to the
steepness of the LF above L We adopt a Schechter
function t to the Coma cluster LF from Bai et al 2006
as the baseline prior We then correct the Coma LF to
the redshift of each individual cluster according to the
evolution of the eld galaxy LF Le Floch et al 2005
We add the uncertainty on the prior to the statistical
uncertainty on the LF in each luminosity bin The prior
has a strong impact on the bright-end shape of the LF
because there are few cluster galaxies to constrain the
LF in this regime The results are discussed in 64
6 RESULTS
We apply the weights derived from the completeness
corrections described in 4 to the main cluster sample
which is a subset of the cluster galaxies in Table 3 These
corrections allow us to examine the average environmen-
tal dependence of M 62 and SFR 63-65 and the
redshift dependence of star formation 66 Before con-
ducting these analyses we perform a partial correlation
analysis to determine which observed properties of galax-
ies in clusters most strongly correlate with star formation
61 The results inform the rest of our work
61 Partial Correlation Analysis
The cluster environment can signicantly alter the
evolution of cluster member galaxies as described in
1 However when we attempt to distinguish be-
tween the physical properties that might cause these ef-
fects we confront a system of mutually-correlated ob-
servables For example SFR depends on both pro-
jected local galaxy density to the 10th nearest neigh-

While the causal connection between morphology and
the local density of galaxies is well established eg
Dressler 1980 Dressler et al 1999 Postman et al 2005
Moran et al 2007 nd strong evidence that the mor-
phologies and star-formation rates of massive spiral
galaxies in clusters evolve separately This implies that
a factor other than local density may control star for-
mation in cluster galaxies Because M RR200 and
projected local density 10 are all mutually correlated
it is not easy to determine which variables drive the
environmental dependence of star formation Therefore
we use a partial correlation analysis to disentangle these
dependencies The mathematical formalism for partial
correlation analysis is described in 3 We do not con-
sider completeness corrections for this analysis so we
include galaxies from all 8 clusters
We consider only objects with measurements of all pa-
rameters under consideration and ignore galaxies with
upper limits This diers from the similar analysis con-
ducted by Christlein  Zabludo 2005 who also con-
sidered upper limits As a result our results are more
sensitive than Christlein  Zabludo 2005 to system-
atic eects like variations in sensitivity within or between
clusters Because of this we do not rely directly on the
strength of any partial correlations but only on the pres-
ence or absence of such correlations For variables with
signicant partial correlations we perform stacking anal-
yses which can account for incompleteness See 62-
66
We perform a partial correlation study on a sys-
tem of ve variables

SFR M RR200
Table 4 shows that SFR depends strongly on RR200
rSpartial  034 but it shows no signicant de-
pendence of SFR on M once the inuence of RR200
has been factored out rSpartial  009 This con-
icts with earlier results which generally nd either
that SFR depends only on M Grutzbauch et al 2011
Rettura et al 2011 or that SFR depends on both M
and environment Christlein  Zabludo 2005 One
reason for this discrepancy is that Table 4 does not in-
clude non-SFGs The fraction of non-SFGs is higher
among more massive galaxies which introduces a depen-
dence of hSF Ri on M Another possible factor is the
dierence in stellar masses we examine The samples of
Grutzbauch et al 2011 and Rettura et al 2011 ex-
tend down only to  3  1010M while our sample
extends to approximately 1010M If the cluster envi-
ronment aects lower mass galaxies more strongly we
should be more sensitive to this eect Because the e-
ciency of RPS should depend on M our expanded mass
range improves our ability to distinguish between RPS

and gas starvation
Interestingly SFR also shows no residual dependence
on 10 rSpartial  002 which suggests that the
SFRs of cluster members are driven by the local condi-
tions of the ICM rather than by interactions with nearby
galaxies We emphasize that this conclusion applies to
SFR only and we do not consider the dependence of mor-
phology on 10 or RR200 This result is also consistent
with results from previous authors Poggianti et al 1999
Moran et al 2006 2007 who found that the processes
that alter SFR and morphology are likely to be physically
distinct The determination that SFR is more closely re-
lated to RR200 than to 10 distinguishes our results
from those of Christlein  Zabludo 2005 who do not
discriminate between dierent environmental tracers As
a result they are agnostic about the processes that
drive the hSF Riradius relation Our analysis also relies
on SFGs alone which distinguishes it from the work of
Christlein  Zabludo 2005 who included upper lim-
its for galaxies with no measurable star formation This
accounts for the lack of a strong anti-correlation between
M and SFR which is driven by a decline in the frac-
tion of SFGs at higher M rather than a reduction in the
SFRs of individual SFGs
SFR also shows no relationship to local substructure
as measured by  at xed RR200
Indeed even a
two-variable correlation test returns no correlation be-
tween  and SFR rS  003 This conicts with
Christlein  Zabludo 2005 who reported a strong
correlation of SFR with local substructure However
 requires a robust spectroscopic sample from which to
measure local velocity dispersions As a result the sub-
structure measurements for some of our clusters with less
complete spectroscopy are probably unreliable We re-

62 MassRadius Relation
In 61 we reported a strong correlation of SFR with
RR200 but no residual dependence of SFR on M or M
on radius This might indicate that M is independent
of environment as von der Linden et al 2010 found
However it might also mean that the SFRRR200 cor-
relation is strong enough to eclipse any more subtle cor-
relations that might appear among a sample composed
entirely of SFGs The galaxy sample examined in 61
includes only a few hundred galaxies and the sample
preferentially excludes the most massive galaxies which
tend not to show active star formation As a result
61 might show no correlation between M and RR200
even if the full cluster galaxy sample includes one
Christlein  Zabludo 2005 found a strong partial cor-
relation of mass with RR200 This correlation would be
dicult to produce if BCGs alone produce a false correla-
tion of M with RR200 as von der Linden et al 2010
claim because normal cluster galaxies are much more
numerous than BCGs
To test whether our data support the presence of a
radial trend in M we look for direct variations of M
with RR200 without regard to correlations with other
variables We rst divide the galaxy sample into two
samples with equal numbers of galaxies and we apply
a K-S test to check for a dierence between their ra-
dial distributions For this analysis we include members
of all 8 clusters and we exclude BCGs as dened by
von der Linden et al 2007 from the sample The re-
Fig 6 Average stellar mass for galaxies in the stacked cluster
sample as a function of radius Brightest cluster galaxies are ex-
cluded from the t because of their unusually large stellar masses
and SFRs compared to other galaxies near the centers of clusters
The heavy line indicates the best-t power-law to the 6 outer bins
The two innermost radial bins were excluded from the t based
on their large excesses This resulted in a reduction in total 2
from 91 to 10 The best t yields M  cid2RR200cid30402 and
the shaded region indicates the 68 condence interval to the t
The residuals are shown in the lower panel
sults are shown in Figure 5a The K-S test returns a
probability  01 that the high- and low-mass samples
have the same radial distributions so massive galaxies
are preferentially found closer to the centers of their par-
ent clusters even in the absence of BCGs We weight
members of the main cluster sample by their complete-
ness to determine the average mass as a function of ra-
dius The average mass in a given bin is
hMi 
i0cid2wiMicid3
i0cid2wicid3
where N is the number of galaxies in the bin with MR 
20 The wi are the weights derived from Eq 4 Figure
6 shows the resulting average masses as a function of
radius
The innermost radial bin Figure 6 shows a strong ex-
cess compared to the other bins and the second bin hints
at an excess We t a power law to the six outer ra-
dial bins in Figure 6 solid line to measure the strength
of the mass excess in these bins and to determine why
our results dier from von der Linden et al 2010 The
slight increase of hMi with RR200 beyond R  01R200
is consistent with the tendency of massive galaxies to be
accreted more recently than less massive galaxies and for
recently accreted galaxies to lie further out in the cluster
De Lucia et al 2011 Alternatively galaxies presently
near the center of the cluster spend more time near the
cluster center on average than galaxies farther away
Therefore they are subject to stronger tidal forces from
the cluster potential and will lose more of their mass
Merritt 1983 1984 Natarajan et al 1998 The large
uncertainties on the t preclude any attempt to distin-
guish between these scenarios
Figure 6 shows that the average masses of galaxies near
Environmental Eects on SF
the cluster center show an excess compared to their coun-
terparts further out in the cluster The innermost ra-
dial bin in Figure 6 diers from the best t model by
28 and the mass excess in the second radial bin is
signicant at 18 This indicates that the cluster core
R  005R200 tends to host more massive galaxies than
the outer regions even if we neglect BCGs Mass segre-
gation among cluster galaxies can be introduced as the
cluster relaxes to virial equilibrium The dynamical re-
laxation timescale in the inner mass bin for a cluster at
z  015 with   1200 km s1 is approximately 300
Myr so the core of a typical cluster in our sample should
be dynamically relaxed For the same typical cluster
the crossing time for the sphere dened by R  04R200
is approximately 900 Myr This crossing time implies a
dynamical relaxation time of 7 Gyr which is longer than
the age of a cluster at z  015 that assembled at z  1
58 Gyr so the sphere with R  04R200 has not yet
had time to relax
Finally Figure 6 suggests a reason for our disagreement
with von der Linden et al 2010 The signal comes pri-
marily inside 005R200 which corresponds to  15 at the
median redshift of the von der Linden et al 2010 sam-
ple z  08 Due to SDSS ber collisions only a few
galaxies inside 005R200 will have redshifts in each clus-
ter This shifts the median of the innermost radial bin in
the von der Linden et al 2010 sample to  008R200
This is comparable to the second radial bin in Figure 6
If this was our innermost bin we would not nd any de-
pendence of M on RR200 so the disagreement between
our results and von der Linden et al 2010 likely result
from ber collisions in SDSS
63 Environmental Dependence of SFR
In Paper I we examined the RR200 distributions of
AGNs and found no signicant dierence between the
positions of AGNs and normal cluster members The
lack of radial dependence among AGNs could due to the
small sample size it could indicate a weak dependence
of the amount of cold gas on RR200 or it might mean
that AGN fueling is poorly correlated with the total cold
gas reservoir of its host galaxy To test these hypothe-
ses we dene a sample of galaxies with 8m ux excesses
as those galaxies whose measured 8m ux exceeds the
ux expected from a passively evolving galaxy matched
in MK at more than 2 Figure 5b compares the radial
distributions of galaxies with and without an 8m excess
These objects include both SFGs and AGNs We again
excluded BCGs from these samples The radial distri-
bution of galaxies with 8m excesses is indistinguishable
from the merged sample but galaxies without an excess
are located closer to the centers of their host clusters
than the average cluster galaxy at 95 condence
The dependence
of dust
consistent with the
emission on RR200
shown in Figure 5b is
tablished dependence of SFR on position within
galaxy clusters Kodama  Bower 2001 Balogh et al

One way to test the origin of this eect and by extension
the SFRdensity and SFRradius relations is to measure
the average SFR as a function of radius We weight indi-
vidual SFGs by their total completeness Eq 6 and bin

upper panel with the 1 uncertainty given by the grey
region The red line shows the gradient predicted by
the gas starvation model of Book  Benson 2010 nor-
malized to minimize the 2 between the model and the
observed SFRs The model predicts the average SFR for
all non-BCG cluster members at z  0 so the higher red-
shift of the cluster galaxies in Figure 7 might explain the
shift in hSF Ri between the observations and the model
However even after we adjust the normalization of the
model it remains a poor t to the data 2
  32 but
the re-normalized model is marginally consistent with the
best-t power law within the large statistical uncertainty
on the t
Despite the signicant uncertainty in the power law
t to the SFRradius relation Figure 7 clearly demon-
Atlee et al
strates higher hSF Ri toward the outer regions of the
stacked cluster sample This mirrors the trend found
via partial correlation analysis in 61 which is signi-
cant at 999 condence A similar trend appears in
hsSF Ri as a function of radius which yields hsSF Ri 
RR2001006 To interpret Eq 9 in detail we need
a model that better agrees with the observations than
the Book  Benson 2010 model and that accounts for
projection eects the distribution of orbits followed by
cluster members and the eect of dierent environmen-
tal processes
The RPS scenario makes at least one clear qualitative
prediction that we can use to evaluate its impact without
a detailed model Because RPS operates quickly com-
pared to the cluster crossing time the radial variation
in hSF Ri should be caused by variations in the fraction
of SFGs fSF  and there should be little change in the
SFRs of individual galaxies The middle panel of Fig-
ure 7 shows that fSF declines strongly near the cluster
center which is consistent with RPS We also see lower
hSF Ri among SFGs with R  01 R200 compared to
SFGs with R  01R200 bottom panel This dierence
is formally signicant at  999 condence so SFGs
with R  01R200 experience a clear reduction in their
SFRs as they transition to passive evolution However
a t to hSF RiSF G versus RR200 shows no signicant
trend so the reduction in SFR at R  01R200 may be a
sharp transition rather than a gradual decline The time
to cross this region is approximately 100 Myr which is
consistent with the hypothesis that the apparent break
is due to the inuence of RPS The onset of this break
however occurs much closer to the cluster center than is
usually expected  05R200 Treu et al 2003
The small region over which RPS has the strongest ef-
fect might explain the absence of the correlation between
M and SFR that is expected under the RPS scenario
The most massive galaxies which are best able to retain
their gas are preferentially found at R  01R200 These
galaxies therefore experience stronger ram pressure than
typical less massive cluster members and their ability
to retain their gas is cancelled by the increased stripping
they experience
64 TIR Luminosity Function
Another probe of the impact of environment on star
formation is the TIR luminosity function LF The TIR
LF is sensitive to the frequency of star formation in clus-
ters and the rapidity with which it is quenched this
provides a strong empirical constraint on the types of
processes that mediate the interaction between individ-
ual galaxies and the cluster environment For example
Bai et al 2009 found similar shapes  and L of the
TIR LFs in the galaxy clusters that they measure com-
pared to the eld galaxy TIR LF They argue that this
similarity requires truncation of star formation on short
timescales compared to the lifetime of star formation in
individual galaxies Such rapid transitions are inconsis-
tent with processes like gas starvation and galaxy harass-
To evaluate the conclusion that RPS dominates the
evolution of star formation in galaxy cluster members
we will examine the TIR LFs of the clusters in our main
cluster sample We construct the LF as described in 52
and the results appear in Figure 8 The main cluster sam-

the 5 clusters in the main sample Input galaxies are restricted to
MR  20 and R  04R200 The Coma cluster LF blue triangles
Bai et al 2009 is shown for reference The solid black lines on each
panel show the eld galaxy TIR LF of Perez-Gonzalez et al 2005
shifted to the redshift of the cluster and normalized to match the
observed LF above our nominal completeness limit of 21  1010L
vertical dashed line which is the approximate LT IR expected
for a normal spiral galaxy with MR  20 mag This indicates the
expected distribution of SFRs among eld galaxies that enter the
cluster The dashed lines mark the completeness limit imposed by
the requirement MR  20 Some variation between individual
clusters is apparent at the highest luminosities
ple contains only 5 clusters which prevents construction
of subsamples that have dierent masses and similar red-
shifts Therefore we cannot reliably identify eects that
are strongly dependent on cluster mass
The dashed vertical line in Figure 8 marks the ex-
pected LT IR of a galaxy with the Assef et al 2010 spi-
ral SED and MR  20 This marks the approximate
TIR completeness limit imposed by the requirement that
MR  20 We call this limit Lthresh
T IR  This limit is
representative only and Figure 8 includes many cluster
members that have MR  20 and LT IR  Lthresh
This is expected because cluster galaxies have lower
hsSF Ri than the eld galaxies used to construct the
In fact 65 of galaxies
Assef et al 2010 templates
with MR  20 mag and measurable  3 MIR emis-
sion are less luminous than Lthresh
T IR  This means that
Lthresh
is robust and the true limit is lower than the
nominal value established from the spiral galaxy tem-
plate To predict the true Lthresh
T IR  we would need a model
for the truncation of star formation in clusters which is
exactly what we want to measure To be conservative
we restrict our ts to use only bins more luminous than
Lthresh
T IR  Above this limit we can be condent that the
weights given by Eq 6 will correct to the full galaxy
population
Like Bai et al 2009 we nd that the individual clus-
ters in Figure 8 have luminosity functions that closely
resemble the eld galaxy LF at their respective redshifts
This agreement occurs despite the disagreement between
the eld galaxy LF and the combed cluster sample Fig-
ure 9 While it is possible that the eld galaxy LF at
the median redshift of the cluster provides a poor es-
Environmental Eects on SF
ies that fall in from the eld as Bai et al 2009 con-
clude then only galaxies that have recently become clus-
ter members will have measurable star formation and
the TIR LF of a cluster should have L and  similar
to the eld galaxy LF at the same redshift There-
fore we want to compare L to the eld galaxy LF
at the median redshift of the combined galaxy sample

galaxy LF evolves as L  1  zn where n  3207

Perez-Gonzalez et al 2005 studied the 12m LFs of
eld galaxies from z  0 to z  3 and found that the
eld galaxy LF at z  01 has L
12m  41 13 109L
and   123  007 We use the prescription of
Takeuchi et al 2005 to convert their L to a TIR lu-
T IR  23  1010L at z  01
minosity which yields L
We determine the eld galaxy LF at the median redshift
of the stacked cluster sample zmed  0211 with the re-
sults of Le Floch et al 2005 and t the normalization
of the LF to the observed cluster galaxy LF The result is
shown as the blue dashed line in Figure 9 The quality
of the t 2  47 is considerably poorer than the t
shown by the heavy black line 2  05 which uses 
from the Coma cluster and ts for L
T IR and  While
the absolute 2 values cannot be used to evaluate the
quality of the ts due to the presence of correlated errors
in adjacent bins the Coma-based LF improves the qual-
ity of the t by 2  42 with only 1 additional degree
of freedom
Bai et al 2009 found that the luminous ends of the
TIR LFs of the Coma cluster and A3266 have similar
shapes and that the L
T IR for these clusters are indistin-
guishable from the eld galaxy LF The similarity be-
tween the stacked cluster LF and the redshifted eld
galaxy LF for LT IR  4  1010L is consistent with
the conclusions of Bai et al 2009 They argue that the
similar LF shapes in clusters and in the eld suggests
that gas starvation is not a plausible mechanism to end
star formation among cluster member galaxies Because
gas starvation operates slowly  Gyr timescales they
conclude it should produce many galaxies in the tran-
sition phase between SFGs and passive evolution They
found no such transition population However the com-
bined cluster LF shown in Figure 9 displays a 4 decit of
galaxies with moderate SFRs SF R  5 M yr1 com-
pared to the expectation from the eld LF This largely
drives our conclusion that an unmodied eld galaxy LF
does not provide a good description of the SFG popu-
lation in the merged cluster sample The disagreement
between the eld and cluster galaxy LFs could indicate
the presence of a transition population
It is possible
that the discrepancy results instead from some selection
eect not accounted for in our completeness estimates
The most obvious culprit for such an eect is some resid-
ual dependence of spectroscopic member identication
on color that we have not been able to identify from the
As a test for radial gradients in the population of tran-
sition SFGs we binned the galaxies in the main clus-
ter sample into three radial bins with equal numbers of
galaxies The TIR LFs for the radial subsamples are
shown in Figure 10 The L
T IR increases slightly from
the innermost to outermost radial bins but this increase
is not statistically signicant This marginal decrease in

timate of L
T IR among galaxies that fall into clusters
any eects of preprocessing in the large-scale structure
around the cluster should appear in Figure 8 A better
explanation appears to be that the improved statistics
in the combined cluster sample illuminate a discrepancy
that is not visible in the individual clusters due to larger
observational uncertainties
At least some of the variation between the IR LFs ob-
served in dierent clusters may be caused by system-
atic uncertainties in the completeness corrections We
can only apply completeness corrections in regions of the
clusters where we have both spectra and MIR photom-
etry so azimuthal asymmetry may be important The
LF of the stacked cluster sample averages over several
selection regions so it is less subject to this uncertainty
We constructed the best-t Schechter functions to both
the Coma cluster and the stacked cluster shown in Figure
9 The Schechter function has the form
L 
Lcid20 L
Lcid21
eLL
where L gives the projected surface density of sources
at TIR luminosity L and  and L are the usual
Schechter function parameters We xed   141 in
the t to the cluster LF which is the best-t value for
the Coma LF Bai et al 2006 Le Floch et al 2005
suggest that the faint end of the LF cannot evolve much
with redshift for z  1 so the faint end of the LF in the
Coma cluster is likely to provide a good estimate of 
in all galaxy clusters The best t to the stacked main
sample has L  66  11  1010L

ters without substructure respectively
If we correct
hsSF Ri of A3128 to the mean redshift of the other clus-
ters z  0241 we nd hsSF Ri  1504
04 1011 yr1
This is still lower than the average of the clusters without
substructure at  999 signicance
The dierence between A3128 and the other clusters
might be a result of the structure in A3128 or A3128
might simply have an unusually low hsSF Ri for its red-
shift In the latter case the observed dierence would
be a result of cosmic variance We compared A3128 with
the 4 individual clusters without substructure and we
found that A3128 has higher redshift-corrected hsSF Ri
than MS1008 which is approximately 50 more mas-
sive than A3128 However the typical dispersion in
fSF among nearby clusters with   800 km s1 is
 01 dex Poggianti et al 2006 so to explain the ob-
served decit of hsSF Ri in A3128 as cosmic variance
would require a  3 excursion While cosmic variance
provides a marginally plausible explanation for the decit
of hsSF Ri in A3128 the presence of substructure ap-
pears to be the more likely cause If the observed dier-
ence arose from groups that have recently fallen into the
cluster the excess sSFR in clusters without substructure
would imply that the average group member is likely to
have experienced preprocessing This result may be ab-
sent from the partial correlation results Table 4 because
only  10 of cluster members have ever been part of a
large group Berrier et al 2009 and only former group
members that have been accreted more recently than the
e-folding timescale for star formation will show evidence
of preprocessing
The conclusions drawn from the measured SFRs of
cluster members and from the integrated cluster prop-
erties depend strongly on the methods used to identify
and correct for AGN In Paper I we noted that the IR
and X-ray AGN selection techniques identify quite dif-
ferent samples If we relied only on X-ray based AGN
selection as some authors do the MIR luminosity con-
tributed by unidentied AGN would lead to an overes-
timate in the integrated SFR of the cluster For exam-
ple in A1689 we would overestimate the total SFR by
20 Applied to all clusters simultaneously this alter-
native method of AGN correction results in an inferred
hsSF Ri  7215
13 1011 yr1 among the clusters with-
out measurable substructure but no measurable change
in A3128 In this example uncorrected AGN contamina-
tion would dominate the observed dierence in hsSF Ri
and we would over-estimate the impact of preprocessing
in the group environment
66 MIR Butcher-Oemler Eect
The relative importance of gas starvation and RPS
is also probed by the evolution in hSF Ri as a func-
tion of cosmic time The classic example of this is
the Butcher-Oemler eect Butcher  Oemler 1978
Haines et al 2009 constructed an analogous measure-
ment with SFRs measured via L24m among the
LoCuSS cluster galaxies They employed a SFR thresh-
old of 86 M yr1 and they found that fSF  1  zn
with n  5721

the LoCuSS clusters as a function of redshift The fSF
values for our clusters and for a higher redshift cluster
sample measured by Saintonge et al 2008 are super-

condence interval is given by the shaded region The three LFs
hint at an increase in L
T IR analogous to the increase in hSF RiSF G
seen in Figure 7 but this increase is not statistically signicant
T IR in the innermost radial bin is qualitatively similar
to the results of Bai et al 2009 who also examined the
radial dependence of the TIR LF with a very similar bin-
ning scheme However the fractional change in L
T IR in
the Coma cluster is much larger than observed in Figure
10 The increase in hSF RiSF G seen in Figure 7 in the
same radial bins does not appear to aect L
T IR This
indicates that the change in hSF RiSF G is driven by the
frequency of galaxies with SF R  3 M yr1
65 Substructure and Preprocessing
Von der Linden et al 2010 found a trend toward in-
creased hSF Ri at larger RR200 that extended out to
at least 2R200 They concluded that preprocessing in
groups contributes signicantly to the SFRdensity rela-
tion Our observations do not extend past R  04R200
so it is impossible to measure preprocessing directly but
A3128 shows signicant substructure so we can compare
it to the smooth clusters in the sample to probe how
the presence of substructure inuences SFRs in clusters
This allows us to indirectly test the impact of group scale
environments on SFGs because coherent substructures
in clusters should correspond to recently-accreted groups
Before we can compare the integrated SFRs in dif-
ferent clusters we must rst correct for the dierent
numbers of galaxies in each cluster The sSFR natu-
rally accounts for this variation and it is therefore a
better parameter to compare integrated SFRs between
clusters We employ a method analogous to Eq 8 to
calculate the hsSF Ri and compare A3128 which shows
signicant substructure to the other clusters in the main
sample We nd hsSF Ri  9011
12  1012 yr1 and
hsSF Ri  3102

Environmental Eects on SF
ble trend toward larger L
T IR farther out in the cluster
64 We also found evidence for a concentration of
massive galaxies near the cluster center 62
In this section we consider the results of 63-65 in
more detail and interpret them in the context of two com-
peting mechanisms to end star formation in cluster galax-
ies RPS and gas starvation 71 We also briey dis-
cuss the additional information that the Butcher-Oemler
Eect can provide about the impact of the cluster envi-
ronment on SFGs 72
71 Star Formation in Clusters
In 6 we examined several diagnostics for the impact
of the cluster environment on star formation These in-
clude partial correlation analysis hSF Ri and hsSF Ri
versus radius and an examination of TIR LFs The
partial correlation results informed much of our subse-
quent analysis One important result was the absence of
a correlation between SFR and 10 once we control for
RR200 This implies that interactions between individ-
ual galaxies have only a limited impact on star formation
in cluster members We conclude that the SFRs of clus-
ter members are controlled by hydrodynamic interactions
between galaxies and the ICM
There is disagreement in the literature concerning the
importance of dierent mechanisms to shut down star
formation in clusters For example Simard et al 2009
determined that evolution in cluster SFRs is controlled
by galaxy-galaxy interactions because the growth in the
fractions of early-type and passive galaxies track one
another very closely in their sample This contrasts
sharply with our results in 61 which suggest that in-
teractions with the ICM are the dominant factor Of
the hydrodynamic processes commonly considered eg
RPS and gas starvation only RPS has been directly
observed to work in nearby clusters Kenney et al 2004
Sivanandam et al 2010 We therefore ask whether our
observations are consistent with RPS alone or if an addi-
tional mechanism is required to explain the observations
Treu et al 2003 determined that RPS works eec-
tively for Milky Way-like galaxies in a cluster with
Mvir  8  1014M when R  05R200 Our sample
is restricted to projected R  04R200 and their clus-
ter mass is similar to the typical cluster in our sample
Mclust  5  1014 M so RPS should act eciently
on most galaxies in our sample Nevertheless some of
the obvious signatures of RPS do not appear We found
no residual correlation of SFR with M at xed RR200
which is contrary to the prediction that RPS should af-
fect low-mass galaxies more strongly Furthermore we
found in 64 that the TIR LF of cluster galaxies is sig-
nicantly better t by a Schechter function with variable
T IR and with the Coma clusters faint-end slope than
by a redshift-corrected eld galaxy LF This is inconsis-
tent with the simplest prediction of RPS which would
suggest that the SFG population in clusters should be
well-described by the eld galaxy LF Bai et al 2006
2009 To interpret this disagreement we need to know
whether it results from dierent faint-end slopes between
the cluster population and the eld dierent L
T IR or
some combination of the two This level of detail is
impossible given the completeness limit in the present
sample so the implications of the poor agreement be-
tween the cluster and eld SFG populations are ambigu-

imposed The 8 clusters in our sample shown as the
red triangles in Figure 11 are clearly consistent with
the Haines et al 2009 result within the uncertainties
However the t to the LoCuSS clusters systematically
overpredicts fSF in the Saintonge et al 2008 clusters
despite the lower SFR threshold 5 M yr1 used by
Saintonge et al 2008
In 65 we considered the impact of X-ray only
AGN identication on the inferred hsSF Ri This be-
comes a more important consideration at high-z because
the frequency of luminous AGNs increases dramatically
Martini et al 2009 Figure 11 includes two points for
each cluster in our sample One shows fSF with the IR
AGN selection included lled triangles and the other
shows fSF that we would measure if we only knew about
the X-ray selected AGNs open triangles The fSF in-
ferred from the X-ray only selection in AC114 diers by
16 from the result when the full AGN sample is consid-
ered This illustrates the contamination that X-ray only
AGN identication can introduce to integrated SFRs
This contamination becomes more severe and appears
in other clusters for SFR thresholds less than the fairly
high value employed by Haines et al 2009
7 DISCUSSION
In 61 and 63 we examined correlations between en-
vironment SFR and M We found a strong correlation
of SFR with RR200 and we found evidence for a tran-
sition population of low-SFR galaxies near the cluster
center We interpret this population as evidence that
galaxies in this region experience a rapid reduction in
SFRs that initiates their transition from SFGs to passive
galaxies This interpretation was supported by a possi-
Atlee et al
ous Finally the best-t power law to the SFRradius
relation is consistentwithin very large observational
uncertaintieswith the predictions of Book  Benson
2010
However we also found evidence that RPS contributes
signicantly to the decline of SFRs among cluster galax-
ies Figure 7 shows that the dependence of SFR on
RR200 is driven largely by a decline in fSF toward the
cluster center and only a small fraction of the depen-
dence is driven by decline in the SFRs of individual SFGs
This is more consistent with RPS than with gas starva-
tion Furthermore the residual decline in hSF RiSF G
with RR200 does not occur smoothly but appears to
set in rapidly at R  01R200 The crossing time for this
region  100 M yr is consistent with RPS as the origin
of the transition but the small size of this region com-
pared to the radius where RPS is theoretically expected
to be important 05 R200 is surprising This explana-
tion is also dicult to reconcile with the decline in fSF 
which we attribute to RPS across all radii
To interpret Figures 7 and 10 we must consider pro-
jection eects and the inuence of galaxy backsplash
Projection eects will cause some galaxies at intrinsically
large RR200 to appear at small radii when the cluster
is projected onto the plane of the sky If we assume an
R2 density prole for galaxies and fSF vs RR200 as
determined by von der Linden et al 2010 only  30
of SFGs with projected R  03R200 actually fall within
that region This represents an upper limit since the
von der Linden et al 2010 result also includes projec-
tion eects Therefore we cannot assume that SFGs at
small RR200 actually reside in the high density regions
where RPS is most important This suggests that SFGs
that physically reside inside 01R200 have their SFRs re-
duced more drastically than implied by Figure 7
Backsplash refers to galaxies on nearly radial orbits
that pass through the dense central region of the cluster
and return to large RR200 This eect can make radial
gradients like the ones shown in Figure 7 particularly
dicult to interpret because even galaxies presently at
large radii may have passed near the cluster center in
the past Gill et al 2005 use N-body simulations to
nd that 50 of galaxies between 1-2R200 are backsplash
galaxies and 90 of these have been inside 05R200 at
some point in the past Pimbblet 2011 use mixture
modeling with observations of real clusters from SDSS to
infer that 60  6 of galaxies at RR200  03 are part
of the backsplash population so they were even deeper
into the dense central region of the cluster at some point
in the past Galaxies on radial orbits in a cluster with
an R2 mass prole and a core radius of 005R200 spend
only 4 of their time inside 01R200 and only 32 of their
time inside 05R200 This model also implies that approx-
imately half of the galaxies in a cluster with an age of 8
Gyr have previously passed through the cluster center
As a result the dynamic nature of the cluster populations
smears the dependence of star formation on projected ra-
dius relative to the underlying three-dimensional trends
This suggests that the projected trends shown in Figure
7 are lower limits to the true three-dimensional trends
The eects of projection are potentially just as impor-
tant We adopt the simple mass prole described above
which implies that  40 of galaxies with projected
R  01R200 actually reside outside 01R200 However
the trend in fSF versus radius Figure 7 implies that at
least 67 of SFGs that appear with R  01R200 in pro-
jection are likely to have three-dimensional radii outside
this limit and 20 of SFGs with projected R  04R200
will lie outside this radius The steep dependence of fSF
on radius therefore works to mitigate any radial trends
among the SFG population which would lead to the
small dependence of hSF RiSF G on RR200 This sug-
gests that the sharp drop in hSF RiSF G at projected ra-
dius 01R200 would be stronger if measured relative to
physical radius
An ideal way to account for both projection and back-
splash in our observables is to compare our results to
models that include these eects This approach allows
more reliable conclusions than simple ad hoc arguments
Book  Benson 2010 developed a model for the re-
moval of hot gas from galaxies by the ICM which is the
physical mechanism that drives gas starvation Their
shocks model predicts that galaxies that experience
this process should show SF R  RR20006 between
01-04R200 their Figure 3 This is consistent with
our results in 63 hSF Ri  RR2001307 How-
ever the model yields overall poor agreement with the
data even after we t the normalization of the model
to best match the observations This contrasts with the
results of Book  Benson 2010 who found that their
model agrees well with the SFRradius relation measured
among the CNOC clusters Balogh et al 2000 The
resolution of this conict will require additional obser-
vations and more sophisticated theoretical models that
provide predictions for competing processes
The large statistical uncertainties on the measured
SFR versus RR200 preclude detailed comparisons be-
tween our observations and a model for either RPS or
gas starvation so we must rely on qualitative arguments
Figure 9 demonstrates that the eld galaxy TIR LF at
the median redshift of the combined cluster galaxy sam-
ple provides a poor match to the observed TIR LF and
this discrepancy is most pronounced among galaxies with
the lowest SFRs The bottom panel of Figure 7 also
shows a sudden decrease in the SFRs of SFGs with pro-
jected radii R  01R200 The crossing time for this
region is  200 Myr which suggests that RPS is respon-
sible for this reduction However only 5 of SFGs in
the cluster have R  01R200 so this reduction in the
SFRs of SFGs near the cluster center cannot account for
the discrepancy between the TIR LFs of cluster and eld
galaxies There must also be an eect at larger radii that
is not apparent in the present sample The entire sample
has R  05R200 so either RPS or gas starvation could
plausibly cause the disagreement
In contrast to our results Bai et al 2009 found that
the TIR LFs of many clusters are consistent with one
another and with the eld LF They inferred that cluster
galaxies only rarely occupy a transition phase between
SFRs characteristic of eld galaxies and complete pas-
sivity From this they determined that star formation
in cluster galaxies must be truncated on short timescales
compared to the lifetime of the cluster Both we and
Bai et al 2006 nd  1 variations in the shape of
the TIR LF in dierent RR200 bins The observed de-
creases in L
T IR while not statistically signicant are
consistent with the decline in hSF RiSF G for R  01R200
Environmental Eects on SF
Figure 7 The latter result indicates that the high
ICM density near cluster centers reduces SFRs in indi-
vidual SFGs The smooth decline in fSF as a function
of RR200 suggests that this process eventually results
in the end of star formation in these galaxies Projection
eects and backsplash will both inuence the observed
trends Projection would cause us to mistake galaxies at
large RR200 for galaxies near the cluster center while
backsplash would move galaxies that had been processed
near the cluster center back to the outskirts of the cluster
Both eects would cause the projected trends to appear
weaker than the true three-dimensional variations in the
cluster This suggests that the observed radial variations
are real and the trends with projected radius likely un-
derestimate the intrinsic three-dimensional trends
We nd lower hSF RiSF G inside 01R200 compared to
outside this radius We also see hints of this change
in the lower L
T IR near the cluster center compared to
further out The variation in the properties of SFGs
implied by these measurements indicates a substantial
change in the SFGs very close to the cluster center The
crossing time for the sphere with radius 01R200 is less
than 200 Myr which strongly favors RPS as an explana-
tion However we also see indications for a decit in the
number of low-SFR cluster galaxies relative to the eld
population Because only  5 of SFGs have projected
R  01R200 galaxies outside 01R200 must dominate the
under-abundance of galaxies with SF R  3M yr1
We can determine whether RPS or gas starvation are
more likely to be responsible for the decit from the time
required to make the transition We nd that 66 of
SFGs with MR  20 mag have LT IR  Lthresh
T IR  where
Lthresh
T IR is the luminosity expected for a typical eld spi-
ral with MR  20 If 50 of eld SFGs with the same
MR distribution had LT IR  Lthresh
T IR  then 16 of clus-
ter SFGs would be in transition Combined with the
gas consumption timescale of a typical spiral galaxy 24
Gyr Bigiel et al 2011 this implies a transition time
of  400 Myr This timescale is approximately twice
the dynamical time of an ordinary spiral galaxy This
timescale favors RPS as the dominant mechanism among
the full cluster sample because RPS implies that galax-
ies should remain in a transition phase for approximately
their dynamical time while the cold ISM is stripped
However the assumption that 50 of eld SFGs in an
MR-matched sample would have LT IR  Lthresh
T IR is arbi-
trary A comparison of the SFRMR relations in clusters
and in the eld is required to measure the transition time
more precisely
If star formation in most cluster galaxies ends as a
result of RPS post-starburst galaxies should be more
frequent in clusters than in the eld This is a robust
prediction of any scenario that results in a rapid transi-
tion of SFGs to passive evolution Galaxies with KA
spectra which are usually associated with post-starburst
populations should remain visible for  100 Myr to
1 Gyr This is short compared to the cluster crossing
time so a large population of KA galaxies relative to
SFGs would be strong evidence that RPS plays an impor-
tant role Instead Yan et al 2009 report that galaxies
with KA spectra are less common in overdense envi-
ronments like clusters than in the eld at z  01 They
suggest that KA galaxies appear at constant absolute
density and that this density corresponds to the group
scale at z  0 Dressler et al 1999 instead found that
the fraction of KA galaxies is much higher in clusters
than in the eld and von der Linden et al 2010 found
no dependence of the ratio of NKANSF on RR200
The dierent methods used by these authors to select
their KA samplesDressler et al 1999 rely on Oii
to exclude SFGs while Yan et al 2009 use H and
von der Linden et al 2010 select galaxies with excess
Balmer line absorption from their principal component
analysismay account for the apparent contradictions
in these observational results
Groups that have recently fallen into a cluster might
appear as an excess in the substructure parameter
Dressler  Shectman 1988 In our sample only A3125
has a mass comparable to galaxy groups and we have
not considered that cluster in our analysis Therefore
we cannot directly constrain the mechanism that drives
SFR evolution in group members However we nd that
hsSF Ri is higher among clusters with no substructure
than in A3128 which is the only member of our main
sample with signicant substructure This could indi-
cate that galaxies that have recently been part of groups
have experienced preprocessing but it could also arise
from cosmic variance In a recent study of SDSS galaxy
clusters von der Linden et al 2010 found a trend of
SFR with radius that extended to 2R200 They con-
cluded that preprocessing of galaxies before they become
cluster members is likely to contribute signicantly to
the SFRradius relation Additional observations are re-
quired to determine if galaxy groups are responsible for
the preprocessing or if other processes are required
72 Evolution
In 66 we suggested that the evolution of star forma-
tion in clusters is sensitive to the mechanisms responsi-
ble for the appearance of the z  0 SFRdensity relation
In particular the rate of evolution of fSF is sensitive
to the operation of the cluster environment on recently
accreted eld galaxies Figure 11 shows the fraction of
SFGs in clusters as a function of redshift since z  08 for
the clusters in our sample red  compared to the samples
of Saintonge et al 2008 and Haines et al 2009
We use measurements of fSF versus z to estimate the
time required for fSF in clusters to decline by a fac-
tor of e compared to coeval eld galaxies The best-t
to the Haines et al 2009 galaxies cid0fSF  1  zm
18cid1 is shown as the black line in Figure
T IRz  1  zn where n  3207
m  5721
11 and it agrees well with the clusters in our sample
Le Floch et al 2005 report that the eld galaxy LF
evolves as L
02 Ap-
proximately 70 of cluster member galaxies at z  0
never had a massive companion before they entered the
cluster environment Berrier et al 2009 so we can as-
sume that galaxies that fall into the cluster have the same
LF as eld galaxies The threshold we use to identify
SFGs SF R  86 M yr1 is larger than the SFR that
corresponds to L
T IR 4 M yr1 so we assume that
fSF among eld galaxies has the same redshift depen-
dence as L
T IR With this assumption we can measure
the relative change in fSF as a function of redshift and
determine how the cluster environment induces SFGs to
turn passive The ratio of fSFclust to fSFf ield has un-
Atlee et al
dergone approximately 17  12 e-foldings since z  1
The elapsed time over this redshift interval is 77 Gyr so
the e-folding time for fSFclustfSFf ield is 46106
18 Gyr
The e-folding time of fSF does not correspond directly
to the truncation time for star formation in individual
cluster members New SFGs constantly fall into the clus-
ter from the eld and this results in a longer timescale for
fSFclustfsff ield to decline than for SFRs to decline in
individual galaxies The rate at which SFGs fall into the
cluster combines with the timescale for the conversion of
individual SFGs to passive evolution to determine how
rapidly fSFclustfSFf ield changes The timescale for
this change is long compared to the gas exhaustion time
in typical spiral galaxies 24 Gyr Bigiel et al 2011 but
this does not necessarily indicate that the timescale for
the evolution of individual SFGs is similarly long If the
timescale for evolution of individual SFGs is indeed long
it would favor gas starvation over RPS as the primary
mechanism to end star formation in cluster galaxies
In addition to the degeneracy between changes in
rates of infall and the timescale for individual SFGs
to stop forming stars
the measured timescale for
fSFclustfSFf ield to evolve includes signicant obser-
vational uncertainty The Haines et al 2009 best-
t overpredicts fSF among the high-z clusters despite
the higher SFR threshold employed by Haines et al
2009 so it underestimates the timescale over which
fSFclustfSFf ield evolves Additional observations are
required to correct this bias A measurement of fSF
versus z with a longer redshift baseline and consistent
identication of SFGs will appear in our next paper
8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have used visible to MIR observations of 8 low-
z galaxy clusters to constrain the impact of the cluster
environment on star formation We examined the rela-
tionship between star formation and environment among
cluster members and found a strong correlation with
hSF Ri  RR2001307 and this simple power law
provides a good match to the data Book  Benson
2010 model the impact of gas starvation on star for-
mation Their model is marginally consistent with the
power-law that best ts the observed SFRradius rela-
tion but it is a poor t to the data themselves The
hSF RiRR200 relation is dominated by a decline in
the fraction of SFGs toward the cluster center but
we also nd lower hSF Ri among SFGs with projected
R  01R200 The dominance of the decline in fSF and
the short crossing time of a sphere with radius 01R200
both suggest that RPS contributes signicantly to the
observed trend in SFR with RR200 The TIR LFs hint
at a shift toward lower L
T IR near the cluster center
which is consistent with the observed decline in hSF Ri
but this shift is not statistically signicant Projections
eects and backsplash both work to weaken the observed
trends relative to the intrinsic variation in three dimen-
sions which can hide the steep gradients that would be
expected from RPS
We also examined the relationship between RR200
and stellar mass in cluster galaxies We found that
galaxies with R  01R200 show larger hMi than galax-
ies farther out in the cluster even after we have elim-
inated BCGs from our sample This excess is signi-
cant at  35 and projection eects are also expected
to weaken the observed trend relative to the intrinsic
three-dimensional variation so we conclude that it is ro-
bust Von der Linden et al 2010 found no such excess
once they had removed BCGs so our result conicts with
theirs This dierence may result from the SDSS ber
collisions Our sample is limited to galaxies more lumi-
nous than the SDSS r-band magnitude limit at the me-
dian redshift of the von der Linden et al 2010 cluster
sample so our sample is on average more massive than
theirs However the timescale for dynamical friction to
aect cluster members is much longer than the Hubble
time This suggests that cluster galaxies undergo mass
segregation via virial relaxation analogous to the mass
segregation exhibited by some Galactic globular clusters
We measured the fractions of SFGs in our cluster sam-
ple as a function of redshift and we found that these
fractions are consistent with the measurements made by
Haines et al 2009 for the LoCuSS clusters However
incomplete AGN subtraction can introduce signicant
contamination to the integrated star formation in galaxy
clusters For example we found that eliminating only
X-ray AGNs from the sample prior to calculation of fSF
results in a  1 excess in AC 114 in Figure 11 The con-
sequences are both more signicant and more widespread
for lower SFR thresholds This can bias measurements
of star formation as a function of redshift since the AGN
contribution is expected to be more signicant at higher
redshift Martini et al 2009 With a long enough red-
shift baseline evolution in fSF with cosmic time can
probe the timescale for the end of star formation in clus-
ter galaxies Present observations favor gas starvation
over RPS but these include important systematic un-
certainties
On balance our measurements are most consistent
with RPS as the primary mechanism to reduce star for-
mation in cluster galaxies The SFRradius relation
agrees better with the predictions of RPS than with gas
starvation over the range of radii that we study This
supports the conclusions of Bai et al 2009 who stud-
ied star formation in clusters over a similar range of
radii and determined that RPS dominates the reduction
of SFR among cluster galaxies The observation that
SFR does not correlate strongly with M among SFGs
in clusters can be explained by the concentration of mas-
sive galaxies near the cluster center where RPS oper-
ates most eciently Furthermore Bai et al 2009 also
found that the luminous end of the TIR LF does not
vary signicantly between z  0 clusters and we sim-
ilarly nd that the redshift-appropriate eld galaxy LF
provides a good match to the observed TIR LF in each
cluster While this is also consistent with RPS as the
primary mechanism to end star formation among cluster
galaxies the disagreement between the eld galaxy LF
and the stacked cluster sample suggests that there are
small deviations between the individual clusters and the
eld galaxy LF that we overlook due to limited precision
in the measured LFs Such deviations would be more
consistent with gas starvation than with RPS Addition-
ally the long timescale we infer for the evolution of fSF
conicts with the conclusion that RPS ends star forma-
tion among cluster members and is more consistent with
gas starvation This evidence agrees with the conclu-
sions of Verdugo et al 2008 and von der Linden et al
2010 who found independent evidence in favor of gas
Environmental Eects on SF
starvation A measurement of the rate of change in fSF
as a function of redshift can provide an additional line of
evidence to help resolve this disagreement Present re-
sults favor a long timescale but these include signicant

APPENDIX
ASYMMETRIC DISTRIBUTION FUNCTION
In order to apply the method described in 5 to construct a luminosity function we must smoothly distribute the
weight of a galaxy across the specied luminosity bins The method described in 51 to calculate LT IR produces
asymmetric uncertainties LT IR  u
l  so we need an asymmetric probability density function PDF to distribute
weights correctly This PDF must reduce to the Normal distribution in the case when the upper and lower luminosity
uncertainties are equal ie Gaussian errors Here we describe a piecewise smooth function that satises these
requirements
First we dene an eective dispersion e  lu where u and l are the upper and lower uncertainties on LT IR
respectively We then dene an alternative dispersion L which describes the instantaneous shape of the PDF at
a luminosity L
IF L    l

where  is the best estimate LT IR u and l are the upper and lower uncertainties on  respectively L smoothly
connects the low-L and high-L tails of the desired distribution function Given L we can calculate the probability
density for a galaxy with measured luminosity  at L This probability density is given by
f L  u l 
2 L
eL222L
where L is given by Eq A1
The PDF described by Eqs A1 and A2 approaches Gaussian at the high- and low-L extremes with dispersions u
and l respectively It also smoothly connects these two limiting cases integrates to unity and has dispersion equal
to the geometric mean of l and u at the nominal luminosity It therefore gives a PDF for the luminosity of a given
galaxy that satises our requirements and that is consistent with the available information about LT IR

Note  Column 1 gives the cluster name Column 2 gives the median radius
scaled to the virial radius of the cluster of galaxies that go into the bin Columns
3 and 5 give the median observed frame uxes in the 8m and 24m channels
respectively of the model SEDs that make up each bin Fluxes are calculated by
integrating model SEDs with random combinations of the Assef et al 2010 star
forming templates across the published instrument response functions If the SFR
inferred from the rest frame luminosities in the model SEDs are outside the range
102  SF R1 M yr1  102 the associated uxes are not included in the sam-
ple Because the Assef et al 2010 templates are not constructed to have identical
SFRs in the 8m and 24m channels this sometimes means that an SED with a
valid SFR in one channel will not appear in another When a ux bin is occupied
in one channel and not in another the empty channel has f  0 and C  1
This is the case for the rst ux bin in AC114 Columns 4 and 6 give the MIR
completeness C as dened in 42 The complete table is available from the elec-
tronic edition of the journal A sample is shown here for guidance regarding form
