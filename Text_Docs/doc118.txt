ABSTRACT
AimsWe investigate the dependence of several galaxy properties on the environment and cluster identication techniques
Methods We select clusters of galaxies from two catalogues based on the SDSS the ROSAT-SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey which
is an X-ray selected cluster sample and the MaxBCG Catalogue in which clusters are optically selected Based on a volume limited
sample of galaxies drawn from the spectroscopic DR5 SDSS we constructed sub-samples of clusters of galaxies with more than ten
members Scaling relations as well as segregation of galaxy properties as a function of the normalized clustocentric radii are analyzed
The properties of galaxies in clusters are compared with those of eld galaxies
Results Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters show similar size-luminosity relations At equal luminosity late type
galaxies in the eld have sizes smaller than cluster galaxies of the same morphological type
The Faber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies in clusters is also the same for X-ray selected and MaxBCG clusters We found
clear dierences between the dynamical properties of galaxies in clusters the brightest cluster galaxies BCGs and eld galaxies
Using several criteria to classify galaxies into morphological types we reproduce the well know morphological segregation The
correlation is up to rr200  1 For the whole range of clustocentric distances X-ray selected clusters present a higher fraction of
early type galaxies than MaxBCG clusters We also found that bright galaxies preferentially inhabit the cluster centers Median sizes
of galaxies such as the radius that enclose 50 of Petrosian ux r50 present a behaviour that also depends on the cluster selection
criteria For galaxies in X-ray selected clusters median values of r50 decrease as rr200 goes to zero whereas the opposite is observed
for galaxies in the MaxBCG clusters These dierent behaviours are mainly due to early type galaxies
The results are discussed in terms of the dierent processes that aect the evolution of galaxies in dierent environments
Key words galaxies clusters  galaxies fundamental parameters
1 Introduction
It is well known that galaxies show a wide range of mor-
phologies which can be appreciated in their properties such
as colour luminosity size star formation histories etc which
imply that galaxies form and evolve through dierent mech-
anisms There have been many studies about
the distribu-
tion of galaxies with respect to their properties For exam-
ple the luminosity function has been measured from various
surveys of galaxies and clusters of galaxies and it is found
to be well described by the Schechter function Schechter
1976 Loveday et al 1992 Folkes et al 1999 Madgwick et al
2002 Cross et al 2004 the morphological types of galaxies
are found to be correlated with the environment clusters of
galaxies being the best example Dressler 1980 Dressler et al
1997 Domnguez et al 2001 Coenda et al 2006 It is also well
known that dierent galaxy properties are correlated to each
other Galaxy sizes are correlated with the luminosity and mor-
phological type Andredakis et al 1995 Mollenho  Heidt

2006 and have a distribution that may be described by a
log-normal function Syer et al 1999 de Jong  Lacey 2000
Shen et al 2003 Ferguson et al 2004 In order to constrain the
galaxy formation models and the study of galaxy properties and
their dependence on environment we concentrate our studies on
several scaling relations and galaxy segregation
Sandage  Perelmuter
color-magnitude
There are dierent scaling relations between photometric
and structural parameters of galaxies resulting in well known
relations One of the most established empirical scaling relations
of disk galaxies is the Tully-Fisher relation Tully  Fisher
1977 which consist of a correlation between luminosity and
rotational velocity The analogous relation for spheroidal galax-
ies is the correlation between the velocity dispersion of bulges
and luminosity known as the Faber-Jackson relation L  
Faber  Jackson 1976 Other scaling relations for spheroidal
galaxies
Sandage  Visvanathan
1978ab color-velocity dispersion Bernardi et al 2005
radius-luminosity
Kormendy relation which is a correlation between radius and
surface brightness Kormendy 1977 Some of these properties
have been combined to dene the so-called fundamental plane
that relates the velocity dispersion the eective radius and
the luminosity Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987
Bernardi et al 2003 These empirical relations are closely re-
lated to the physical processes involved in the galaxy formation
scenario and therefore are a fundamental tool to understand
the formation and evolution of galaxies These relations could
depend on the environment where galaxies form and evolve
introducing departures from scatter in the dierent scaling
relations Several authors have investigated the scaling relations
of galaxies in clusters Ziegler et al 1999 La Barbera et al

found that brightest cluster galaxies BCG have
a higher fraction of dark matter and consequently larger
radii and higher velocity dispersions that non-BCG galaxies
Malumuth  Kirshner 1981 1985 Oegerle  Hoessel 1991
and more recently Bernardi et al 2007 found that BCG have
smaller  than the rest of the cluster members Bernardi et al
2007 also analyze the dynamical mass Mdyn  r502 and
found that BCGs show a steeper relation than non-BCG galax-
ies The majority of the works mentioned above do not make a
suitable comparison with eld galaxies making it very dicult
ti perform a complete comparison of the scaling relations
of galaxies as a function of the environment More recently
Weinmann et al 2009 and Guo et al 2009 analyzed samples
of galaxies in groups and found that at xed stellar mass the
sizes of central and satellite early type galaxies are similar
while Bernardi 2009 analyzing galaxies in clusters reported
a dierence at high luminositiesstellar masses between central
and satellite galaxies
It is well known that dierent types of galaxies show dif-
ferent spatial distributions Oemler 1974 Melnick  Sargent
1977 Dressler 1980 These dierences can be estimated mea-
suring the radial dependence of the galaxy properties as a func-
tion of the clutocentric distance The segregation of galaxies
in clusters has been quantied splitting galaxies according to
dierent properties with the morphology the property that has
been most extensively studied see for instance Dressler 1980
Whitmore et al 1993 Domnguez et al 2001 Biviano et al
2002 Driver et al 2003 Coenda et al 2006 Goto et al
2002 found that the morphological segregation tends to dis-
appear for clustocentric distances larger than the virial radius
Recently Martnez et al 2008 found that gr color is the prop-
erty of galaxies that best predict the normalized clutocentric dis-
tance of galaxies among a set of galaxy properties Similarly
Skibba et al 2008 used the galaxy sample of visual classi-
ed morphologies and found that much of the morphology-
density relation is due to the relation between colour and den-
sity The works that have studied the segregation in luminos-
ity present some contradictory results Rood  Turnrose 1968
Yepes et al 1991 Lobo et al 1997 Kashikawa et al 1998
Coenda et al 2006 found results consistent with a segregation
in luminosity Nevertheless Noonan 1961 Bahcall 1973 and
more recently Pracy et al 2005 found results consistent with a
lack of segregation in luminosity The segregation of other prop-
erties like color star formation rate gas content or structural pa-
rameters have been much less studied
The identication of clusters of galaxies is a complex process
whose outcome depends on the selection criteria Popesso et al
2004 compiled X-ray clusters in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
SDSS Using the same survey Koester et al 2007b applied
a maxBCG algorithm to identied clusters This technique is
based on the color-magnitude relation of the early type galax-
ies and the properties of the BCGs Because we are interested
in comparing the galaxy properties of clusters selected with
dierent criteria the same analysis will be performed on sub-
samples of the catalogues compiled by Popesso et al 2004 and
Koester et al 2007b
This paper is organised as follows in section 2 we describe
the cluster and galaxy samples in section 3 we investigate sev-
eral galaxy scaling relations in section 4 we analyze the galaxy
segregation We summarise and discuss our results in section 5
2 The sample
21 Theclustersample
We use two catalogues of clusters of galaxies based on the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS York et al 2000 the ROSAT-
SDSS Galaxy Cluster Survey of Popesso et al 2004 hereafter
P04 which is a X-ray selected cluster sample and the MaxBGC
Catalogue of Koester et al 2007b hereafter K07 which is an
optically selected cluster sample
The ROSAT-SDSS catalogue of Popesso et al 2004 com-
prises 114 galaxy clusters detected in the ROSAT All Sky
Survey RASS lying in the area surveyed by the SDSS by
February 2003 This X-ray-selected catalogue includes clusters
with masses from 10125M to 1015M in the redshift range
0002  z  045 This catalogue provides X-ray properties
of the clusters derived from the ROSAT data parameters of the
galaxy luminosity function and the luminosity of each cluster
computed from SDSS data and the radial distribution of the pro-
jected galaxy density around clusters Since the X-ray observa-
tions provide a robust method for identifying clusters these clus-
ters constitute a reliable source of information to study galaxy
properties and their correlation with the environment
The optical MaxBGC catalogue provides sky locations pho-
tometric redshift estimates and richness for 13823 clusters
Details of the selection algorithm and catalogue properties are
published in Koester et al 2007ab The MaxBGC selection re-
lies on the observation that the galaxy population of rich clus-
ters is dominated by bright red galaxies tightly clustered in
colour the ES0 ridgeline Since these galaxies are old pas-
sively evolving stellar populations their g  r colours closely
reect their redshifts The brightest red galaxy typically located
at the peak of the galaxy density denes the cluster centre The
K07 catalogue comprises galaxy clusters with velocity disper-
sions   400km s1 and redshifts 01  z  03 Each of these
clusters contains between 10 and 190 ES0 ridgeline galaxies
brighter than 04L i-band within a scaled radius r200 dened
as the mean density of 200 times the mean density of the uni-
verse SDSS spectroscopic redshifts are available for at least the
brightest galaxy in 39 of the clusters The sample is up to 85
complete for clusters with masses  1014M
The sub-samples from P04 and K07 considered in this paper
comprise galaxy clusters in the redshift range 005  z  014
The upper limit was taken in order to have a volume limited
sample of galaxies with an adequate balance between the num-
ber of clusters the range in absolute magnitude and the num-
ber of cluster members For K07 clusters we applied a re-
striction in the richness selecting clusters with Ngal  20 in
order to have cluster masses comparable to those in the P04
sample The sub-samples are labeled as C-P04 and C-K07 re-
spectively To select cluster members and estimate the phys-
ical properties of clusters we use the Main Galaxy Sample
MGS Strauss et al 2002 of the Fifth Data Release DR5 of
SDSS Adelman-McCarthy et al 2007 that is complete down
to a Petrosian 1976 magnitude r  1777 At this point our
sub-samples comprise 54 X-ray galaxy clusters from the P04
sample and 612 from the K07 sample We show in panel a of

clusters for which the fof redshift value lay outside the redshift
range we consider in this paper
Once the members of each cluster are selected we com-
pute cluster physical properties we are interested in We com-
pute the line-of-sight velocity dispersion  the virial radius and
mass and the r200 The line-of-sight velocity dispersion  is es-
timated using methods described by Beers et al 1990 The bi-
weight estimator was applied to clusters with  15 members
whereas the gapper estimator was applied to poorer clusters The
radius r200 was computed using the approximation provided by
Carlberg et al 1997 In a rst step we determined these pa-
rameters using all the cluster members within a 3Mpc projected
distance After this step we recalculated  and r200 using only
galaxies located inside r200 Virial radis and masses were com-
puted following Merchan  Zandivarez 2005 The mean val-
ues of these parameters are shown in Table 1 where it can be
seen that the sample C-P04 includes on average clusters slightly
more massive and larger than the sample C-K07 Figure 2 shows
the distributions of cluster physical properties of our samples
The distributions of the main properties of the 20 coincident
clusters are similar to those of the parent samples
Through visual inspection we classied clusters based on
their substructure We only consider in our analysis sub-samples
of regular clusters that we label C-P04-I and C-K07-I and we
exclude systems that have two or more close substructures of
similar size in the plane of the sky andor in the redshift distribu-
tion In order to compute the physical properties in a reasonable
way clusters with fewer than 10 galaxy members within r200 are
excluded Girardi et al 1993 Our nal galaxy cluster sample
comprises 49 clusters from C-P04-I and 209 from C-K07-I Our
sample of MaxBCG clusters is an order of magnitude smaller
than the sample considered by Bernardi 2009 also based on
the Koester et al 2007a catalogue This dierence is mainly
due to our restriction to select clusters with at least ten spec-
troscopic members in the redshift range 005  z  014 The
sample of Bernardi 2009 includes clusters with redshift up to
03 and has on average fewer than one spectroscopic early-type
satellite galaxy per cluster
22 Thegalaxysample
In order to avoid the use of weights and since we are inter-
ested in bright galaxies we have constructed a volume lim-
ited samples instead of a ux limited sample Taking into ac-
count the depth of our sample z  014 and the apparent
magnitude limit of the Main Galaxy Sample of the SDSS our
sample of galaxies only includes objects with M01r  213
The C-P04-I sample comprises 786 galaxies while the C-K07-
I sample has 3041 galaxies Figure 3 shows the redshift distri-
butions of galaxies of our samples C-P04-I clusters with the
grey line and C-K07-I sample with the black line Galaxy magni-
tudes used throughout this paper have been corrected for galac-
tic extinction following Schlegel et al 1998 absolute magni-
tudes have been computed assuming 0  03   07 and
H0  70 h km s1 Mpc1 and Kcorrected using the method of

shift distribution of the K07 galaxy clusters black solid line the

the selected clusters C-P04 grey line and C-K07 black line
pick clusters that are included in both of them If the projected
distance between 2 clusters each belonging to a dierent cata-
logue is  1Mpc we consider that they are the same cluster
We found 20 coincidences in these cases the clusters are only
included in the X-ray sub-sample C-P04
In order to compute cluster properties such as velocity dis-
persion we rst identied the cluster members We use SDSS
galaxies from the MGS within a projected radius of 3Mpc
centred on the quoted cluster coordinates From these galax-
ies we identify cluster members in two steps First we use the
friends-of-friends fof  algorithm developed by Huchra  Geller
1982 with the percolation linking length values according to
Daz et al 2005 As a result we get for each eld a list of sub-
structures with at least 10 members identied by fof The second
step consists of eyeball examination of the structures detected
by fof a comparison between them and the listed cluster posi-
tion and redshift to determine which coordinates and redshift t
better the observed galaxy over-density From the redshift dis-
tribution of galaxies within cz  czcluster  3000km s1 we de-
termine the line-of-sight extension of each cluster ie a maxi-
mum and a minimum redshift for the cluster We then consider as
cluster members all galaxies in the eld that are within that red-
shift range The Daz et al 2005 technique includes an iterative
method that provides precise dynamical centres of the clusters
When these centres dier from those computed by Koester et al
2007a we adopted the fof values We found that for  40
for the clusters the angular position given by the fof is dier-
ent from the original value whereas for  17 of the clusters
the redshift derived from the fof algorithm is a better match to
the observed galaxy redshift distribution than those quoted in the
original catalogues Finally we excluded from our sample those

lated galaxies They found a dierence between the input magni-
tude and the model magnitude returned by the SDSS photomet-
ric pipeline as a function of magnitude Their results are con-
sistent with a separate analysis performed by Hyde  Bernardi
2009 Finally we have estimated the rest-frame radius r50 in
r-band interpolating the observed radii in the adjacent i-band as
in Hyde  Bernardi 2009
Since the aim of this work is to analyze scaling relations
and segregation of dierent types of galaxies in clusters and its
comparison with eld galaxies we adopt several criteria to clas-
sify galaxies Shimasaku et al 2001 found that the concentra-
tion index shows a strong correlation with morphological type
These authors conclude that C is perhaps the best parameter to
classify the morphology of galaxies They also found that galax-
ies with R50  2 show a weaker correlation between C and
the morphological type To separate galaxies into early and late
types we use the rband concentration index dened as the ra-
tio between the radii that enclose 90 and 50 of the Petrosian
ux C  r90r50 Typically early-type galaxies have C  25
while for late-types C  25 Strateva et al 2001 We also use
the color to discriminate between early and late type galaxies
The corresponding threshold is 01g  r  08  003Mr  20
see Blanton  Berlind 2007 Other indicator of galaxy type is
the mono-parametric spectral classication based on the eigen-
template expansion of galaxys spectrum eclass This param-
eter ranges from about 035 for early-type galaxies to 05
for late-type galaxies Yip et al 2004 the separation is set at
eclass  01 Finally we use the Sersic index n taken from
Blanton et al 2005a The distribution of n shows a bimodal
distribution see for instance Ball et al 2008 and Driver et al
2006 The n separation is set at 25 the value that divides
in equal parts the two distributions and corresponds to objects
with approximately equal bulge and disk components In gure
4 we show the distributions of galaxy parameters We can see
that clusters of the C-P04-I sample on average slightly more
massive than C-K07-I have a higher fraction of red galaxies
than those taken from the C-K07-I sample 89 and 85 re-
spectively
We are also interested in the study of the brightest cluster
galaxies and the comparison with early-type galaxies in both
clusters and in the eld We identify the spectroscopic brightest
cluster galaxy BCGs in our sample The BCGs in not neces-
sarily the true BCG due to the following reasons i As a con-
sequence of the nite ber size of the SDSS spectrograph any
two bers on the same plate need to be spaced at least 55 apart
In the case of a ber collision objects are selected at random ii
The MSG is limited at the bright end by the ber magnitude lim-
its r  145 to avoid saturation and excessive cross-talk in the
spectrograph These two eects together cause the spectroscopic
sample to become incomplete
In gure 5 we show the distributions of BCGs parameters
We nd that BCGs are larger and have lower surface brightness
that non-BCGs in agreement with von der Linden et al 2007
In addition BCGs have higher velocity dispersion than non-
BCGs In general we nd that BCGs have colors concentra-
tion and eclass parameters typical of normal early-type galaxies
Despite that BCGs are usually in the centre of the cluster poten-
tial well we nd that the 25 have rr200  05 Nevertheless it
is probable that a fraction of these BCGs with large rr200 are not
the actual BCG It is also possible that some of the cluster cen-
tres are wrong Finally we do not nd dierences between the
mean properties of BCGs in the C-P04-I and C-K07-I samples
To perform a suitable comparisson between cluster and eld
we construct a set of comparison samples These were drawn

grey lines show the C-P04-I sample while the dashed histograms
correspond to the C-K07-I sample
Blanton et al 2003 KCORRECT version 41 All magnitudes
are in the AB system
Among the available data for each object in the MGS we
have selected for our analyses parameters that are related to dif-
ferent physical properties of galaxies luminosity star formation
rate light distribution inside the galaxies and the dominant stel-
lar populations In particular the galaxy parameters we have fo-
cused our study on are the Petrosian rband absolute magni-
tude M01r and the radius that encloses 50 of the Petrosian ux
r50 We have chosen Petrosian quantities that are not corrected
for the eects of seeing In order to reduce the eect of the PS
on galaxy sizes we excluded galaxies with r50  2 ie 05
greater than the average seeing in SDSS This is a conserva-
tive threshold since the PSF in SDSS is known quite accurately
Shen et al 2003 Hyde  Bernardi 2009 analysed residuals
from the size-luminosity relation in the SDSS Petrosian r-band
in dierent redshift ranges As expected they found that the ef-
fect of seeing increases as a function of redshift However in our
redshift range 005  z  014 these residuals are close to 0
Our sample consists of bright galaxies in crowded elds
where SDSS reductions tend to overestimate the sky level This
results in underestimates of magnitudes and half-light radius for
large half-light radii galaxies Adelman-McCarthy et al 2008
Bernardi et al 2007 Hyde  Bernardi 2009 In order to cor-
rect the magnitudes and sizes by sky level we have tted curves
to SDSS simulations DR6 documentation and we used these
ts to correct the SDSS reductions Briey SDSS quantied the
sky eect by adding simulated galaxies with exponential or de
Vaucouleurs proles to SDSS images The simulated galaxies
ranged from apparent magnitude r  12 to r  19 in half-
magnitude steps with a one-to-one mapping from r to Sersic
half-light radius Sersic 1963 1968 determined using the mean
observed relation between these quantities for MGS with ex-
ponential and de Vaucouleurs proles Axis ratios of 05 and 1

In this section we use the r-band concentration index C to split
galaxies into early and late types as explained in section 22
In Figure 6 we show the correlation between luminosity and the
Petrosian half-light radius r50  L We plot the median val-
ues of logr50 versus M01
for the C-P04-I sample top panels
and the C-K07-I sample bottom panels Error bars were ob-
tained by the bootstrap re-sampling technique Slopes and zero
points in this work correspond to a least-square linear regression
The dotted lines show the 95 condence bands of the linear
regressions  Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters
show similar size-luminosity relations Early and late type galax-
ies red and blue lines respectively show clear dierences late
type galaxies being larger than early types for xed luminosities
If clusters and eld galaxies are compared we can see in Figure
6 and Table 2 that late type galaxies in the eld cyan lines are
smaller than galaxies in clusters for a x luminosity
For early type galaxies magenta lines the dierences be-
tween eld and cluster galaxies are also present although they
are smaller The eect is stronger for MaxBCG clusters Finally
in the common range of luminosity BCGs black lines tend to
be larger and show a steeper logr50 - M01
relation than non-
BCG early type galaxies in clusters Except for BCGs early type
galaxies in clusters and in the eld show the previously reported
curvature in the size-luminosity relation Bernardi et al 2007
For these samples of galaxies linear ts exclude the brightest
luminosity bin
We compare our results of the r50  M01
relation of
BCGs with other studies von der Linden et al 2007 performed
isophotal photometry from the C4 cluster catalogue Miller et al
2005 and they found a slope   065  002 for BCGs and
  063002 for a control sample Liu et al 2007 derived the
luminosity-size relation for 85 BCGs from the same catalogue
performing isophotal photometry down to four isophotal limits
22 23 24 and 25 mag arcsec2 they found that the luminosity-
size relation become steeper as the isophotal limit becomes
fainter for both BCGs and control sample galaxies The slope
varies between 063004 and 088004 for BCGs and between
058  004 and 074  004 for the control sample Although
these authors used a similar photometry to von der Linden et al
2007 the dierence in the slopes could be related to the dif-
ferences in the brightness of the samples Bernardi et al 2007
tted a de Vaucouleurs model to SDSS images from the C4 cat-
alogue and used the half-light radius of their best-tting mod-
els to study the luminosity-size relation These authors found
a slope   089 Lauer et al 2007 used surface photome-
try in HST images for 219 early type galaxies and also tted
a de Vaucouleurs model they found   118  006 Once
again the photometry used in the last two works is similar but
the results are very dierent Again a suitable explanation is
the dierence in the construction of the samples On the other
hands Guo et al 2009 used 911 central galaxies from SDSS
DR4 Group catalogue Yang et al 2007 This catalogue is con-
structed using the New York University Value-Addes Galaxy
Catalog Blanton et al 2005b Guo et al 2009 tted a Sersic
luminosity prole to each galaxy using GALFIT Peng et al
2002 and found a slope   102  003 over the luminos-
ity range 19 to 24 For galaxies brighter than 22 these au-

found   06 for early-type galaxies while BCGs follow a
steeper relation It should be noted that the slopes resulting from
our work are typically shallower than the slopes found in the
dierent works mentioned above Partially these dierences in
slopes could be the result of the dierent methods used to per-
form the photometry While the works mentioned above used
de Vaucouleurs isophotal or Sersic models we used Petrosian
magnitudes and sizes In addition the sample selection causes
variations in the value of the slopes for example the use or not of
spectroscopic data can introduce important dierences in the re-
sults as has been demonstrated by Coenda et al 2006 Beyond
the dierences in the slopes it should be noted that BCGs always
follow a steeper relation than galaxies in control samples
32 Dynamicalrelations
It is known that velocity dispersion and luminosity are well cor-
related for early-type galaxies L   a relation known as
Faber-Jackson Faber  Jackson 1976 Figure 7 shows the me-
dian values of log  as function of M01
for early-type galax-
ies in clusters red lines control sample magenta lines and
BCGs black lines Table 3 gives the parameters of the ts
where we can appreciate that there are no dierences between
ts corresponding to both cluster samples Where we do see
a clear dierence is between galaxies in clusters both BCGs
and non-BCGs and eld galaxies the latter being dynamically
cooler show lower mean velocity dispersions The log -M01
also presents a departure from linearity for the brightest bin
where bright early type galaxies show a lower velocity disper-
sion than that expected from the linear relation that ts the lower
magnitude bins BCGs show a log -M01
relation atter than
that of non-BCG galaxies Nevertheless the mean velocity dis-
persion that corresponds to the brightest luminosity bin of non-
BCG galaxies is consistent with the values expected for BCGs
Therefore the attening of the log -M01
relation observed for
BCGs see also Bernardi et al 2007 could be a general prop-
erty of early type galaxies regardless of its nature as the brightest
cluster galaxy Liu et al 2007 and von der Linden et al 2007
found that BCGs have a Faber-Jackson relation steeper than that
of early-type galaxies On the contrary Bernardi et al 2007
found a shallower relation for BCGs consistent with our nd-

have on average the same velocity dispersions at a given lu-

should be expected In Figure 8 we show the median value of

the three samples we plot a linear regression that conrm that
BCGs have on average higher dynamical masses than early-
type galaxies of the same magnitude the tting parameters are
given in Table 4 It should be noted that these dierences are
more signicant for MaxBCG clusters C-K07-I than for X-ray
clusters C-P04-I Field galaxies in control samples show lower
dynamical masses than non-BCGs in clusters

dence of colour remains strong Blanton  Berlind 2007 found
that the relation between galaxy colors and the distance from the
centre of groups has a residual relationship on the clustering of
galaxies at small scales  300h1 Kpc In this work we are
interested in the study of the segregation of several properties
of bright galaxies in clusters as a function of rr200 and its de-
pendence on the cluster identication techniques Coenda et al
2006 found that these type of analysis can produce dier-
ent results depending on whether redshift-conrmed members
or galaxies in projection are considered Although we are only
considering bright galaxies our analysis is based on conrmed
members in volume limited galaxy samples identied with two
dierent criteria and galaxies extracted from the same galaxy
catalogue The characteristics of these samples make them suit-
able for an unbiased analysis of the properties of galaxies and its
dependence on the cluster environment
As we explained in section 22 we have adopted several cri-
teria to classify galaxies into morphological classes or types We
have used in our analysis the following parameters the g  r
colour the concentration index C the eclass parameter and the
Sersic index n Although they are not independent they are dom-
inated by dierent physical properties of galaxies
Figure 9 shows the fraction of early type galaxies as a func-
tion of the clustocentric radius For both cluster samples a clear
dependence of rr200 with g  r C and eclass is found panels
a to c The correlation is up to rr200  1 for larger clusto-
centric distances we do not see any tendency For the Sersic in-
dex n panel d we only observe a dependence for the C-K07-I
sample The comparison between the two cluster samples shows
that the X-ray selected clusters always present a higher fraction
of early type galaxies in the whole range of clustocentric dis-
tances As it was pointed out previously the X-ray sample has
a slightly higher fraction of massive clusters than the MaxBCG
sample In order to test if this dierence in the mass distributions
can be responsible for the higher fraction of early type galaxies
in C-P04-I than in C-K07-I sample we constructed a new sub-
sample C-K07-M that consists of galaxies selected at random
from C-K07-I having the same parent-cluster mass distribution
as C-P04-I As can be appreciated in gure 9 the fractions of

early type galaxies as a function of rr200 for C-K07-M dotted
lines are indistinguishable from those corresponding to the C-
K07-I sample indicating that our nding of a higher fraction of
early type galaxies in X-ray than in MaxBCG clusters is inde-
pendent of the dynamical mass distribution
In panel a of gure 10 we show the fraction of galax-
ies brighter than M01
r  225 as a function of the normal-
ized clustocentric distance Analogously to the morphological
segregation we can see a clear dependence of this fraction for
rr200  1 in the sense that galaxies brighter M01
r  225
preferentially inhabit the cluster centres This trend is stronger
for the C-K07-I sample Alternatively in panel b we show the
median values of M01
as a function rr200 We observe the de-
pendence between the median M01
and rr200 for the C-K07-I
sample This eect is not observed for C-P04-I sample The dis-
persion observed in mean values of M01
especially for C-P04-I
sample is due to the natural spread of the luminosity function
As discussed in section 31 the study of galaxy sizes and
their relation to the luminosity helps to understand the galaxy
formation and evolution Here we study a possible dependence
of galaxy size r50 as a function of rr200 Panel a in Figure
11 shows the median value of r50 versus the normalized clusto-
centric distance for the C-P04-I sample grey line and for the
C-K07-I sample black line For clustocentric distances larger
than 08 mean sizes of galaxies remain almost constant being
slightly larger for galaxies in X-ray clusters than in the MaxBCG
sample although the same eect is observed for eld galaxies
horizontal dashed lines in gure 11 For smaller clustocentric
distances median sizes show dierent behaviour for galaxies in
the C-P04-I sample median values of r50 decrease as rr200 goes
to zero whereas the opposite behaviour is observed for galaxies
in the C-K07-I sample Panel b in Figure 11 shows the median
value of the rband surface brightness 50 computed inside r50
as a function of rr200 For both cluster samples 50 decreases as
rr200 goes to zero Field galaxies have lower surface brightness
black horizontal line than cluster members
Figure 12 repeats the previous analysis using only early type
galaxies In the left panels we show this relation for the C-P04-
I sample while C-K07-I sample are shown in the right panels
We have also evaluated the inuence of BCGs in our results re-
peating the analysis without BCGs dotted lines Analogously to
Figure 11 the sizes of early type galaxies increase when rr200
decreases in the C-K07-I sample Nevertheless this tendency
disappears when BCGs are excluded On the other hand the me-
dian values of r50 decrease as rr200 goes to zero for the C-P04-I
sample this eect is stronger when BCGs are excluded These
results clearly show an important dierence between clusters
identied with dierent criteria As can be appreciated in g-
ure 3 a higher fraction of early type galaxies is observed for the
X-ray selected clusters Consequently the dierent behaviour
observed in Figure 12 could be the result of the dierences in
the population of early type galaxies between the two samples

For instance a higher fraction of elliptical galaxies in the early
type population of the X-ray selected clusters with respect to
the MaxBCG sample could produce a dierent behaviour in the
mean sizes as a function of rr200 In order to test this possibil-
ity we repeated the analysis of Figure 12 selecting early type
galaxies with c  31 This new threshold includes a third of the
early type galaxies previously analyzed and it will mostly select
elliptical galaxies For this sub-sample of early type galaxies
we nd the same trend observed in Figure 12 conrming that
there is a dependence of the mean sizes of early type galaxies
on the cluster selection criterion Based on a sample of 228 el-
liptical galaxies in 24 clusters Cypriano et al 2006 found that
elliptical galaxies in the inner regions of clusters are typically
5 smaller than those in the outer regions These authors inter-
preted these results in terms of the tidal stripping of stars that
lead to changes in the whole structure of galaxies in the central
regions of clusters
Figure 13 is the analogous of Figure 12 for late-type galax-
ies Although galaxies in X-ray selected clusters show a ten-
dency on average r50 to be smaller towards the cluster centers
this behaviour is not statistically signicant

5 Discussion and conclusions
We have compiled two catalogues of massive clusters of galax-
ies based on samples that make use of dierent identication
techniques the P04 sample that comprises bright X-ray galaxy
clusters and the K07 sample constructed according to the prop-
erties of early-type galaxies We selected sub-samples of galaxy
clusters in the redshift range 005  z  014 For both samples
member galaxies are brighter that M01
r  213 and were iden-
tied from a spectroscopic volume-limited sample of the DR5-
SDSS In order to select a fair sample of clusters of galaxies we
use the fof algorithm and an eyeball examination of each over-
density identied by fof Throughout the visual inspection we
classied the clusters based on their substructure We only con-
sider in our analysis regular clusters and we exclude systems
that have two or more close substructures of similar size in the
plane of the sky andor in the redshift distribution In addition
we have determined new positions in the plane of the sky and in
the line of sight We found that for  40 of the clusters the

angular position given by fof is better than the original value
whereas for  17 of the clusters the redshift given by fof is
a better match to the observed mean redshift distribution than
the original value Our nal sample comprises 49 X-ray selected
clusters with 786 galaxies and 209 MaxBCG clusters with 3041
galaxies We have determined the following physical properties
of clusters the line-of-sight velocity dispersion  the virial ra-
dius and mass and r200
We have analyzed dierent scaling relations between pho-
tometric and dynamical parameters Bright galaxies were sep-
arated in early and late types according to several criteria We
have also studed the segregation of galaxies analysing dier-
ent properties as a function of the normalized clustocentric dis-
tances The main results are
 Galaxies in X-ray and MaxBCG selected clusters show sim-
ilar size-luminosity relations
 We found that each galaxy type has a dierent luminosity-
size relation This implies a dierent mass-luminosity rela-
tion andor a dierent star formation history
 For each luminosity bin late type galaxies in the eld have
sizes smaller than their cluster counterpart
 The same eect is observed for early type galaxies although
the dierences are smaller The stronger eect corresponds
to galaxies in MaxBCG clusters
 At xed luminosity BCGs tend to be larger and show a
relation than non-BCG early type
steeper logr50 - M01
galaxies in clusters
 Non-BCGs early type galaxies in clusters and in the eld
show the known curvature in the size-luminosity relation
Fig 13 Median values of r50 as a function of rr200 for late-type
galaxies analogously to gure 12
 The Faber-Jackson relation for early-type galaxies in clusters
is the same in X-ray and MaxBCG clusters
 We found a clear dierence between galaxies in clusters
both BCGs and non-BCG and in the eld showing the later
lower values of the velocity dispersion at xed luminosity
 The log -M01
relation presents at the bright end a depar-
ture from linearity Bright early type galaxies show a lower
velocity dispersion than the expected from the linear relation
at lower magnitudes
 BCGs show a atter log -M01
relation than non-BCG
galaxies Nevertheless the velocity dispersion of the bright-
est non-BCG galaxies are consistent with the values ex-
pected for BCGs
 At xed luminosity BCGs have on average higher dynam-
ical masses than early-type galaxies in clusters The dier-
ence is more signicant for MaxBCG clusters than for X-ray
selected clusters
 At xed luminosity eld early type galaxies in the control
samples show lower dynamical masses than non-BCG early
type galaxies in clusters
 Using several criteria to classify galaxies into morphological
classes we found the well know morphological segregation
for both samples of clusters The correlation is up to rr200 
1 for larger clustocentric distances we do not see any trend
 For the whole range of clustocentric distances X-ray se-
lected clusters have a higher fraction of early type galaxies
than MaxBCG clusters
 Within rr200  1 we found a dependence of the fraction
of galaxies brighter than M01
r  225 as a function of the
normalized clustocentric distance Bright galaxies preferen-
tially inhabit the cluster centers This tendency is stronger
for MaxBCG clusters
 For clustocentric distances larger than 08 mean sizes of
galaxies remain almost constant being slightly larger for
galaxies in X-ray selected clusters than in the MaxBCG sam-

 For rr200  08 median sizes depend on the cluster sam-
ple For galaxies in X-ray selected clusters median values of
r50 decrease as rr200 goes to zero whereas the opposite is
observed for galaxies in the MaxBCG clusters
 For MaxBCG clusters the sizes of early type galaxies in-
crease as rr200 decreases The trend disappears when BCGs
are excluded On the contrary the median value of r50 de-
crease as rr200 goes to zero for X-ray selected clusters The
eect is stronger when BCGs are excluded
Early type galaxies in the eld are lower have lower veloc-
ity dispersion and have smaller virial masses than their cluster
counterpart On the other hand BCGs are larger and have higher
values of the virial masses than non-BCG in clusters although
the velocity dispersions are comparable These dierences in the
properties of early type galaxies in the eld in clusters and with
BCGs are consistent with the scenario where the environment
plays a fundamental rol in the formation histories of galaxies
These results suggest three dierent formation scenarios BCGs
being the galaxies less aected by dissipation Dry mergers have
no energy loss mechanism therefore the formed galaxies are less
centrally contracted with optical sizes larger than those of galax-
ies that have undergone a dissipative merger Kormendy 1989
Nipoti et al 2003 Bernardi et al 2007 Weinmann et al 2009
and Guo et al 2009 analyzed the size-luminosity relation of
galaxies in groups where the environmental eects are supposed
to be dierent to those expected in clusters These authors found
the same size-luminosity relation for both central and satellite
early type galaxies The dierent results between galaxies in
groups and clusters also support the idea that the size-luminosity
relation depends on the environment
At the same luminosity late-type galaxies in clusters have
larger sizes and therefore lower surface brightness than their
eld counterparts control sample This is in agreement with
the scenario of strangulation Larson et al 1980 where the gas
in the halo is stripped suppressing the supply of cold gas and
therefore aecting the star formation rate and the galaxy lumi-
nosity
The X-ray selected sample C-P04-I is made of bright X-ray
galaxy clusters whereas the C-K07-I sample was constructed
according to the properties of early-type galaxies Several clus-
ters in the C-K07-I sample should be X-ray emitters although
they would be on average less X-ray luminous than C-P04-
I clusters The fact that X-ray selected clusters show a higher
fraction of early type galaxies whose sizes tend to decrease to-
wards the cluster center eect that is not observed for galaxies
in MaxBCG clusters can be interpreted as possible evidence that
the hot intracluster medium is also playing a role in the evolution
of early type galaxies Alternatively the observed eect could
be caused by dierences in the clusters masses Even though the
eects mentioned above are also present for sub-samples of C-
P04-I and C-K07-I with the same virial mass distribution due
to the usual uncertainties in the computation of these masses
we cannot discard dierences in the actual mass distributions
If this is the case and C-P04-I clusters are on average more
massive than C-K07-I decreases in the mean sizes of early type
galaxies in X-ray selected clusters could be the result of tidal
stripping that can produce changes in the structure of galaxies
see the results from numerical simulations of Aguilar  White
1986 and observational evidences from Trujillo et al 2002
and Cypriano et al 2006 This dierence between X-ray and
MaxBCG selected clusters is an unexpected result that should be
explored in more detail
