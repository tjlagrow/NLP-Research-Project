Abstract 
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ARDS is a very severe syndrome leading to 
respiratory failure and subsequent mortality Sepsis is one of the leading causes of 
ARDS Thus extracellular bacteria play an important role in the pathophysiology of 
ARDS Overactivated neutrophils are the major effector cells in ARDS Thus 
extracellular bacteria triggered TH17-like innate immunity with neutrophil activation 
might accounts for the etiology of ARDS Here microarray analysis was employed to 
describe TH17-like innate immunity-related cytokine including TGF- and IL-6 
up-regulation in whole blood of ARDS patients It was found that the innate 
TH17-related TLR12458 HSP70 G-CSF GM-CSF complements defensin PMN 
chemokines cathepsins Fc receptors NCFs FOS JunB CEBPs NFkB and leukotriene 
B4 are all up-regulated TGF- secreting Treg cells play important roles in lung fibrosis 
Up-regulation of Treg associated STAT5B and TGF- with down-regulation of MHC 
genes TCR genes and co-stimulation molecule CD86 are noted Key TH17 
transcription factors STAT3 and ROR are down-regulated Thus the full adaptive 
TH17 helper CD4 T cells may not be successfully triggered Many fibrosis promoting 
genes are also up-regulated including MMP8 MMP9 FGF13 TIMP1 TIMP2 PLOD1 
P4HB P4HA1 PDGFC HMMR HS2ST1 CHSY1 and CSGALNACT Failure to induce 
successful adaptive immunity could also attribute to ARDS pathogenesis Thus ARDS 
is actually a TH17-like and Treg immune disorder   
Introduction 
Acute respiratory distress syndrome ARDS is a severe cause of respiratory failure 
Despite of current treatment the mortality rate remains very high We still dont 
have successful management strategies to deal with ARDS Most important of all we 
still dont know the exact pathophysiology of ARDS Sepsis or bacteremia is the 
leading cause of ARDS Besides neutrophil activation is reported in many studies in 
the lungs of ARDS patients It was hypothesized that extracellular bacteria-induced 
TH17 immunity overactivation might be the etiology of ARDS Microarray analysis to 
will be used to study the immune-related gene profiles in peripheral leukocytes of 
ARDS patients   
According to Harrisons internal medicine the time course of ARDS can be divided 
into three stages1 First the exudative phase In this phase injured alveolar 
capillary endothelium and type I pneumocytes cause the loss of tight alveolar barrier 
Thus edema fluid rich in protein accumulate in the interstitial alveolar spaces It has 
been reported that cytokines IL-1 IL-6 and TNF- and chemokines IL-8 and 
leukotriene B4 are present in lung in this phase 2 3 A great numbers of 
neutrophils traffic into the pulmonary interstitium and alveoli4 5 Alveolar edema 
predominantly leads to diminished aeration and atelectasis Hyaline membranes 
start to develop Then intrapulmonary shunting and hypoxemia develop The 
situation is even worse with microvascular occlusion which leads to increasing dead 
space and pulmonary hypertension The exudative phase encompasses the first 
seven days of disease after exposure to a precipitating ARDS risk factor such as sepsis 
aspiration pneumonia bacterial pneumonia pulmonary contusion near drowning 
toxic inhalation injury severe trauma burns multiple transfusions drug overdose 
pancreatitis and post-cardiopulmonary bypass   
Second proliferative phase This phase usually lasts from day 7 to day 21 Although 
many patients could recover during this stage some patients develop progressive 
lung injury and early change of pulmonary fibrosis Histologically this phase is the 
initiation of lung repair organization of alveolar exudates and a shift from a 
neutrophil to a lymphocyte dominant pulmonary infiltrate There is a proliferation of 
type II pneumocytes which can synthesize new pulmonary surfactants They can also 
differentiate into type I pneumocytes In addition there is beginning of type III 
procollagen peptide presence which is the marker of pulmonary fibrosis 
Third fibrotic phase Although many patients with ARDS recover lung function three 
weeks after the initial lung injury some enter a fibrotic phase that may require long 
term support on mechanical ventilators Histologically the alveolar edema and 
inflammatory exudates in early phases are converted to extensive alveolar duct and 
interstitial fibrosis Intimal fibroproliferation in the pulmonary microvascular system 
leads to progressive vascular occlusion and pulmonary hypertension     
Material and Methods 
Microarray dataset 
According to Dr J A Howrylaks research in Physiol Genomics 2009 who collected 
total RNA from whole blood in sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS patients6 He tried 
to find out molecular signature of ARDS compared to sepsis patients His dataset is 
available in Gene Expression Omnibus GEO wwwncbinlmnihgovgeo accession 
number GSE 10474 The total number of his sepsis-induced ARDS is 13 The overall 
mortality of these patients is 38 The second dataset is from GSE20189 of Gene 
Expression Omnibus This dataset was collected by Dr Melissa Rotunno in Cancer 
Prevention Research 20117 Molecular signature of early stage of lung 
adenocarcinoma was studied by microarray We use the healthy control sample size 
21 whole blood RNA from this dataset to compare the ARDS patients In this study 
we perform further analysis to study peripheral leukocyte gene expression profiles of 
ARDS compared to those of healthy controls   
Statistical analysis 
Affymetrix HG-U133A 20 genechip was used in both samples RMA express software 
UC Berkeley Board Institute was used to do normalization and to rule out the 
outliners of the above dataset The potential outliners of samples were removed 
according to the following criteria   
1 samples which have strong deviation in NUSE plot 
2 samples which have broad spectrum in RLE value plot 
3 samples which have strong deviation in RLE-NUSE mutiplot 
4 samples which exceed 99 line in RLE-NUSE T2 plot 
Then Genespring XI software was done to analyze the significantly expressed genes 
between ARDS and healthy control leukocytes P value cut-off point is set to be less 
than 005 Fold change cut-off point is 20 fold change Benjamini-hochberg 
corrected false discovery rate was used during the analysis Totally a genelist of 3348 
genes was generated from the HGU133A20 chip with 18400 transcripts including 
14500 well-characterized human genes 
RT-PCR confirmation 
Dr J A Howrylak performed real time PCR for selected transcripts cip1 kip2 by 
using TaqMan Gene Expression Assays Applied Biosystems Foster City CA In the 
second dataset Dr Melissa Rotunno also performed qRT-PCR test to validate the 
microarray results RNA quantity and quality was determined by using RNA 600 
LabChip-Aligent 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA purification was done by the reagents from 
Qiagen Inc All real-time PCRs were conducted by using an ABI Prism 7000 Sequence 
Detection System with the designed primers and probes for target genes and an 
internal control gene-GAPDH This confirms that their microarray results are 
convincing compared to RT-PCR results

TH17-like innate immunity and Treg-related genes are up-regulated in ARDS 
Based on the microarray analysis we found out that many TH17-related genes are 
up-regulated in ARDS including Toll-like receptors 12458 complement heat shock 
protein 70 cathpesin S100A proteins leukotrienes defensins TH17-related 
chemokines and MMPs Many fibrosis related genes are also up-regulated including 
key collagen synthesis enzymes and fibroblast growth factor Key TH17 initiating 
cytokines including TGF beta and IL-6 are also up-regulated This explains that 
TH17-like immunity is initiated in ARDS NK cell and T cell related genes are 
down-regulated This explains that TH1 or TH immunological pathway is not 
triggered in ARDS In addition TGFB1 and STAT5B up-regulations suggest that Treg 
cells play important roles in ARDS pathogenesis Table 1-14 
In Table 1 it can be seen that the TLR1 2458 were up-regulated with the 
expression of IRAK4 Thus toll-like receptor signaling is generated during ARDS It is 
worth noting that TLR12458 are all anti-bacteria TH17 innate immunity signaling 
TLR8 is against CpG rich oligonucleotides Thus strong TH17-like related Toll 
signaling can be activated 
In Table 2 differentiated expression of heat shock proteins can be seen Most 
important of all HSPA1A HSPA1B and HSPA4 are up-regulated HSPA1A and HSPA1B 
are greater than 60 fold up-regulation These heat shock proteins are HSP70 family 
which can activate TH17 related toll-like receptors TLR2 and TLR4 to generate 
anti-bacterial immunity Because of the co-upregulation of TLR24 and HSP70 it is 
evident that the proinflammatory signaling is generated in acute lung injury 
In Table 3 chemokine and chemokine receptor genes are differentially regulated 
TH1 T cell chemotaxis factor CCL5 with its receptor CCR1 and CCL4 with its receptor 
CCR5 are both down-regulated TH2 eosinophil chemotaxic factor receptor CCR3 and 
TH NK cell chemotaxic factors XCL1 and XCL2 are all down-regulated However 
TH17-related chemokines such as PAF related molecules and S100A binding proteins 
are up-regulated These findings suggest that TH17-like related response to recruit 
neutrophils is initiated Toll-like receptor signaling can activate these TH17-like 
chemokines   
In Table 4 strikingly and surprisingly all the MHC related genes are down-regulated 
during acute lung injury These genes include HLA-DRB HLA-DRA HLA-DQB HLA-DPA 
HLA-DQA and HLA-DMB The HLA-DQA1 has the lowest expression level with greater 
than 58 fold down-regulation Thus MHC antigen presentation genes are 
down-regulated in acute lung injury 
In Table 5 many immune-related transcription factors are up-regulated or 
down-regulated Key Treg related key transcription factor STAT5B is up-regulated8 
And TH and TH1 related key transcription factor STAT1 is down-regulated In 
addition TH2 related transcription factor GATA3 is also down-regulated Surprisingly 
key TH17 transcription factors STAT3 and ROR are down-regulated9 These 
findings suggest that full TH17 immunity may not be activated during ARDS Other 
innate immunity related genes for myeloid or granulocyte lineages are up-regulated 
including AP1 Fos and Jun CEBP family genes and NFIL3 It is worth noting that the 
inhibitor of NFkB key innate immunity mediator is down-regulated in acute lung 
injury Besides T cell related transcription factors including NFATC3 NFAT5 and 
NFATC2IP are down-regulated in ARDS JAK2 a signal transduction for all cytokines 
and STATs proteins is also up-regulated STAT5B is the key transcription factor for 
regulatory T cells And down-regulation of ROR and STAT3 means only TH17-like 
innate immunity is activated in acute lung injury 
In Table 6 it can be seen that many chemotaxic factors leukotrienes and 
prostaglandins are up-regulated or down-regulated The key enzyme leukotriene A4 
hydrolase for leukotriene B4 a potent PMN chemoattractant is up-regulated 
Besides leukotriene B4 receptor is also up-regulated Furthermore the receptor of 
PGD2 a TH2 related effector molecule is 9 fold down-regulated In addition the 
gene 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase HPGD which is responsible for 
shutting down prostaglandin is 27 fold up-regulated Key molecules including 
phospholipase A 2 and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase to initiate leukotriene synthesis 
are also up-regulated in ARDS And formyl peptide receptor 2 another chemotaxic 
receptor of PMN is also up-regulated Innate immune initiators SERPINB1 and 
SERPINB2 are also up-regulated in acute lung injury 
In Table 7 many fibrosis related genes are up-regulated during ARDS Most strikingly 
Matrix metalloproteinase 8 MMP8 has greater than 28 fold up-regulation Matrix 
metalloproteinase 9 MMP9 has greater than 11 fold up-regulation MMP8  MMP9 
play key roles in the pathogenesis of ARDS10 In addition MMP25 TIMP1 and 
TIMP2 are also up-regulated in ARDS Thus severe extracellular matrix destruction 
happens in ARDS Fibroblast growth factors including FGF13 5 fold up-regulation 
and PDGFc 12 fold up-regulation are also significantly expressed Chondroitin 
sulfate deposition is reported in pulmonary fibrosis 11 In this study chondroitin 
sulfate synthetase and chondroitin sulfate N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1  2 
are also found up-regulated There is 75 fold up-regulation in chondroitin sulfate 
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 and 13 fold up-regulation in chondroitin sulfate 
N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2 Carboxypeptidase D which can up-regulate 
nitric oxide is also up-regulated in acute lung injury12 Previous studies also found 
up-regulation of iNOS as well as nitric oxide during the inflammation in ARDS13 
Heparanse and heparan sulfate 2-O-sulfotransferase 1 are also up-regulated in ARDS 
Heparan sulfate sulfation is a potent stimulation of FGF signaling to cause fibrosis 14 
15 Hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor RHAMM is also up-regulated 
Hyaluronan plays an important role in pulmonary fibrosis In addition key collagen 
synthesis enzymes prolyl-4-hydroxylases and procollagen-lysine 1 2-oxoglutarate 
5-dioxygenase are also up-regulated in ARDS16 17 
In Table 8 many complement related genes are up-regulated including CD59 C1QB 
ITGAM CR1 C3AR1 ITGAX C1QA C1RL and C5AR1 Complements are important in 
the TH17 arm to kill extracellular bacteria Thus the whole complement machinery is 
activated in ARDS In addition two defensin genes DEFA1B3 and DEFA4 are also 
up-regulated to defend the possible bacterial infection Neutrophil overactivity with 
up-regulated complements and defensins plays a vital role in acute lung injury 
In Table 9 many cathepsin genes are up-regulated in acute respiratory distress 
syndrome including CTSK CTSG CTSZ CTSA CTSD and CTSC except CTSO and CTSW 
Cathepsins are important proteases in antigen processing Thus antigen processing 
is likely to be activated in ARDS However MHC related genes are down-regulated in 
acute lung injury In addition myeloperoxidase which is the enzyme responsible for 
ingested bacteria killing is upregulated in ARDS Neutrophil cytosolic factor 1  4 
the subunit of NADPH oxidase for ingested bacteria killing are also up-regulated in 
In Table 10 two CSF receptors are up-regulated in acute lung injury CSF2 receptor 
GM-CSF receptor is more than two fold up-regulated And CSF3 receptor G-CSF 
receptor is also more than two fold up-regulated GM-CSF and G-CSF can stimulate 
granulocyte and monocyte proliferation It means that myeloid and granulocyte 
lineages are proliferative in ARDS     
In Table 11 Fc receptor related genes including IgG Fc receptor 2A IgA Fc receptor 
IgG Fc receptor 2C IgG Fc receptor 1B and IgG Fc receptor 1A1C are up-regulated in 
ARDS These Fc receptors CD32  CD64 expressed on myeloid lineages are related 
to TH17-related immunological pathway Besides TH2 related IgE Fc receptor 1A is 
down-regulated These findings support that TH17-like armed innate immune 
response is activated in acute lung injury 
In Table 12 many TH17-like related cytokine genes are up-regulated in ARDS Most 
importantly the central TH17 cytokine initiators TGFB1 and IL-6 are up-regulated in 
ARDS Thrombospondin THBS1 the activator of TGFB is also strongly up-regulated 
In addition TH22 related cytokines such as IL32 and IL1A are down-regulated And 
IL1RN an IL1 antagonist is up-regulated The receptors of TH17 immunity are also 
down-regulated including IL17RA IL6R and TGFBR3 The receptors for Treg pathway 
are also down-regulated including IL2RB and TGFBR3 However the key TH17 
downstream IL-6TGF inducing transcription factors STAT3 and ROR are 
down-regulated These findings suggest that only TH17-like innate immunity is 
up-regulated Other immunological pathway cytokine receptors are up-regulated 
including IL1RA IL1R2 IL1R1 IL4R IL18R1 IFNGR1 IFNGR2 IFNAR1 and TNFRSF1A 
Besides TH1 or TH associated interferon related genes are down-regulated 
including ISG20L2 IFI16 GVINP1 GBP1 IFI44L and IFIT3 In addition FAS is 
up-regulated and Fas apoptotic inhibitory molecule 3 FAIM3 is down-regulated 
These findings suggest that apoptosis machinery is activated in ARDS   
In Table 13 many important CD molecules are differentially regulated CD molecules 
are important in mediating host immune reaction Thus the up-regulation or 
down-regulation of these CD molecules suggests the status of host immunity From 
this table we can see that many T cell activation molecules are down-regulated 
including CD8A CD3G CD3D and CD86 CD8A is the molecule of cytotoxic T cell 
activation CD3G is the molecule for helper or killer T cell activation CD86 is the key 
co-stimulation signal to activate B cells and T cells Thus the adoptive immunity 
including B and T lymphocytes are not likely to be activated in ARDS   
In the Table 14 many NK cells and T cell related molecules are seen to be 
down-regulated Molecules related to NK cell activation include grazymes GZMK 
GZMM GZMB and GZMH perforinPRF1 and killer cell receptors KLRK1 KLRD1 
KLRG1 KLRB1 NKTR and KLRF1 NKTR is 13-fold down-regulated and granulysin 
GNLY is 5-fold down-regulated NK cells are the key effector cells in TH immunity 
Thus TH immunity is not activated or even down-regulated in ARDS In addition 
many TCR related genes are also down-regulated including TRBC1 TRACJ17V20 
TRBC2 TRD TRAPTRGC2 and TRDV3 Several TCR related genes have greater than 
5-fold down-regulation We can see the down-regulations of MHC genes CD 
costimulation molecules STAT3 and TCR genes as well as the up-regulation of TGFB1 
and STAT5B These findings suggest that T cells are not activated in the acute lung 
injury Thus adaptive immunity cannot be successfully triggered in ARDS Because 
successful adaptive TH17 helper cells need at least three signals TGF IL-6 and TCR 
The absence of TCR signal cannot fully trigger TH17 CD4 T cells Our findings suggest 
that Treg plays an important role in ARDS pathophysiology 
Discussion 
ARDS is a very severe respiratory complication Sepsis is the major risk factor of ARDS 
Sepsis is caused by the uncontrolled bacteremia due to bacterial infection In 
addition PMNs overactivation is very important in the pathogenesis of ARDS Thus 
extracellular bacteria induced TH17 immunity with neutrophil activation might be 
the key in the pathophysiology of ARDS   
Here I propose a detail pathogenesis to explain the three stages of ARDS In the first 
exudative stage neutrophils are attracted to lung due to chemotaxic agents such as 
IL-8 or C5 or leukotriene B4 During sepsis bacterial infection in pulmonary tissue can 
trigger pulmonary epithelial cells pulmonary endothelial cells pulmonary fibroblast 
and alveolar macrophage to be activated Toll-like receptors 1245 as well as heat 
shock proteins HSP60 HSP70 are key molecules to trigger TH17 host immunity 
18-26 Heat shock proteins are important stress proteins in situation such as burn 
trauma hemorrhagic shock near drowning or acute pancreatitis27-29 HSP60 and 
HSP70 can activate TH-17 related Toll-like receptors Thus TH17 related cytokines 
such as IL-17 IL-1 TNF- and IL-6 as well as TH-17 related chemokines such as IL-8 
and other CXCL group chemokines will be triggered Bacterial infection can let 
pulmonary epithelial cells to release chemokines and cytokines30-32 TH17 
cytokines will start to activate TH17 immunity including activating PMN effector 
function for immunity against extracellular bacteria The cytokine storm during ARDS 
is now explained However in this study it was found that CD86 costimulation signal 
TCR genes and majority of MHC genes are down-regulated in ARDS Thus adaptive 
full TH17 immunity related effective and specific antibody and TCR response against 
bacteria may not be triggered However one research found that there is IL-8 
autoantibody in ARDS patients33 IL-8 as well as leukotriene B4 is the main 
chemoattractant in pulmonary tissue34-40 It was first identified in lung giant cell 
lines41 Besides IL-8 has high affinity to bind to the heparin sulfate and chondroitin 
sulfate-enriched lung tissue42 43 And IL-8 retention in pulmonary tissue can 
further recruit neutrophils to lung This can explain why IL-8 secreted from distant 
site such as pancreas during acute pancreatitis can cause ARDS However IL-8 itself is 
not changed in this study And there are several limitations in the IL8 autoantibody 
study 33 First anti-IL8-IL8 complex can be detected in 55 of healthy control 
serum There is no significant difference of IL8-antiI-L8 complex between ARDS 
patients serum and healthy controls serum In addition IL8 autoantibody can 
suppress IL8 binding activity for neutrophils and it can reduce IL8s chemotaxic 
activity Thus IL8 autoantibodys importance in ARDS pathogenesis is doubtful 
Besides several studies can support the role of TH17 immunity in the pathogenesis 
of ARDS G-CSF the growth factor of neutrophils can cause the common symptoms 
of ARDS44 And suppression of NFkB can attenuate ARDS progression45 46 Key 
TH cytokine IL-10 can reduce the severity of ARDS47   
Bacterial infection is the most common risk factor of ARDS However certain 
pathogens other than bacteria also are risks for developing ARDS Plasmodium 
falciparum malarial infection can also cause the complication of ARDS The reason for 
this is that Plasmodium falciparum can activate heat shock proteins to trigger TH17 
immunity to cause ARDSauthors paper in press48 SARS-CoV and H1N1 Avian flu 
virus can also down-regulate normal anti-viral interferon- and up-regulate 
TH17-like immunity to trigger ARDS authors paper in press Viral Immunology49 
50 Thus the above phenomena suggest that TH17 inflammation is the key to the 
pathogenesis of ARDS If different pathogens lead to a common pathway of 
TH17-related innate immunity they will cause the same consequence of ARDS It is 
also seen in burn trauma or pancreatitis when TH17-like innate immunity is also 
activated   
In the second proliferative stage lymphocytes replace neutrophils and become the 
dominant population in ARDS These lymphocytes are TH17-like lymphocytes and 
Treg lymphocytes TH17-related cytokines such as IL-17 IL-1 IL-6 and TNF- can 
continue the inflammatory process due to the activation of innate immunity 
However once the bacterial antigen during sepsis is cleared Toll-like receptor 
signaling is stopped and no further proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 are 
synthesized In addition there is no TCR signal found in this study Thus TH17 
adaptive immunity may not be successfully generated This could be very important 
in ARDS pathogenesis In TH17 immunity both TGF- and IL-6 are two important 
triggering cytokines If there is no longer IL-6 signaling only TGF- is generated IL-6 
is the key factor to regulate the balance between Treg cells and TH17 cells If there is 
enough IL-6 Treg cells will become TH17 cells If there is not enough IL-6 TGF- 
secreting Treg cells will be maintained Treg cells are associated with STAT5B 
activation Thus in the third fibrosis stage TGF- secreting Treg cells are the 
dominant effector cells in ARDS51 In this study patients ARDS is induced by 
bacterial sepsis Thus failure to induce specific adaptive immunity such as TCR and 
antibody cannot successfully defeat these bacteria In the early disease stage 
overactive innate immunity with PMN activation causes severe lung consolidation In 
the later stage failure of adaptive immunity against bacteria causes the abundant 
regulatory T cells secreting TGF- TGF- is a very strong fibrosis promoting agent and 
is the most important and potent stimulant in tissue fibrosis52 53 TGF- will 
promote the synthesis of multiple collagen genes54 Thus overproduction of TGF- 
in lung tissue will cause pulmonary fibrosis TGF- caused fibrosis is usually a process 
for repairing cavity after bacterial infection locus such as abscess This mechanism 
can solve many controversial studies before Several studies found that TLR4 and 
heat shock proteins can aggravate ARDS20 However another studies found that 
TLR4 or heat shock protein can protect from pulmonary fibrosis after acute lung 
injury55-57 It is because TLR and heat shock signaling can maintain the activation 
of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 Thus no sole TGF- overproduction 
happens in lung fibrosis In an animal study neutrophil inhibitor can attenuate the 
progression of acute lung injury 58 Thus TH17 and Treg inflammatory process can 
fully explain the pathogenesis of ARDS 
Recently two researches suggested that Treg cells play protective roles in acute lung 
injury59 60 We cannot agree with their suggestions First of all they used Rag-- 
mice and found that ARDS is reduced in Rag-- mice However both B cells and T cells 
are absent in Rag-- mice This finding can be explained that adaptive immune T  B 
lymphocytes relieve the TH17 innate ARDS pathological change They also found that 
CD8 T cells have protective roles in ARDS In this study we found that antigen specific 
T cells are not activated in ARDS Thus specific TCR or antibody response against 
bacteria antigen could not be successfully triggered in acute lung injury If the 
adaptive immunity can be triggered it can limit ARDS pathogenesis Second they 
used a lung injury scoring system to assess the severity of ARDS However the 
scoring system only included lung congestion and inflammatory infiltration The most 
important sequel of ARDS pulmonary fibrosis was not included in their studies Thus 
their conclusion that TGF beta secreting Treg cells can protect ARDS is questionable  
Actually anti-TGFB antibody can prevent mice from lung fibrosis61 After knowing 
the complete pathophysiology ofARDS we may be able to develop better treatment 
strategies to managing this highly detrimental and fatal disease
