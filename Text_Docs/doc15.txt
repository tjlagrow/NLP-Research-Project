Abstract Near-infrared surveys provide one of the best opportunities to investigate
the cosmic evolution of galaxies and their mass assembly We briey review the main
results obtained so far with the K20 and other recent near-IR surveys on the redshift
distribution the evolution of the luminosity function and luminosity density the nature
of old and dusty EROs the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function the properties
of the galaxies in the redshift desert and the nature of luminous starbursts at z  2
1 Introduction
Despite the detection of objects up to z  65 and the impressive success of
the CDM scenario to account for the properties of the cosmic microwave back-
ground one of the main and still controversial questions remains how and when
galaxies assembled their mass as a function of the cosmic time The hierarchical
scenario predicts that galaxies built up their present-day mass through a pro-
gressive assembly of smaller sub-systems driven by the merging of dark matter
With ground-based observations one of the most solid approaches to address
the problems of galaxy formation and evolution is to study samples of eld
faint galaxies selected in the near-infrared particularly in the K-band 22m
323 Firstly since the rest-frame near-IR luminosity is a good tracer of the
galaxy stellar mass 5 K-band surveys allow to select galaxies according to
their mass up to z  15 rest  09  10m At higher redshifts the K-
band starts to sample the rest-frame optical and UV regions and space-based
observations at obs  2m are needed to cover the rest-frame near-infrared eg
SIRTF ASTRO-F Secondly the similarity of the spectral shapes of dierent
galaxy types in the rest-frame near-IR makes the K-band selection free from
strong biases against or in favor of particular classes of galaxies In contrast the
selection of high-z galaxies in the observed optical bands is more sensitive to
the star formation activity than to the stellar mass because it samples the rest-
frame UV light and makes optical samples biased against old passive or weakly
star-forming galaxies Last but not least near-infrared surveys are less aected
by dust extinction than optical surveys
Motivated by the above considerations several near-infrared surveys have
been undertaken during the last decade 121061824171519 Fig 1 Spec-
troscopic surveys are particularly relevant thanks to their capability not only to
derive the redshifts but also to unveil the nature and the spectral properties

Fig 1 Some imaging and spectroscopic near-infrared surveys The redshift complete-
ness is shown for spectroscopic surveys
of the targeted galaxies Since near-IR multi-object spectrographs are not fully
available on 8-10m-class telescopes most spectroscopy of K-selected galaxies has
been done in the optical The most crucial probes of massive galaxy evolution
are galaxies with the very red colors expected in case of passive evolution at
z  1 eg R  Ks  5 usually called Extremely Red Objects EROs However
for the typical limiting uxes of near-IR surveys Ks  20  21 they have very
faint optical magnitudes R  25  26 already close to the spectroscopic limits
of 8-10m-class telescopes In addition for z  1 their main spectral features
eg the 4000 A break and HK absorptions fall in the very red part of the
observed spectra where the strong OH sky lines and the CCD fringing and low
quantum eciency make spectroscopy even more demanding

2 The K20 survey
The K20 survey is a project aimed at investigating galaxy evolution through deep
ESO VLT spectroscopy of a sample of 546 objects with Ks  20 selected from
two elds covering a total area of 52 arcmin2 The two elds are completely inde-
pendent and one of them is a sub-area of the Chandra Deep Field South Most
spectroscopy was done in the optical with FORS1 and FORS2 and designed
to reach the highest possible signal-to-noise ratio in the red ISAAC near-IR
spectroscopy was also done for a small fraction of the sample The multi-band
U BV RIzJ Ks imaging available for both elds was used to derive high-quality
photometric redshifts trained with the spectroscopic redshifts The nal sam-
ple covers a redshift range of 0  z  25 and the current redshift completeness
is 92 spectroscopic and 100 spectroscopic  photometric redshifts
The K20 survey represents a signicant improvement with respect to other
surveys for faint K-selected galaxies thanks to its high spectroscopic redshift
completeness the highest to date extended to very faint red objects the larger
sample the coverage of two elds and the availability of optimized photometric
redshifts We note here that the distribution of the sample over two independent
sky elds is a signicant advantage in reducing the eld-to-eld variation eects

3 Established results galaxy evolution to z  1
Overall the K20 and other recent near-IR surveys show that galaxies are char-
acterized by little evolution to z  1 so that the observed properties can be
mimicked by a pure luminosity evolution PLE-like scenario This is in con-
trast with the current CDM hierarchical merging models where the assembly
of galaxies occurs later than what is actually observed In particular
 For Ks  20 N z has a median redshift of zmed  08 and a high-z tail
extended beyond z  2 Current hierarchical models do not match the observed
redshift distribution 818 Fig2 but an improved treatment of the merging
processes is providing encouraging results 2925
 The rest-frame Ks-band luminosity function shows a mild luminosity evolu-
tion up to z  1 with a brightening of about 05 magnitudes Signicant density
evolution is ruled out up to z  1 112617 The high-luminosity tail at z  1
is dominated by red early-type galaxies 26 Current hierarchical models fail
in reproducing the shape and the evolution of the LF as they over-predict the
number of sub-L galaxies under-predict that of luminous galaxies and predict
a strong density evolution
 The rest-frame Ks-band luminosity density evolves slowly to z  1 with
Ksz  1  z037 and much slower than the UV luminosity density 26
 The properties of old EROs with Ks  20 at z  1 morphology spectra
luminosities ages stellar masses clustering imply the existence of a substantial
population of old a few Gyr passively evolving and fully assembled massive
spheroids which requires that major episodes of massive galaxy formation oc-
curred at least at zf orm  2 79 Their number density at z  1 is consistent

ing model dotted and dashed lines and a pure luminosity evolution PLE model
solid line The models refer to total magnitudes Ks  20 and are not corrected for
the average under-estimate of 02 magnitudes due to the photometric selection eects
evaluated in the K20 sample see 6 Including this bias in the models results in im-
proving the agreement with the PLE models and increasing the discrepancy with the
hierarchical models as shown in the inserted plot where the model of Menci et al
2002 for Ks  198 is compared to the observed z  1 tail of N z see 8
within 2 with that of local luminous ES0 galaxies Current hierarchical mod-
els severely under-predict the number of old EROs 79
 A numerous population of dusty star-forming EROs with disk-like and ir-
regular morphologies emerges at 07  z  17 from near-IR surveys 7289
These objects are often too faint to be detected in submm surveys due to their
inferred far-IR luminosities  1012 L and represent an ensemble of galaxies
important to complement other star-forming systems selected with dierent te-
chiniques They are also expected to be important contributors to the cosmic
Galaxy Evolution in Near-IR Surveys
star-formation density 79428 Also in this case current hierarchical models
under-estimate the number of dusty EROs
 Old EROs seem to have much stronger clustering than dusty EROs
with a comoving r0 similar to that of present-day luminous ellipticals 13
 The number density of massive galaxies and the cosmic stellar mass density
 show a slow decrease from z  0 to z  1 qualitatively consistent with a
hierarchical scenario but much slower than what the current models predict

4 Beyond z  1 galaxies in the redshift desert
At higher redshifts the picture becomes more controversial at z  1 the evolu-
tion of the near-IR luminosity function seems to depart from a PLE-like pattern
26 it is still not clear if the number density of old spheroids drops at z  13
127 and unexpected populations of massive star-forming galaxies are being
found in the range of 15  z  3 thanks to near-IR surveys 213114
Moreover the galaxy stellar mass function and z display a fast evolution
at z  1 1519 and the K20 survey results suggest a rapid increase of the stellar
mass density from 2020
10 of the local value at 2  z  3 to about 100 at
z  1 20
These results suggest that 15  z  25 may be the critical cosmic epoch
during which most star formation activity and galaxy mass assembly took place
However probing the 15  z  25 range is dicult due to the lack of strong
spectral features and emission lines redshifted in the observed optical and to the
strong OH emission sky lines severely aecting the spectra beyond 8000 A
Due to the limited number of spectroscopically identied galaxies this redshift
range has been traditionally called redshift desert
Thanks to the very deep red-optimized optical spectroscopy and to near-IR
spectroscopy the K20 survey allowed us to populate the redshift desert and
to unveil the nature of K-selected galaxies in this critical redshift range By
combining deep HSTACS imaging with K20 spectroscopy we found that a
variety of galaxy types are present at 15  z  25 spheroids at z  15 disk-
and spiral-like systems and many irregular merging-like objects
Particularly relevant is a sub-sample of luminous galaxies at 17  z  23
spectroscopically identied in the K20 survey 14 Their inferred star formation
rates of  100  500 Myr1 stellar masses up to 1011 M derived from the
tting of their multi-color spectral energy distributions and their merging-like
optical morphologies becoming more compact in the near-IR suggest that these
galaxies may be massive galaxies caught during their major episode of mass
assembly and star-formation possibly being the progenitors of the present-day
massive spheroidal systems Current semi-analytical models under-predict by a
factor of  30 the number density of such galaxies 1429 Other near-IR surveys
are independently nding candidate massive systems at z  2  3 2131
In order to draw a coherent picture of galaxy evolution at 15  z  25
it will be crucial to combine K-selected samples eg K20 FIRES 21 GDDS

22 with UV- and optically-selected samples more biased toward star-forming
objects with little dust extinction such as those resulting from the Lyman-break
selection at z  14 30
