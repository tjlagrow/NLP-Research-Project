Abstract 
Numerous transcription factors self-assemble into different order oligomeric species 
in a way that is actively regulated by the cell Until now no general functional role 
has  been  identified  for  this  widespread  process  Here  we  capture  the  effects  of 
modulated  self-assembly  in  gene  expression  with  a  novel  quantitative  framework 
We  show  that  this  mechanism  provides  precision  and  flexibility  two  seemingly 
antagonistic  properties  to  the  sensing  of  diverse  cellular  signals  by  systems  that 
share  common  elements  present  in  transcription  factors  like  p53  NF-B  STATs 
Oct  and  RXR  Applied  to  the  nuclear  hormone  receptor  RXR  this  framework 
accurately  reproduces  a  broad  range  of  classical  previously  unexplained  sets  of 
gene expression data and corroborates the existence of a precise functional regime 
with flexible properties that can be controlled both at a genome-wide scale and at 
the individual promoter level

INTRODUCTION 
A  recurrent  theme  in  gene  regulation  is  the  self-assembly  of  transcription  factors  TF 
into  coexisting  populations  of  dimers  tetramers  and  other  higher  order  oligomers  that 
can bind simultaneously single and multiple DNA sites This behavior has been observed 
explicitly  in  the  tumor  suppressor  p53  1  the  nuclear  factor  B    NF-B  23  the 
signal  transducers  and  activators  of  transcription  STATs  4  the  octamer-binding 
proteins  Oct  56  and  the  retinoid  nuclear  hormone  receptor  RXR  7  Table  1  In 
these  systems  the  properties  of  self-assembly  and  the  partitioning  into  low  and  high 
order  oligomeric  species  are  strongly  regulated  and  modulated  by  several  types  of 
signals  such  as  ligand  binding  8  protein  binding  910  acetylation  11  and 
phosphorylation  612  The  general  implications  of  this  modulation  however  are  not 
clear 
At the level of single DNA sites it is well established that the effects of TF are 
finely  determined  by  their  concentration  and  cognate  DNA  sequences  13  Processes 
based on interactions with different molecules and post-transcriptional modifications are 
assumed to affect mainly the DNA binding properties of the TFs or their ability to recruit 
coregulators This idea is entrenched in the field of gene regulation and is systematically 
used as a guiding principle in the ongoing development of molecular therapies against 
diverse  diseases  14  But  TFs  rarely  act  through  just  a  single  binding  site  615-21 
Table 1 Modulated self-assembly MSA provides a key mechanism for controlling the 
ability of TFs to bind two or more DNA sites simultaneously  
To  determine  the  common  wide-ranging  effects  of  MSA  we  have  developed  a 
general  quantitative  framework  that  accurately  links  MSA  with  control  of  gene 
expression Figure 1 It focuses on the general aspects of the core control mechanism 
shared by the wide variety of regulatory systems where MSA is present which include 
TF  self-assembly  and  its  modulation  binding  of  the  TF  oligomers  to  DNA  and  the 
resulting  transcriptional  responses  This  quantitative  framework  allowed  us  to  uncover 
modulation of the oligomeric states of TFs as a flexible mechanism for precise sensing of 
molecular signals in the presence of intracellular fluctuations Precision ensures that the 
transcriptional  response  is  consistently  triggered  at  a  given  modulator  signal  strength 
irrespective of the TF concentration Flexibility allows the precise triggering point to be 
changed  up  to  several  orders  of  magnitude  both  at  the  individual  promoter  level  by 
changing its DNA sequence and at a genome-wide scale by changing the molecular self-
assembly properties  
This methodology identified a core set of features needed to implement control of 
transcription by MSA that are present in a wide variety of structurally different systems 
Table 1 As an exemplar of these systems we have considered explicitly the nuclear 
hormone receptor RXR In this case the quantitative framework accurately reproduced 
in  some  instances  even  without  free  parameters  a  broad  range  of  classical  previously 
unexplained  gene  expression  experimental  data  and  demonstrated  how  flexible  precise 
control  of  gene  expression  can  be  achieved  directly  at  the  molecular  level  through 
modulation of the oligomerization state of transcriptional regulators 
MATHERIALS AND METHODS 
The  first  step  in  the  signaling  cascade  orchestrated  by  MSA  is  the  regulation  of  the 
relative abundance of the oligomerization states of the TF Figure 1 The self-assembly 
modulator such as a ligand that binds to a TF or a kinase that phosphorylates the TF 
affects the low-order oligomers to promote or prevent their self-assembly We consider 
2n  as relevant high 
explicitly tetramers 
and low order oligomeric species Other oligomerization pairs such as octamer-tetramers 
or dimer-monomers are mathematically equivalent to tetramer-dimers  
function 
We  quantitate  the  effects  of  self-assembly  modulation  through  the  modulator 
 which describes in terms of concentrations the partitioning 
2n  and non-tetramerizing dimers 
4n  dimers 
into the tetramerizing and non-tetramerizing dimers by the self-assembly modulator  s  
This process affects dimer and tetramer concentrations which are related to each other

The  precise  form  of  the  modulator  function  is  given  by  the  specific  mode  of 
s K  for a ligand  s  that upon 
binding to the dimer 
2n  with dissociation constant 
ligK  renders it unable to tetramerize 
in  the  form

  for  phosphorylation  in  the  linear  regime  of  the  non-
tetramerizing 
2n   into  the  tetramerizing 
concentration  of  active  kinases  and 
2n   dimer  species  In  this  case   s   is  the 
  are  the  phosphorylation  and 
dephosphorylation  rate  constants  respectively    In  general  several  mechanisms  can  be 
involved at the same time in controlling the oligomerization properties For instance the 
case in which the two previous processes are combined so that the dimer has to be both 
free  of  ligand  and  phosphorylated  to  be  able  to  tetramerize  leads  to  a  two-variable 
modulator

 is the concentration of active kinases 
Binding  of  the  different  TF  oligomers  to  the  DNA  sites  mediates  the 
transcriptional effects of the self-assembly modulator Figure 1 Typically tetramers and 
both types of dimers bind single DNA sites in a very similar way with free energies 
 for site 1 and 2 respectively These quantities are related to the corresponding 
dissociation constants through 
  Tetramers in 
addition  can  bind  two  sites  simultaneously  because  they  have  two  DNA  binding 
domains one from each of its two constituent dimers which contribute with 
  to  the  free  energy  The  simultaneous  binding  of  two  domains  is  typically 
accompanied by conformational changes eg twisting and bending in both the tetramer 
 to the 
and DNA 2223 which contributes with an additional conformational term

studied in detail in the case of DNA looping by prokaryotic TFs and is dependent among 
others on the TF and DNA flexibility the relative position of the DNA binding sites and 
the DNA supercoiling state 2223 
We use statistical thermodynamics to quantitatively describe binding to DNA in 
terms of free energies and concentrations of the different oligomeric species 24-26 The

statistical  weight  or  Boltzmann 
factor  defined  as 
 which relates the relative probability of the binding state  i  
  The  exponents 
im   correspond  to  the 
number of tetramers dimers and non-tetramerizing dimers in the state  i  respectively 
The factor  RT  is the gas constant  R  times the absolute temperature T  The probability 
Z   is  obtained  by  adding  the 
of  a  given  group  of  binding  states  c  
id   and 
statistical weights of its states and normalizing by the sum for all the possible states 
For a system with two binding sites there are 17 binding states Figure 1 These 
states are those with both sites empty one occupied by a dimer or a tetramer two sites 
occupied  by  two  dimers  by  two  tetramers  or  a  dimer  and  tetramer  and  two  sites 
occupied simultaneously by a single tetramer In the case of states with dimers one has to 
take  into  account  that  a  dimer  can  either  be  in  the  form  that  allows  or  prevents 
tetramerization  In  general  each  binding  state  includes  a  constellation  of  molecular 
substates with different DNA conformations For instance the state with both sites empty 
can include a bent DNA conformation as in the case when the two sites are occupied 
simultaneously  by  a  single  tetramer  but  the  lack  of  a  tetramer  to  stabilize  the 
conformation  makes  this  conformation  highly  unlikely  This  type  of  effects  has  been 
described in detail for other TF that bind two DNA sites simultaneously such as the lac 
repressor 27  
There is also the possibility that oligomerization is so weak in solution that it is 
only observed on DNA This effect can be put in quantitative terms with our framework 
by considering that the state with the tetramer bound simultaneously to two DNA sites 
Figure  1  can  also  be  described  as  two  interacting  dimers  that  bind  cooperatively  to 
DNA The statistical weight of this state is given by 
  
 in terms of 
tetramer  concentration  and  by 
  
  in  terms  of  dimer 
concentration  which 
can  be 
rewritten 
  with 
G RT K   Thus  a  very  high  dissociation  constant  that  does  not  lead  to 
significant  tetramerization  in  solution  is  sufficient  to  promote  tetramerization  on  DNA 
when  the  conformational  free  energy  is  sufficiently  low  Intuitively  tetramerization  is 
Two differentiated types of transcriptional responses can be constructed from the 
observed on DNA because binding to DNA brings the tetramerization domains close to 
each other and increases their local concentration 
binding states of the TF on DNA Figure 1  
The  first  type  referred  to  as  response  R1  involves  a  high  order  oligomer  that 
simultaneously  binds  two  non-adjacent  DNA  sites  Upon  binding  the  high-order 
oligomer loops out the intervening DNA and positions a distal enhancer in the vicinity of 
tP   of  the  state  with  the

The second type denoted here response R2 takes advantage of the differentiated 
recruitment abilities of different oligomerization states This mode of regulation applies 
to  a  coactivator  that  is  recruited  by  a  low-order  oligomer  by  binding  to  a  molecular 
surface  that  is  occluded  in  the  high-order  oligomer  In  this  case  the  effective

Responses R1 and R2 embrace the prototypical cases mediated by long and short 
range  interactions  between  regulatory  elements  They  are  controlled  by  the  relative 
occupancy  of  DNA  binding  sites  by  the  different  oligomeric  species  This  mode  of 
functioning differs from other systems with multiple binding sites like the lac operon 
which  are  controlled  by  the  absolute  occupancy  of  their  sites  by  a  single  oligomeric 
species  28  For  instance  IPTG  an  inducer  of  the  lac  operon  does  not  affect  the 
oligomerization state of the tetrameric lac repressor but prevents each of its two DNA 
binding domains from significantly binding their cognate sites 2829  
RESULTS 
To uncover the unique characteristics that emerge from the core structure of MSA in such 
a  general  wide  variety  of  structurally  different  systems  Table  1  we  focus  on  a 
functional regime that guarantees that there is response to changes in the self-assembly 
modulator concentration This regime considers two properties The first one is that the 
TF concentration is sufficiently high for it to significantly bind DNA In mathematical 
terms it implies 
 G RT
 G RT
  The  second 
one is that the tetramer concentration is sufficiently low 
n  so that they 
do not to take completely over the binding The reason is that for typical values of 
tetramers bind more strongly to two DNA sites simultaneously than dimers do to a single 
DNA site 273031  
The key implication of this regime is that the probabilities of the different groups 
of binding states simplify in such a way see Table 2 that the transcriptional responses 
are governed by the reduced expressions 
  
  
which show that responses R1 and R2 despite being mechanistically different follow the 
same control logics In both cases the two-site binding of the tetramer quantified by 
determines the contributions of the reference and activated transcriptional states The end 
tP  imparts precision and 
result is even more remarkable because the particular form of 
flexibility  to  the  transcriptional  responses  two  properties  that  are  the  cornerstone  of 
natural gene expression systems but that have proved to be highly elusive because of their 
seemingly antagonistic character 13 
Precision  ensures  that  the  transcriptional  response  is  consistently  triggered  at  a 
given  modulator  signal  strength  irrespective  of  the  particular  TF  concentration  which 
cancels out in the reduced equations that govern the system behavior Flexibility on the 
other  hand  allows  the  precise  triggering  point  to  be  altered  up  to  several  orders  of 
magnitude  both  at  the  individual  promoter  level  by  changing  its  organization   o
depends on the distance between the two DNA binding sites 1722 and at a genome-
tdK  affect 
wide scale by changing the molecular self-assembly properties   
the regulation of all genes in the same way  
All these results can be observed explicitly in the retinoid X receptor RXR an 
exemplar  of  the  essential  regulators  that  share  the  central  features  of  MSA  Table  1  
RXR controls a large number of genes by binding to DNA as homodimer homotetramer 
or  obligatory  heterodimerization  partner  for  other  nuclear  receptors  Nuclear  retinoid 
receptors are highly significant because they mediate the pleiotropic effects of retinoic 
acid  which  include  cell  proliferation  differentiation  and  embryonic  development  and 
affect the carcinogenic process in a number of organs 32 
The canonical self-assembly modulator of RXR is the hormone 9-cis-retinoic acid 
9cRA a derivative of Vitamin A which binds each RXR subunit independently of its 
oligomerization  state  33  and  prevents  dimers  with  their  two  subunits  occupied  from 
tetramerazing 8 This behavior is consistent with 
being a holo-dimer as observed in the respective crystal structures of the dimers with no 
ligand bound 34 and with two ligands bound 35 The crystal structure of one tetramer 
with two ligands bound 36 shows that two dimers with just one ligand each can form 
tetramers with a structure similar to those of two apo-dimers In addition to 9cRA there 
are  other  ligands  of  RXR  as  for  instance  the  oleic  acid  docosahexaenoic  acid 
methoprene acid and phytanic acid 35  
These early steps in sensing 9cRA and other ligand concentrations are taken into 
account by the explicit form of the modulator function which we obtain from the mass 
action law as  
2n  being an apo-dimer and with 
ligK   and   s   are  the  ligand-RXR  dissociation  constant  and  the  ligand 
concentration respectively see Supplementary Methods  
To  compare  with  the  experimental  data  we  normalize  the  fold  induction  a 
measure of relative changes in transcriptional activity so that its variation ranges from 0 
to 1 This quantity referred to as normalized fold induction NFI is defined explicitly as 
 is maximum value of the fold induction  FI   In 
 where 
terms  of  the  NFI  the  results  do  not  depend  on  parameters  related  to  the  baseline  and 
maximum expression levels and it becomes possible to effectively compare experiments 
on different promoters and cell lines see Supplementary Methods The only parameters 
ligK  and 
needed to characterize the shape of the response in the functional regime are 
  which  can  be  inferred  by 
tdK   which  have  been  measured  experimentally  and 
adjusting its value to reproduce the experimental data 
This  approach  accurately  describes  the  experimental  observations  16  for  the 
ligand 9cRA and a promoter with two non-adjacent DNA binding sites for RXR and a 
distal enhancer Figure 2A Simultaneous binding of an RXR tetramer to the two sites 
loops  out  the  intervening  DNA  and  brings  the  enhancer  close  to  the  promoter  region 
response  R1  Increasing  the  concentration  of  9cRA  prevents  the  formation  of  RXR 
tetramers and leads to deactivation of transcription  
The very same approach also captures in detail the observed behavior when the 
two DNA binding sites are next to each other as in the classic set of experiments that 
uncovered  9cRA  as  the  cognate  ligand  of  RXR  for  different  promoters  and  cell  lines 
Figure 2B In these cases only the dimeric forms of RXR with ligand bound can recruit 
a  coactivator  response  R2  and  increasing  the  concentration  of  9cRA  results  in  the 
activation  of  transcription  The  extent  of  activation  is  modulated  by  the  RXR  AF-1 
domain and RXR phosphorylation 37-39

This  framework  has  the  much-sought  ability  to  fully  predict  without  free 
  obtained  in 
response to just a single ligand Applied to the all-trans retinoic acid atRA which was 
tested  early  on  as  a  potential  cognate  ligand  of  RXR  4041  the  approach  closely 
recapitulates its effects on transcription for different cell types and promoters from the 
values of 
 inferred in the responses to 9cRA Figure 2C This ability to fully predict 
responses  without  free  parameters  is  especially  important  because  it  provides  a  direct 
avenue  to  transfer  specific  molecular  information  of  the  ligand-TF  interaction  as 
described by the measured or computed parameters across scales up to the transcriptional 
effects  
The high variability of the transcriptional responses as observed in Figure 2 has 
been  a  long-standing  recurrent  issue  in  RXR  gene  regulation  In  particular  the  half-
maximum response point characterized by the EC50 ranges from just above the RXR-
ligand  dissociation  constant  up  to  values  30-fold  higher  Table  3  Our  results  have 
identified  MSA  as  a  potential  mechanism  to  control  the  EC50  at  the  single-gene  level 
 Table 3 This promoter-dependent flexibility indicates that 
through the value of 
for  these  systems  the  observed  variability  is  not  a  random  aspect  of  the  experimental 
setup but the result of RXR precisely tailoring the response to each individual gene 
The  observed  variability  can  be  collapsed  in  the  form  of  response  landscapes 
Figure 3 which represent the transcriptional activity as a function of the conformational 
free energy in addition to just the usual ligand concentration of dose-response curves The 
landscapes explicitly show the ability of RXR to shape the molecular response to ligand 
binding  in  a  promoter-dependent  way  The  response  landscapes  show  how  the  EC50 
increases as the conformational free energy decreases in a way that closely matches the 
experimental observations Figure 3

functional regime the whole-parameter space includes the experimentally measured free 
energies  of  binding  to  DNA  the  RXR  dimer-monomer  dissociation  constant  and  the 
nuclear  RXR  concentration  The  results  Figure  4  are  virtually  independent  of  the 
precise  value  of  the  total  nuclear  RXR  protein  concentration  over  at  least  a  10-fold 
range  and  accurately  capture  the  diverse  dose-response  curves  observed  in  the 
experiments  in  agreement  with  the  results  for  the  functional  regime  In  all  cases  the 
ranges  of  concentrations  include  550  nM  the  estimated  RXR  nuclear  concentration  in 
HL-60  cells  7  Therefore  the  ability  to  elicit  flexible  and  precise  responses  as 
uncovered  in  the  general  analysis  is  also  present  when  the  particularities  of  RXR-
mediated transcriptional responses are taken into account 
DISCUSSION 
Cellular processes rely on intricate molecular mechanisms to function in extraordinarily 
diverse intra- and extra-cellular environments Eukaryotic gene expression in particular 
has  shown  to  be  exceedingly  complex  42-44  Just  the  core  of  the  transcriptional 
machinery  itself  involves  a  wide  variety  of  components  with  oscillatory  patterns  of 
macromolecular assembly and phosphorylation 45 On top of the constitutive processes 
there  are  many  other  molecular  interactions  that  provide  regulation  enhancing  or 
reducing  gene  expression  and  adjusting  to  changing  cellular  conditions  46  To 
understand how these different levels of molecular complexity contribute to the observed 
behavior one needs the right approaches 4748  
The  quantitative  framework  we  have  developed  provides  an  efficient  avenue  to 
connect  the  molecular  properties  of  MSA  with  its  effects  in  the  control  of  gene 
expression This framework allowed us to uncover unique properties of control of gene 
expression by MSA that lead to a flexible mechanism for precise sensing of diverse types 
of  self-assembly  modulation  signals  irrespective  of  changes  in  transcription  factor 
concentration  Application  of  this  methodology  to  the  nuclear  hormone  receptor  RXR 
accurately  describes  the  experimentally  observed  transcriptional  responses  for  both 
enhancers  response  R1  and  coactivators  response  R2  from  just  the  molecular 
properties of the components Figures 2A and 2B and successfully predicts the observed 
behavior without free parameters Figure 2C A detailed analysis of the whole-parameter 
space reveals that regulation by RXR is functioning in a precise regime with minimal 
dependence on RXR nuclear concentration Figure 4 in which the responses are highly 
diverse as a result of the inherent flexibility that accompanies precision in the control of 
gene expression by MSA Figure 3 
The  observed  TF-concentration  insensitivity  of  control  of  gene  expression  by 
MSA contrasts with the traditional role of RXR as obligatory heterodimerization partner 
for other nuclear receptors which relies on the absolute occupancy of the cognate binding 
sites  by  the  heterodimer  In  the  case  of  RXRPPAR  regulation  of  adipogenesis 
however it has been observed that several promoters are controlled rather by the relative 
occupancy between RXRPPAR heterodimers and other RXR heterodimers or homo-
oligomers 49 Our framework provides a starting point to consider these more complex 
situations by coupling MSA with hetero-oligomerization and to combine these extensions 
with  recent  bioinformatics  methods  5051  to  make  accurate  predictions  on  gene 
expression based on the binding profiles observed in the experimental data 49 
The  combined  presence  of  flexibility  and  precision  in  the  control  of  gene 
expression by MSA as explicitly shown for RXR allows a single TF to simultaneously 
regulate  multiple  genes  with  promoter-tailored  dose-response  curves  that  consistently 
maintain their diverse shapes for a broad range of the TF concentration changes These 
features  are  especially  important  because  essential  TFs  like  p53  NF-B  STATs  Oct 
and RXR each of which have all the core elements that form the backbone of control of 
gene expression by MSA regulate multiple genes that engage in processes as diverse as 
cancer  inflammation  autoimmune  diseases  and  cellular  differentiation  These  results 
indicate  that  the  prospects  for  devising  more  effective  molecular  therapies  for  systems 
controlled by MSA will greatly benefit from shifting potential intervention points from 
those that affect absolute concentrations and single-site binding to those that can tackle 
concentration ratios and promoter properties

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS 
Normalized fold induction for response R1 
In  the  case  of  an  enhancer  being  brought  to  the  promoter  the  fold  induction  and 
maximum  fold  induction  are 
FI  
   and 
which lead to a normalized fold induction given by 
   
  respectively 
Therefore in the case of response R1 the normalized fold induction is determined by just 
the probability of the conformation with the tetramer bound to the two DNA sites 
Normalized fold induction for response R2 
The  case  of  a  coactivator  being  recruited  by  an  active  RXR  dimer  is  more  involved 
because the self-assembly modulator 9cRA is also an agonist of RXR The reason is that 
an RXR dimer has to bind at least one 9cRA molecule to recruit a coactivator Therefore 
the  quantities  c   see  text  are  themselves  effective  transcription  rates  given  by 
  
no ligand
no ligand
  where 
no ligand
  is  the  probability  that  none  of  the 
dimers  of  the  group  of  binding  states  c   has  a  ligand  bound  It  is  given  by 
no ligand

 for the groups of binding states with one dimer od and do and 
no ligand

  for  the  group  of  binding  states  with  the  two  dimers  dd

 depend explicitly on the self-assembly 
modulator concentration and take into account that binding of at least one ligand to RXR 
activates  the  dimeric  form  in  addition  to  modulating  the  oligomerization  state    In  the 
case of response R2 therefore we have 
FI  
  and 
 and the 
resulting normalized fold induction is given by

in the functional regime 
Modulator function for RXR 
The  self-assembly  modulator  of  RXR  is  the  hormone  9-cis-retinoic  acid    9cRA  a 
derivative  of  Vitamin  A  which  binds  each  RXR  molecule  independently  of  its 
oligomerization  state  and  prevents  dimers  with  their  two  subunits  occupied  from 
tetramerazing  Therefore  there  are  several  types  of  tetramerizing  dimers  We  use  the 
notation 
 for the dimer concentration with no hormone bound 
those with just one 9cRA molecule bound and 
 for those with two 9cRA molecules 
bound Binding of 9cRA to RXR follows the usual mass action law 
  and 
  where 
ligand-RXR 
dissociation constant The concentrations of tetramerazing and non-tetramerazing dimers 
are therefore related to each other by 
2  
from which we obtain the explicit form of the modulator function  
This expression explicitly indicates how the ligand controls the relative concentrations of 
the different oligomerization states that shape the transcriptional response 
Computational approach for RXR in the whole-parameter space 
The  whole-parameter  space  needs  to  consider  explicitly  the  total  nuclear  RXR 
concentration 
n   which  includes  the  contributions  from 
monomer  concentration 
n   in  addition  to  those  from  the  tetramer  dimer  and  non-
tetramerizing dimer Dimerization is described by 
K  where 
dmK  is 
dimer-monomer  dissociation  constant  For  given  values  of  the  parameters  the 
concentrations of the four oligomerization states are obtained by solving numerically the 
equations  for  the  total  nuclear  RXR  concentration  dimerization  tetramerization  and 
modulator 
function 
for  each 
ligand  concentration  The 
resulting  oligomeric 
concentrations are used to obtain the corresponding probabilities Table 2 which in turn
