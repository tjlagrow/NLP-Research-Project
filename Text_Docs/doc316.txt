Draft version February 5 2008
ABSTRACT
We model the luminosity-dependent projected two-point correlation function of DEEP2 and SDSS
galaxies within the Halo Occupation Distribution HOD framework From this we infer the rela-
tionship between galaxy luminosity and host dark matter halo mass at z  1 and at z  0 At
both epochs there is a tight correlation between central galaxy luminosity and halo mass with the
slope and scatter decreasing for larger halo masses and the fraction of satellite galaxies decreasing
at higher luminosity Central L galaxies reside in halos a few times more massive at z  1 than
at z  0 The satellite fraction of galaxies more luminous than L is 10 at z  1 compared to
20 at z  0 We nd little evolution in the relation between the characteristic minimum mass
of a halo hosting a central galaxy above a luminosity threshold and the mass scale of a halo that on
average hosts one satellite galaxy above the same luminosity threshold with the latter being 1520
times the former Combining these HOD results with theoretical predictions of the typical growth of
halos we establish an evolutionary connection between the galaxy populations at the two redshifts
by linking z  0 central galaxies to z  1 central galaxies that reside in their progenitor halos which
enables us to study the evolution of galaxies as a function of halo mass We nd that the stellar mass
growth of galaxies depends on halo mass On average the majority of the stellar mass in central
galaxies residing in z  0 low-mass halos  5  1011h1M is the result of star formation between
z  1 and z  0 while only a small fraction of the stellar mass in central galaxies of high mass
halos  1013h1M is the result of star formation over this period In addition the mass scale
of halos where the star formation eciency reaches a maximum is found to shift toward lower mass
with time With appropriately dened galaxy samples at dierent redshifts future work can combine
HOD modeling of the clustering with the assembly history and dynamical evolution of dark matter
halos This can lead to an understanding of the stellar mass growth due to both mergers and star
formation as a function of host halo mass and provide powerful tests of galaxy formation theories
In the appendix we provide a brief discussion of systematic biases related to the assumption of one
galaxy per halo in estimating the mass scale and number density of host halos from the observed
clustering strength of galaxies

1 INTRODUCTION
The spatial clustering of galaxies encodes useful in-
formation about their formation and evolution which
remain outstanding problems in modern cosmology and
astrophysics Large redshift surveys at dierent epochs
have enabled detailed studies of galaxy clustering and
its evolution In particular the dependence of clustering
on galaxy properties such as luminosity and color pro-
vides fundamental constraints on galaxy formation theo-
ries In this paper we model the luminosity-dependence
of the galaxy two-point correlation functions at z  1
and z  0 measured for galaxies in the DEEP2 Galaxy
Redshift Survey Coil et al 2006a and the Sloan Digi-
tal Sky Survey SDSS Zehavi et al 2005 to investigate
the evolution of galaxies over the last 7 billion years

To make full use of the galaxy clustering measurements
to test galaxy formation theories one needs to extract
and characterize the information available in the clus-
tering data in a convenient and informative form
the cold dark matter CDM hierarchical structure for-
mation paradigm the evolution of galaxies is coupled to
that of the dark matter halos dened as roughly spheri-
cal virialized regions with over-density about 200 times
that of the mean background density The formation
and evolution of dark matter halos are dominated by
gravity and with the help of improving computational
power and N -body simulations can be calculated ac-
curately for any specied cosmological model Galaxy
clustering data are particularly illuminating if one can
relate galaxies to dark matter halos in a way that results
in informative tests of galaxy formation theory This
can be achieved within the framework of the halo oc-
cupation distribution HOD which describes the sta-
tistical relation between galaxies and dark matter ha-

Recently much eort has also

plain the clustering properties of these high redshift
galaxies

Cooray 2005 2006 Cooray  Ouchi 2006 Conroy et al
2006 White et al 2007 Blake et al 2007 Galaxy clus-
tering data at dierent redshifts provide a goldmine of
information from which to deepen our understanding of
galaxy evolution As an example White et al 2007
nd evidence for merging or disruption of red galaxies in
NDWFS from modeling the evolution of their clustering
Recent studies of galaxy luminosity functions and two-
point correlation functions at dierent redshifts with the
CLF approach also reveal some interesting evolutionary
trends such as a brightening of the luminosity of cen-
tral galaxies at a xed halo mass toward higher redshifts
eg Cooray 2005
As galaxies evolve they grow in both stellar and
dark matter mass Their stellar component continuously
changes as the original stars age and new stars form
Galaxies can also change their stellar contents and in-
crease their mass as a result of mergers with other galax-
ies Dierent feedback or pre-heating mechanisms such
as those caused by star formation active galactic nu-
clei or the photo-ionizing ultra-violet background can
also impact at dierent stages of a galaxys life Var-
ious evolutionary processes can change galaxy proper-
ties such as luminosity color mass and morphology To
observationally establish a connection between galaxy
populations at dierent redshifts is therefore not triv-
ial Much of the work to identify progenitors or de-
scendants of certain galaxy types from galaxy cluster-
ing has been based on rather simple models with limited
constraining power such as the object-conserving or the
merging model Matarrese et al 1997 Moscardini et al
1998 By contrast the HOD framework converts the ob-
served galaxy clustering data to a relation between galax-
ies and their host dark matter halos placing galaxies in
a cosmological context Using HOD constraints at dier-
ent redshifts derived from clustering data thus provides
a physically motivated way to study galaxy evolution
The evolution of the HOD reects how the relation be-
tween galaxies and halos changes with time which can
be used to test galaxy formation models in a more trans-
parent way The evolution of dark matter halos can be
solved with analytic approaches eg Taylor  Babul
2001 2004 Benson et al 2002 Oguri  Lee 2004
van den Bosch et al 2005 Zentner et al 2005 and cos-
mological simulations eg Springel et al 2005 Thus
the HOD evolution may potentially provide valuable con-
straints on the evolution of baryons in galaxies eg
accretion and consumption of gas formation of stars
and put powerful tests on galaxy formation theories
Many recent studies of galaxy evolution have mea-
sured specic galaxy properties eg the star forma-
tion rate or the star formation history as a function
of the mass of the galaxy where either the stellar mass
or an estimate of the dynamical mass is used eg
Heavens et al 2004 Jimenez et al 2005 Juneau et al
2005 Bundy et al 2006 Cimatti et al 2006 Erb et al
2006ab Jimenez et al 2006 Noeske et al 2007ab
Zheng et al 2007 The unique aspect of the approaches
presented and envisioned in this paper that make use of
HOD modeling of galaxy clustering at dierent redshifts
is that we are able to study the evolution of galaxy prop-
erties as a function of the host dark matter halo mass
which is a fundamental parameter in galaxy formation
and evolution
In this paper we perform HOD modeling of the lu-
minosity dependence of the galaxy two-point correlation
function for samples at two epochs the z  1 DEEP2
galaxies and the z  0 SDSS galaxies to study the evolu-
tion of the HOD and its implication for galaxy formation
models The structure of the paper is as follows In  2
we briey describe the DEEP2 and SDSS galaxy samples
used here We dene our cosmological model and intro-
duce the HOD parameterization in  3 The modeling
results are presented in  4 In  5 we make a detailed
comparison between the HODs at the two epochs
 6 we attempt to establish an evolutionary link between
the two galaxy populations through the growth of dark
matter halos This allows us to infer the evolution of
galaxies as a function of the host halo mass during the
last 7 billion years We also discuss the star formation
eciency at the two epochs Finally in  7 we sum-
marize our results and discuss how to extend the study
in this paper to a powerful comprehensive program to
constrain galaxy formation and evolution theories For
a simple estimate instead of using a full HOD model-
ing some applications of galaxy clustering assume one
galaxy per halo In the Appendix we use an HOD model
to investigate the potential systematic errors introduced
by this assumption
2 GALAXY SAMPLES
21 DEEP2 Samples
We use the projected two-point correlation functions
measured by Coil et al 2006a for luminosity threshold
galaxy samples from the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Sur-
vey to constrain the HOD at z  1 The DEEP2 survey
uses DEIMOS Faber et al 2003 on the 10-m Keck II
telescope to survey optical galaxies at z  1 in a comov-
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
ing volume of approximately 5106 h3Mpc3 DEEP2
has measured redshifts for  30 000 galaxies in the red-
shift range 07  z  145 to a limiting magnitude of
RAB  241 over 3 deg2 of the sky Technical details of
the DEEP2 survey can be found in Davis et al 2003
and Davis Gerke  Newman 2004
Here we use the four nearly volume-limited samples of
Coil et al 2006a dened by thresholds in rest-frame
Johnson B absolute magnitude MB K-corrections are
calculated as described in Willmer et al 2006 and no
corrections are made for luminosity evolution Each sam-
ple has a minimum redshift of z  075 and a maximum
redshift of z  10  12 depending on luminosity and
includes 500011000 galaxies The three brightest sam-
ples MB  205 MB  200 and MB  195 are
volume-limited for blue galaxies while the faintest sam-
ple MB  190 is missing some fainter blue galax-
ies at 095  z  10 The samples are not entirely
volume-limited for red galaxies due to the RAB selec-
tion of the DEEP2 survey for denitions of blue and
red galaxies and a discussion of this selection eect see
Willmer et al 2006 By assuming little evolution in the
red galaxy fraction at z  1 and using a volume-limited
but smaller control sample at a slightly lower redshift
we estimate that for each sample about 10 of the full
population is missed because of the red galaxies being not
volume-limited We address the impact of this sample se-
lection on the galaxy evolution we attempt to establish
in  6
22 SDSS Samples
We compare the DEEP2 clustering and modeling re-
sults to those obtained from the SDSS at lower redshifts
The SDSS York et al 2000 Stoughton et al 2002 is
an ongoing project that aims to map nearly one quar-
ter of the sky in the northern Galactic cap as well as
a small portion of the southern Galactic cap using a
dedicated 25m telescope Gunn et al 2006 A drift-
scanning mosaic CCD camera Gunn et al 1998 is used
to image the sky in ve photometric bandpasses to a
limiting magnitude of r  225 Objects are selected
for spectroscopic follow-up using specic algorithms for
the main galaxy sample Strauss et al 2002 luminous
red galaxy sample Eisenstein et al 2001 and quasars
Richards et al 2002 To a good approximation the
main galaxy sample consists of all galaxies with Pet-
rosian magnitude r  1777 with a median redshift of
 01 The construction of the large-scale structure sam-
ples is described in detail in Blanton et al 2005 The
radial selection function is derived from the sample se-
lection criteria using the K-corrections of Blanton et al
2003a and an improved version of the evolving luminos-
ity function model of Blanton et al 2003b The angu-
lar completeness is characterized carefully for each sector
a unique region of overlapping spectroscopic plates on
the sky
We use here the clustering results presented in
Zehavi et al 2005 for an SDSS sample containing some
200 000 galaxies extending over  2500 deg2 on the sky
More specically we use the projected two-point cor-
relation function measurements for volume-limited sam-
ples dened by thresholds in r-band absolute magnitude
Mr These luminosity threshold samples span a red-
shift range of 002  z  022 Zehavi et al 2005 have
also performed detailed HOD modeling of these cluster-
ing measurements We build on these results although
in order to facilitate a more direct comparison to the
DEEP2 modeling presented here we repeat the SDSS
HOD modeling with a slightly dierent and more exi-
ble suite of models used in this work
The SDSS and the DEEP2 surveys have dierent sam-
ple selections with SDSS galaxies selected in rest-frame
r-band and DEEP2 galaxies in rest-frame B-band The
dierences in the selection complicate the comparison of
the HOD modeling results a point we address through-
out the paper
3 COSMOLOGY AND HOD MODELS
31 Cosmology and Halo Properties
We adopt a spatially-at CDM cosmological model
with Gaussian initial density uctuations that is consis-
tent with the determination from the cosmic microwave
background Type Ia supernovae and galaxy cluster-
ing eg Spergel et al 2003 2007 Riess et al 2004
Tegmark et al 2004 Abazajian et al 2005 Density pa-
rameters are assumed to be m  b03 07
0047 where m  and b are density parame-
ters of the matter CDMbaryons dark energy and
baryons respectively The mass uctuation power spec-
trum is the primordial power spectrum with the spec-
tral index assumed to be ns1 modied by the trans-
fer function which is computed using the formula given
by Eisenstein  Hu 1998 with the eect of baryons
taken into account It is normalized such that the rms
uctuation of the linear density in spheres of radius
8h1Mpc at z0 is 809 The Hubble constant is
H0  100h  70 km s1Mpc1
We dene a dark matter halo as an object with mean
density of 200 times that of the background universe
With the assumed cosmological model properties of dark
matter halos are calculated based on numerically tested
tting formulas The halo mass function is computed
according to the formula given by Jenkins et al 2001
For the large-scale halo bias factor we adopt the for-
mula in Tinker et al 2005 which is a modication of
that given by Sheth et al 2001 and is accurate for a
large range of cosmological parameters The density
distribution of a dark matter halo of mass M is as-
sumed to follow the Navarro-Frenk-White NFW pro-
le Navarro Frenk  White 1995 1996 1997 charac-
terized by the concentration parameter cM  For cM 
we use the relation given by Bullock et al 2001 mod-
ied to be consistent with our halo denition
cM  
MM
where c0  11   013 and M is the nonlinear
mass at z  0 M  777 1012h1M for the adopted
cosmology
32 HOD Parameterization
It has proven to be useful
to parameterize the
HOD by separating contributions from central and
satellite galaxies through studies of subhalo HODs
in high-resolution dissipationless N body simulations
Kravtsov et al 2004 and galaxy HODs in semi-analytic
galaxy formation model SA and in smoothed particle
Zheng Coil  Zehavi
hydrodynamics SPH simulations Zheng et al 2005
For galaxy samples dened by lower luminosity thresh-
olds a simple parameterization of the mean occupation
function has three parameters eg Kravtsov et al 2004
Zheng et al 2005 Zehavi et al 2005  the mean oc-
cupation function hNcenM i of central galaxies can be
represented by a step-like function with a characteris-
tic minimum halo mass Mmin and the mean occupation
function hNsatM i of satellite galaxies is approximated
by a power law with the amplitude and slope as two free
parameters This simple three-parameter model can cap-
ture the basic features in the mean occupation function
predicted by galaxy formation models
However there are some advantages in choosing a
parametrization more exible than the simple one For
example at lower halo mass the mean occupation func-
tion of satellites predicted by galaxy formation models
drops faster than the extrapolation of the high mass
power law Kravtsov et al 2004 Zheng et al 2005
Since in the low-mass range satellites have a substan-
tial contribution to the galaxy two-point correlation func-
tion with the simple three-parameter model the best-t
power law slope in the satellite mean occupation func-
tion tends to reect the eective slope in the low-mass
range eg Zehavi et al 2005 That is the overall slope
is adjusted to t the amplitude of hNsati in the low-mass
range and it may become a poor description for the slope
at high halo mass
In this paper we adopt a slightly more exible parame-
terization with ve parameters motivated by the results
presented in Zheng et al 2005 The mean occupation
function of the central galaxies is a step-like function
with a soft cuto prole to account for the scatter be-
tween galaxy luminosity and host halo mass That of
the satellite galaxies is a power law modied by a low-
mass cuto prole in better agreement with predictions
of galaxy formation models This more exible parame-
terization includes two parameters for the mean occupa-
tion function of central galaxies and three for that of the
satellite galaxies which are described in detail below
The mean occupation function of central galaxies is a
step-like function parameterized by
hNcenM i 
2cid201  erfcid18 log M  log Mmin
log M
where erf is the error function
cid19cid21 
erfx 
 Z x
There are two free parameters Mmin the characteristic
minimum mass of halos that can host central galaxies
above the luminosity threshold and log M  the width
of the cuto prole Note that Mmin here can be in-
terpreted as the mass of such halos for which half of
them host galaxies above the given luminosity thresh-
old ie hNcenMmini  05 It is not identical to those
used in three-parameter models eg Zehavi et al 2005
hNcenMmini  1e for an exponential cuto prole and
hNceni changes from 0 to 1 at Mmin for a sharp cuto
prole Nevertheless in all cases Mmin characterizes the
minimum mass scales of the host halos
In the three-
parameter model hNcenM i which uses one parameter
Mmin can also have a soft cuto prole eg an expo-
nential prole as in Zehavi et al 2005 However the
two parameters Mmin and log M of the cuto prole in
equation 2 have a more physical meaning To see this
we briey review the derivation of the form of hNcenM i
The motivation for such a form is the relation between
the central galaxy luminosity and the host halo mass pre-
dicted by galaxy formation models Based on predictions
of SA and SPH galaxy formation models Zheng et al
2005 show that the distribution of the central galaxy
luminosity Lc at xed halo mass M can be described by
a log-normal distribution and here we write it as
P log LcM  
2log L
exp
log Lc  loghLcM i2
In halos of mass M  the mean occupation function of
the central galaxies above a luminosity threshold Lmin
is an integration of equation 4 over log Lc and the re-
sult turns out to have the same form as equation 2 but
with the argument of the erf function being log Lmin 
loghLcM i2log L
If the mass range of the cut-
o prole is not large so that we can approximate the
mean luminosity hLcM i of central galaxies in halos of
mass M as hLcM i  M p it is straightforward to see
the meaning of the parameters in equation 2  Mmin
is the mass of halos in which the mean luminosity of
central galaxies is the luminosity threshold Lmin and
the width of the cuto prole is related to the scatter
of the central galaxy luminosity in halos of mass M as
log M  2log Lp Therefore by studying the HODs
of galaxy samples with dierent luminosity thresholds
we would learn the distribution mean and scatter of
central galaxy luminosity as a function of halo mass from
the cuto prole and the mass scale of hNcenM i We
follow the above explanation when interpreting our mod-
eling results
According to predictions from N body SA and
SPH galaxy formation models Kravtsov et al 2004
Zheng et al 2005 the mean occupation function of
satellite galaxies hNsatM i approximately follows a
power law at the high halo mass end with the slope
close to unity At lower mass hNsatM i drops steeper
than the power-law extrapolation and can be parameter-
1 where M0 is the mass scale of
ized by M  M0M 
the drop M 
1 characterizes the amplitude and  is the
asymptotic slope at high halo mass Applying the same
cuto prole of the central galaxies we assume the fol-
lowing form for the mean occupation of satellite galaxies
for M  M0

For modeling the two-point correlation function of
galaxies we also need to know the second moment of
the occupation number in addition to the mean Central
galaxies simply follow the nearest-integer distribution
Berlind  Weinberg 2002 Zheng et al 2005 and for
satellite galaxies we assume a Poisson distribution that
is consistent with theoretical predictions Kravtsov et al
2004 Zheng et al 2005 The spatial distribution of
galaxies inside halos is assumed to be the same as the
dark matter that follows the NFW prole a reasonable
assumption on scales we model eg Nagai  Kravtsov
2005 Maccio et al 2006 Overall our basic HOD pa-
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
rameterization has a total of ve parameters  two for
hNcenM i Mmin and log M  and three for hNsatM i
M0 M 
1 and  With respect to the simple three-
parameter model used in Zehavi et al 2005 our ve-
parameter model essentially introduces one additional
parameter to hNcenM i and one to hNsatM i to char-
acterize the cuto proles at low halo mass
For theoretical calculations of galaxy two-point cor-
relation functions we adopt the method proposed in
Tinker et al 2005 which improves that presented in
Zheng 2004 by incorporating a more accurate treat-
ment of the halo exclusion eect The method is cal-
ibrated and tested using mock catalogs and can reach
an accuracy of 10 or better in calculating galaxy two-
point correlation functions More specically we adopt
the n
gmatched approximation see their Appendix B
for a more ecient calculation
4 HOD MODELING RESULTS FOR DEEP2 AND SDSS
GALAXIES
We perform HOD modeling of the projected two-point
correlation function wprp for each DEEP2 galaxy sam-
ple The jackknife covariance matrices estimated from
the DEEP2 data are noisy due to the size of the vol-
ume probed and we therefore use only the diagonal ele-
ments in measuring 2 In calculating 2 for each sam-
ple in addition to wprp we also include the galaxy
number density obtained by integrating the observed
luminosity function Willmer et al 2006 and assigning
a 10 fractional uncertainty to the result We ap-
ply a Markov Chain Monte Carlo MCMC see eg
Gilks Richardson  Spiegelhalter 1996 method to ex-
plore the parameter space For the purpose of com-
parison we also model the SDSS galaxy samples in
Zehavi et al 2005 using the same HOD parameteriza-
tion and MCMC method The full jackknife covariance
matrices are used for the SDSS samples We perform a
test with the Mr  205 SDSS sample by only includ-
ing the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix in the
t and nd that the best-t 2 is higher which reects
the fact that the likely positive covariance among val-
ues of the two-point correlation function in adjacent bins
is neglected However the marginalized distributions of
HOD parameters are found to be pretty similar to those
with the full covariance matrix The test indicates that
there are not likely to be large systematic uncertainties
in the inferred HOD parameters for the DEEP2 samples
for which we use only the diagonal elements of the co-
variance matrices in the ts
Best-t HOD parameters for DEEP2 and SDSS sam-
ples are listed in Table 1 We also list two derived param-
eters in the table M1 not M 
1 the mass scale of a halo
that can on average host one satellite galaxy above the
luminosity threshold and bg the large scale bias factor
of galaxies In this section we briey describe the mod-
eling results and ts to wprp focusing on the DEEP2
galaxies Detailed inspections of individual HOD param-
eters and comparisons between occupation properties of
DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies are presented in the next sec-
41 Results for DEEP2 Galaxies
The modeling results for the four DEEP2 luminosity
In each of
threshold samples are shown in Figure 1
the left panels lines from model predictions are plot-
ted together with the wprp data points All ts are
excellent With ve parameters one of which is largely
determined by the mean galaxy density once the other
four are specied this success may seem unsurprising
However it is worth noting that the combination of the
CDM halo distribution xed by our assumed cosmol-
ogy and an HOD model cannot t arbitrary functions
 this is a physically constrained model with vastly less
freedom than say a 4th-order polynomial Our HOD ts
self-consistently produce the two-point correlation func-
tion both on small scales and on large scales On small
scales the two-point correlation function reects how
galaxies are spatially distributed inside halos On large
scales eg  10h1Mpc the galaxy two-point corre-
lation function is simply the matter correlation function
multiplied by a constant ie the square of the scale-
independent galaxy bias factor Our HOD model nicely
reproduces the large-scale shape of wprp which indi-
cates that the matter power spectrum we use has the
correct shape on these scales
The central solid line corresponds to the best-t model
and is bounded by two solid lines which are the envelopes
of predictions from models with 2  1 As we do
not have the full error covariance matrix these should
only be interpreted as indicative of the associated 1-
uncertainty The best-t line is decomposed into contri-
butions from the one-halo term intra-halo galaxy pairs
dotted lines and two-halo term inter-halo galaxy pairs
dashed lines which dominate on small and large scales
respectively The transition from the one-halo term to
the two-halo term causes an inection in wprp lead-
ing to departures from a pure power law that are ob-
served for both low redshift galaxies eg Zehavi et al
2004 Hawkins et al 2003 and high-redshift galaxies
eg Ouchi et al 2005 Lee et al 2006
If the transi-
tion scale is dened as the scale where the two contribu-
tions to wprp are equal we nd that it increases from
04h1Mpc to 06h1Mpc as the luminosity threshold
of galaxies increases a manifestation that more luminous
galaxies reside in more massive halos
The mean occupation functions for the four DEEP2
samples are shown in the right panels of Figure 1 The
mean occupation function for all galaxies in the sample
is decomposed into that for central galaxies and that for
satellites For each mean occupation function we plot
the envelope from models with 2  1 It can be clearly
seen that the mean occupation function shifts to higher
halo mass as the luminosity of galaxies increases In gen-
eral a low-mass cuto in the satellite mean occupation
function which is usually neglected in the simple three-
parameter model is required by the DEEP2 wprp data
for a good model t The best-t models for the two
brighter samples have a shallow cuto prole in hNceni
For the two fainter samples the inferred cuto prole
in hNceni can be either sharp or shallow which leads to
the kink seen in the envelope of hNceni for models with
2  1 The general trend that the central galaxy
cuto prole is better constrained for brighter galaxies

ker private communication
We note that the constraints on the HOD models can
be further strengthened by enforcing the condition that
at any halo mass the mean occupation number for cen-
tral or satellite galaxies in a sample with lower luminos-
ity threshold is always higher than that for galaxies in a
sample with higher luminosity threshold A full imple-
mentation of this would require modeling the data from
all galaxy samples simultaneously and there would be
strong correlations among mean occupation functions of
dierent samples Here we choose to model each sample
individually To roughly account for the above condi-
tion we drop some models that are in apparent conict
Specically the mean occupation functions of satellites
for the MB190 sample from a small fraction of mod-
els have a cuto at much higher mass than those for the
MB195 sample which is not realistic We therefore
only keep models for the MB190 sample with a satel-
lite cuto mass of M01012h1M for the following dis-
cussions We note that the above consistency condition
is automatically satised by adopting the CLF method
with the HOD of each sample obtained by integrating the
CLF over halo mass although to reach a similar level of
exibility in the HOD we use here more parameters need
to be introduced in the CLF

ized distribution ie 1 range Although the value
for the most luminous sample is slightly larger all val-
ues are close to unity which agrees with predictions
of galaxy formation models eg Kravtsov et al 2004
Zheng et al 2005
We note that the best-t HOD model for the bright-
est DEEP2 sample MB  205 has a larger 2 than
those of the other samples Much of the dierence be-
tween the model and the data happens on small scales
rp  05h1Mpc On these scales the raw measure-
ments of wprp are aected by the undersampling of
galaxies caused by the slitmask target selection algo-
rithm and they are corrected by using the mock galaxy
catalogs of Yan et al 2004 Coil et al 2006a In gen-
eral the correction increases the amplitude and the slope
of wprp on small scales by a small amount As a test of
the robustness of our HOD results to this correction we
perform an MCMC run with the uncorrected wprp data
for this sample and nd 2dof  075 The inferred
HOD therefore seems to be robust against such a cor-
rection  there is almost no change except for a slight
decrease in the number of satellite galaxies in low-mass
halos to account for the slightly reduced amplitude and
slope of the uncorrected wprp The slitmask correction
could in principle be improved by using catalogs gener-
ated according to the best-t HOD model and iterating
the correction and model tting a couple of times How-
ever given the robustness of the best-t HOD under the
adopted parameterization we do not intend to perform
such iterations in this paper
We also tried to t the data with a more exible HOD
parameterization which uses a spline line for the satel-
lite mean occupation function similar to what is used in
Fig19c of Zehavi et al 2005 We found that the HOD
is adjusted to t almost every feature in wprp and the
modeling may result in solutions that are not seen in
galaxy formation models For instance for the brightest
MB  205 sample the best-t satellite mean occupa-
tion function has an inection and attens out toward
the low halo mass end which allows it to t the high
amplitude and steep slope of wprp on small scales that

are vulnerable to slitmask corrections Therefore we
conclude that this more exible HOD parameterization
might be over tting the data and that to robustly in-
terpret the present data does not require an HOD form
more exible than our ve-parameter model
42 Results for SDSS Galaxies
The modeling results for SDSS galaxies using the ve-
parameter model described in 32 are shown in Fig-
ure 2 To be concise only the results of the samples that
are most relevant to the evolution connection between
DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies see  6 are plotted in this
gure although we perform HOD modeling for all SDSS
samples with luminosity cuts ranging from Mr  180
to Mr  220 see Table 1
Unlike the DEEP2 samples the cuto proles of
hNcenM i for the SDSS samples are loosely constrained
This can be partly explained by noticing that in the mass
range of 10111012h1M both the halo mass function
and the halo bias factor at z1 are steeper than those at
z0 and therefore the galaxy number density and the
amplitude of the two-point correlation function at large
scales lead to a better constraint in the cuto prole for
DEEP2 galaxies We also note that complete freedom
in log M eq 2 leads to a strong correlation between
Mmin and log M in the sense that larger Mmin corre-
sponds to larger log M  which results in poor constraints
on Mmin We assign a prior log M  05 being conser-
vative according to theoretical predictions Zheng et al
2005 for SDSS galaxy samples with luminosity thresh-

r 2044
The transition scales from one-halo term to two-halo
term for SDSS samples are around 1h1Mpc larger than
those for DEEP2 galaxies The cause of such a shift
is that the one-halo term for SDSS galaxies appears to
be shallower than that for DEEP2 galaxies which again
reects the change in the slope of the halo mass func-
tion in the mass range probed by DEEP2 and SDSS
galaxies note that for the halo denition we adopt
at a given mass the comoving sizes of halos at the two
epochs are the same This also explains why the depar-
ture of the two-point correlation function from a power
law becomes more prominent at higher redshift eg

5 COMPARISONS OF THE HOD MODELING RESULTS
FOR DEEP2 AND SDSS GALAXIES
In this section on the basis of the MCMC results pre-
sented in the previous section we compare the HODs of
DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies in detail
51 The Central Galaxy Luminosity as a Function of
Halo Mass
As mentioned in  32 the low-mass cuto prole of
the mean occupation function of central galaxies encodes
information about the distribution of central galaxy lu-
minosities in halos with mass close to the cuto mass By
modeling the galaxy two-point correlation functions for
samples with dierent luminosity thresholds we can de-
rive the distribution of the central galaxy luminosity as a
function of halo mass If the central galaxy luminosity Lc
in halos of xed mass follows a log-normal distribution
as suggested by SA and SPH galaxy formation models
Zheng et al 2005 then the mass scale Mmin in equa-
tion 2 is the mass of halos for which the mean central

luminosity as a function of halo mass see text for details
galaxy luminosity hLci is simply the luminosity thresh-
old of the galaxy sample as shown in  32 The left
panel of Figure 3 shows the inferred hLciM relation for
DEEP2 galaxies and for SDSS galaxies In the plot ab-
solute magnitudes are converted to luminosity in units
of solar luminosity by using the Suns absolute magni-
tudes 476 in rband Blanton et al 2003b and 538 in
Bband5 Johnson AB magnitude
The hLciM relations look similar for the DEEP2 and
SDSS galaxies except for an oset At xed halo mass
there is an oset of 14 in hLci between the DEEP2
and SDSS relations However given that the two sam-
ples are selected in dierent rest-frame bands this oset
does not necessarily imply that z  1 DEEP2 galaxies
are more luminous than z  0 SDSS galaxies at a xed
halo mass Alternatively at xed hLci there is an oset
of  16 in halo mass between the DEEP2 and SDSS
samples Similarly the interpretation of such an oset
is not immediately clear In  6 we attempt to establish
a more meaningful evolutionary link between galaxies at
the two epochs
r  2044 L
Because of a large range in galaxy luminosity the
SDSS samples probe the hLciM relation over 2 orders
of magnitude in halo mass from 2  1011h1M to
3  1013h1M as shown in the left panel of Figure 3
We see that halos with higher mass host more luminous
central galaxies at both z  1 and z  0 The plot shows
that halos of Milky Way size 21012h1M currently
host central galaxies with mean luminosity about L
r  120  1010h2L Blanton et al
2003b Higher mass halos begin to host galaxy groups
and clusters so we expect that the hLciM relation
changes slope with halo mass
Indeed the mean lu-
minosity of central galaxies increases steeply with halo
mass at the low-mass end and increases more slowly at
the high-mass end with the slope changing continuously
from 25 to 03 over the mass range
The hLciM relation from the SDSS modeling results

whose slope becomes shallower toward higher halo mass
is in general agreement with results for local galaxies
derived by other methods Yang et al 2005 infer the
hLciM relation in bJ band through associating halos
with galaxy groups identied in the 2dFGRS and they
nd hLci  M 23 for halos of M  1013h1Mpc and
hLci  M 14 for more massive halos Using the X-
ray masses of clustersgroups and the K-band lumi-

lation for M  1013M which can be approximated
as hLci  M 075 Vale  Ostriker 2004 present an
empirical model for the relation between galaxy lumi-
nosity and halo mass by matching the galaxy luminos-
ity function and halosubhalo mass function see also
Vale  Ostriker 2006 and nd that the mass luminos-
ity relation can be well approximated by a double power
law Vale  Ostriker 2006 advocate a tting formula
of the following form

with Mc  37  109h1M a  2978 b  295 and
k  00255 With these parameter values L0 is the mean
galaxy luminosity in halos of mass 346  1011h1M
The relation is steep at low mass and becomes hLci 
M 028 at high mass We nd that this tting formula
provides a good description of our modeling results of the
SDSS galaxies if L0  28  109h2L see the dotted

a few times more massive than L halos at z  0 At
M  2  1012h1M the shape of the hLciM relation
at z  1 is consistent with that at z  0 At higher halo
masses hLci appears to increase with M slightly more
slowly at z  1 than at z  0 The dotted line passing
through the DEEP2 measurements in the left panel of
Figure 3 is from the tting formula in equation 6 with
L0 set to be 43  109h2L
In addition to the mean luminosity of central galax-
ies with our modeling results we can also study the
width log L of the distribution of central galaxy lumi-
nosity at a xed halo mass see eq 4 The information
is encoded in the width log M of the cuto prole of
hNcenM i and the local slope p of the hLciM line 
log L  plog M 2 see  32 The results of the width
of the central galaxy luminosity distribution are shown
in the right panel of Figure 3 where a spline line passing
through the hLciM points is used to infer the local slope
p for the SDSS and DEEP2 samples independently The
error bar on each point indicates the 1- scatter in log L
from its marginalized distribution at the halo mass In
general the scatter is not well-constrained by two-point
correlation functions for low-luminosity samples as the
halo mass function and halo bias factor are not steep at
the low-mass end Therefore we can remark only on gen-
eral trends in the scatter We nd that at a xed halo
mass the scatter log L in the central galaxy luminosity
for z  1 DEEP2 galaxies is about 1020 higher than
that for z  0 SDSS galaxies except for the brightest
DEEP2 sample For samples at both redshifts there is
a trend that log L decreases with increasing halo mass
although the signicance from the modeling results is
marginal In the mass range we can probe log L changes
from  03 to  01 for both SDSS and DEEP2 galaxies
The value of log L approaches a constant of  011012
at masses above 2  1012h1M for both samples
The decrease of log L with increasing halo mass ex-
cept for the last SDSS data point if true is consistent
with theoretical expectations eg Zheng et al 2005
Croton et al 2006 in the halo mass range probed here
The last SDSS data point seems to show an increase but
with large uncertainty Although theoretical models also
predict that log L should increase with halo mass again
at higher mass it is at a mass much higher than probed
here eg M  5  1013h1M We note as well
that the observed intrinsic scatter of the Tully-Fisher
Tully  Fisher 1977 relation eg Giovanelli et al
1997  020035 mag implies log L 008014 if one
assumes that the circular velocity is a one-to-one indica-
tor of halo mass There is also a trend in the observed
intrinsic scatter decreasing as the circular velocity in-
creases similar to what we see in our results We spec-
ulate that the reason for the relatively large scatter in
central galaxy luminosity for lower mass halos may be
that the distribution of major star formation epochs is
broad for these halos
52 Relation Between Halo Mass Scales of Central and
Satellite Galaxies
In  51 we determined the mass scales of central galax-
ies as a function of galaxy luminosity We now focus on
the halo occupation of satellite galaxies and the rela-
tion between the halo mass scales of central and satellite
galaxies
In our HOD parameterization the parameter Mmin
can be interpreted as the characteristic minimum mass
of the halo hosting a central galaxy above the luminos-
ity threshold hNceni  05 at Mmin see eq 2 For
satellite galaxies the characteristic halo mass scale M1
is dened as the mass of a halo that on average can
host one satellite galaxy above the luminosity threshold
hNsatM1i  1 note that M1 is dierent from M 
eq5 In Figure 4 we show Mmin and M1 as a function
of galaxy luminosity for DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies In
the left panel luminosity is relative to L at each red-
shift and in the right panel luminosity is in solar units
For central galaxies the data points are essentially those
in Figure 3 viewed at a dierent angle As mentioned
in  51 the DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies are selected in
dierent rest-frame bands such that inferring evolution
between the samples is complex Comparing galaxies rel-
ative to L at each redshift can roughly account for the
dierent selections and the general dimming of galaxies
since z  1 The plot shows that the host halos of z  1
L galaxies are more massive than those of z  0 L
galaxies a trend of downsizing in terms of the host halo
mass of typical galaxies with time since z  1
In Zehavi et al 2005 the HOD modeling for SDSS
galaxies reveals a relation M1  23Mmin Because of
the slightly dierent HOD parameterization Mmin and
M1 in our analysis do not correspond exactly to those
in Zehavi et al 2005 Our modeling results of the
SDSS galaxies as shown in Figure 4 can be expressed
as M1  18Mmin Zheng et al 2005 present M1Mmin
relations in SA and SPH galaxy formation models for
samples of galaxies above varying baryonic mass thresh-
olds and nd that the scaling factors are about 18 and
14 for the two models respectively Their denitions of
Mmin and M1 are more consistent with the ones used
here and this may be the reason that our results here
are in better agreement with the theoretical predictions
of Zheng et al 2005
The M1Mmin scaling relation for z  1 DEEP2 galax-
ies is similar to that for z  0 SDSS galaxies as shown
in Figure 4 The scaling factor is about 16 close to the
value for SDSS galaxies Dissipationless simulations in
Kravtsov et al 2004 show a weak trend of the scaling
factor decreasing towards high redshift which can be un-
derstood as the satellite galaxies not having enough time
to merge with the central galaxies at higher redshift
For both data sets the scaling factor of the M1Mmin
relation has a trend of becoming smaller at the high-
luminosity end High luminosity satellite galaxies reside
in massive halos At any given redshift massive halos
form late and the accreted satellite galaxies do not have
enough time to merge with the central galaxies This
eectively reduces the mass of the halos that on average
host one satellite galaxy Therefore the eect of merging
timescale may be the primary reason that the scaling
factor decreases for very luminous galaxies
From Figure 4 we can also see that at a xed halo
mass central galaxies are much more luminous than typ-
ical satellite galaxies for both DEEP2 and SDSS samples
with the dierence being larger toward lower halo mass
This is a manifestation of a CLF bump caused by the cen-
tral galaxy seen in galaxy formation models Zheng et al
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
Fig 4 Mass scales of halos hosting central galaxies and satellites as a function of galaxy luminosity Left Mass scales as a function
of LL Filled symbols connected by solid lines are the relation between the characteristic minimum halo mass Mmin and the luminosity
threshold and open symbols are that between M1 and the luminosity threshold where M1 is the mass of a halo that on average hosts one
satellite galaxy above the luminosity threshold Dotted lines are obtained by multiplying the solid lines by a factor of 18 SDSS and 16
DEEP2 respectively Right Same as the left panel but the luminosity is expressed in units of solar luminosity
Figure 5 shows the satellite fraction as a function of
the luminosity threshold for DEEP2 and SDSS galaxy
samples based on the MCMC runs where the luminos-
ity threshold is expressed in units of L SDSS galaxies
have a larger satellite fraction than DEEP2 galaxies For
example 20 of L  L SDSS galaxies are satellite
galaxies compared to 10 of L  L DEEP2 galax-
ies For both DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies the satellite
fraction tends to decrease as the luminosity threshold
increases For L  L the satellite fraction as a func-
tion of luminosity seems to drop more steeply This trend
with galaxy luminosity reveals that luminous galaxies are
much more likely to be central galaxies in lower mass ha-
los than satellite galaxies in higher mass halos
Conroy et al 2006 predict the evolution of the lumi-
nosity dependence of galaxy clustering for the redshift
range 0  z  5 by monotonically relating galaxy lumi-
nosities to the maximum circular velocity of halos and
subhalos in N -body simulations Their Table 2 lists
the relevant HOD parameters at each redshift for var-
ious luminosity threshold samples with dierent num-
ber densities Our inferred HODs at z  1 and z  0
are in good agreement with their non-parametric results
The dotted lines in Figure 5 are satellite fractions calcu-
lated from interpolating the parameters in Conroy et al
2006 which are consistent with our results in the rel-
evant luminosity range We note that satellite frac-
tions obtained here through HOD modeling of the two-
point correlation function can in principle be compared
to those inferred through relating galaxy groups iden-
tied in the surveys eg Gerke et al 2005 Coil et al
2006b for the DEEP2 survey and Berlind et al 2006
Weinmann et al 2006 for the SDSS survey to dark mat-
ter halos for a consistency test
On large scales galaxy pairs have contributions from
central galaxies paired with each other Being lower in
number satellite galaxies do not contribute as much to
the two-point galaxy correlation function on large scales
as on small scales However applications that relate the

range of the marginalized distribution from MCMC runs The dot-
ted lines are calculated from interpolating the HOD parameters in
Conroy et al 2006 which are inferred through relating halos and
subhalos in N -body simulations to galaxies
53 Satellite Fraction
A galaxy at a given luminosity can be either a central
galaxy in a relatively lower mass halo or a satellite galaxy
in a higher mass halo with the former being much more
probable Zheng et al 2005 Although at a xed lumi-
nosity satellite galaxies are not dominant in number they
play a signicant role in shaping the two-point correla-
tion function of galaxies on small scales where the one-
halo term dominates On these scales galaxy pairs are
composed of central-satellite and satellite-satellite pairs
Therefore the two-point correlation function can pro-
vide strong constraints on the overall fraction of satellite
galaxies
Zheng Coil  Zehavi
large-scale galaxy bias factor relative to dark matter
to the halo bias factor often neglect this small contri-
bution from satellite galaxies which can systematically
aect the results on the inferred mass scale and number
density of host halos In the Appendix we quantify the
systematic error resulting from the one galaxy per halo
assumption using a simple HOD model
6 EVOLUTIONARY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN DEEP2
GALAXIES AND SDSS GALAXIES
Thus far we have compared dierent aspects of the
halo occupations of DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies treating
the results as static observations of the galaxy pop-
ulation at two dierent redshifts We now attempt to
establish an evolutionary link between galaxies at the
two epochs to study the evolution of the statistically
same galaxies with time By same we mean a galaxy
and its most massive progenitor
HOD modeling converts observed galaxy clustering
measurements to a relation between galaxy properties
and their host dark matter halos The formation and evo-
lution of the halos themselves are dominated by gravity
which is well understood from theory and simulations
In principle we know how the halo population at an ear-
lier epoch evolves to that at a later epoch Given the
relationships between galaxies and halos at two dierent
epochs the galaxy populations at those epochs can then
be linked through the growth of their halos
In what follows we implement this idea to study the
evolution of central galaxies in the DEEP2 and SDSS
samples We rst establish a relationship between z  0
halo mass and progenitor halo mass at z  1 in  61
Using this relation and the HOD modeling results in
 62 we link the z  0 central galaxies and their progen-
itor central galaxies at z  1 in terms of luminosity to
measure the luminosity evolution of galaxies since z  1
The stellar mass of a galaxy is perhaps a more funda-
mental physical parameter than luminosity and is more
straightforward to interpret and compare to theoretical
models Therefore in  63 using the same halo mass re-
lationship we attempt to link central galaxies at the two
redshifts in terms of stellar mass to study the growth of
stellar mass as a function of host halo mass From this we
are able to draw tentative conclusions on galaxy evolu-
tion and star formation as a function of halo mass during
the past 7 billion years Finally in  64 using the stel-
lar mass derived in  63 we study how star formation
eciency depends on halo mass at the two redshifts
61 Typical Growth of Halos from z 1 to z 0
To use our HOD results presented here what we want
to know is the mass of the z  1 progenitor halo for each
of the z  0 host halos A dark matter halo merger tree
that traces the assembly history of halos serves this pur-
pose well We use the PINOCCHIO PINpointing Orbit-
Crossing Collapsed HIerarchical Objects code developed
by Monaco et al 2002a see also Monaco et al 2002b
Taoni et al 2002 to predict the assembly history of
dark matter halos PINOCCHIO is based on Lagrangian
perturbation theory and can generate synthetic catalogs
of halos that include mass position velocity merger his-
tory and angular momentum For the halo assembly
history predictions of PINOCCHIO are much more ac-
curate than those based on the extended Press-Schechter
formalism EPS Press  Schechter 1974 Bond et al
1991 Lacey  Cole 1993 Compared to N body sim-
ulations PINOCCHIO can predict the average mass as-
sembly history of halos to an accuracy of 10 or bet-
ter Li et al 2005 with several orders of magnitude less
computational time Furthermore unlike N body simu-
lations which need expensive postprocessing to extract
merger trees PINOCCHIO directly outputs the merger
history of each halo We perform four realizations of
PINOCCHIO in a 100Mpc3 box and three realizations
in a 50Mpc3 box to probe assembly histories of halos
with mass above and below 1012M respectively For
these runs the grid size is set to be 1283 The mass dis-
tribution of the z  1 progenitor halos of the z  0 halos
is obtained in a series of z  0 halo mass bins The code
does not include evolution of subhalos within parent ha-
los but it suces for our purpose here as we focus only
on central galaxies
The results of the typical halo growth from z  1 to
z  0 are presented in Figure 6c which shows the relation
between M  the mass of z  0 halos and Mpro the mass
of their z  1 progenitors The solid line represents the
mean mass of the progenitors and the two dotted lines
indicate the boundaries of the central 683 distribution
of the progenitor mass as a function of the z  0 halo
mass On average lower mass halos grow earlier in that
more of their nal mass is assembled by z  1 The
results show that a typical z  0 halo with M  3 
1011h1M M  1013h1M has about 70 50 of
its nal mass in place at z  1 We also use a merging
tree code based on the less accurate EPS formalism and
nd that it generally predicts late growth for halos and
leads to 15 lower masses of the z  1 progenitors in
the mass range we consider
62 Luminosity Evolution
The question we attempt to answer is for galaxies of
a given luminosity eg L at z  0 what luminosity
did their z  1 progenitor galaxies have We answer this
question using the HOD results above and the MproM
relation shown in Figure 6c
The MproM relation links halos at z 1 to those at
z 0 Together with the hLciM relations at these two
redshifts derived from DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies which
are plotted in Figure 6d and Figure 6a it enables a con-
nection between DEEP2 and SDSS central galaxies The
dashed lines across the four panels of Figure 6 illustrate
how such a connection is established Figure 6b shows the
resultant connection between the rband luminosity of
z  0 central galaxies and the Bband luminosity of their
z  1 progenitors For example the z  1 progenitors
r  2044 Lr  120  1010h2L
of the z  0 L M 
central galaxies on average have a Bband luminosity of
MB  200 LB  134  1010h2L less than L at
z  1
The above connection is between luminosities in two
dierent rest-frame bands at the two redshifts A more
interesting comparison may be between luminosities in
the same rest-frame band The best way to achieve such
a goal is to have galaxy samples observed in the same
rest-frame band which is not the case for samples an-
alyzed here and is hard to achieve in general at dier-
ent redshifts However we can obtain a rough connec-
tion by making a transformation between luminosities in
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
Fig 6 Connection between DEEP2 galaxies and SDSS galaxies Panels a and d show the mean luminosity of central galaxies as
a function of halo mass at z 0 SDSS and z 1 DEEP2 Panel c shows the relation between the mass M of the z 0 halos and the
mass Mpro of their z 1 progenitors The solid line is the mean relation and the dotted lines mark the central 683 of the distribution
Panels a c and d lead to a luminosity connection between DEEP2 galaxies and SDSS galaxies which is shown in panel b The four
dashed lines illustrate how this connection is established see text for details
the two bands We use the publicly-available kcorrect
code Blanton et al 2003a to estimate the median MB
values where B is a Bessell AB magnitude for SDSS
galaxies in a series of narrow Mr bins to facilitate com-
parison with MB samples in the DEEP2 data Using the
SDSS DR4 data and the same magnitude and redshift
thresholds as Zehavi et al 2005 we nd that the me-
dian MB value for galaxies at a xed Mr is MB  Mr 1
Our transformation implies that z  0 L
r galaxies have
a median LB  80  109h2L On average their
z  1 progenitors have MB  200 Fig 6b
LB  1341010h2L It is not entirely surprising that
their progenitor galaxies are more luminous as stars fade
as they age Using the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 model
we nd that the amount of passive luminosity evolution
at a xed time interval depends on the age of the stellar
population in the sense that younger populations fade
more This is related to the fact that luminous massive
stars have a shorter lifetime For a stellar population
with 021 solar metallicity which forms its stars in a
single instantaneous burst at redshift z 15 2 25 or
3 its rest-frame Bband luminosity would decrease by
about 18 14 12 or 10 mag respectively from z  1 to
z  0 Using these values as an estimate a z  1 progen-
itor central galaxy would have LB 2653109h2L
higher luminosity for stars forming at higher redshift
if they were passively evolving to z  0 This is fainter
than the z  0 central galaxies LB  80  109h2L
which implies that additional stars must have been added
to the system since z  1 through star formation andor
galaxy mergers
63 Stellar Mass Evolution
The connection between luminosities of local central
galaxies and their progenitors provides interesting in-
formation on the evolution of the stellar component of
Zheng Coil  Zehavi
Fig 7 Similar to Fig 6 but in terms of mean stellar mass
galaxies from z  1 to z  0 However a compar-
ison in terms of stellar mass would be more informa-
tive and straightforward to interpret as stellar mass is
a more fundamental physical parameter than luminos-
ity As with luminosities the ideal way to make this
comparison is to construct stellar-mass-selected galaxy
samples and to perform HOD modeling of the observed
clustering of these samples which we reserve for a future
study With the luminosity-selected samples used here
we use a simple estimation of stellar mass derived from
the galaxy luminosity and color While the correlation
between stellar mass and galaxy luminosity can have a
fair amount of scatter we attempt here to extract use-
ful information from the mean relation The following
analysis is presented as a proof of concept as to how one
could attempt to study evolution of galaxies in terms of
stellar mass and as a function of halo mass and it serves
only as a useful rst-order approximation for analyses
of stellar-mass-selected samples With these caveats in
mind we proceed as follows
For the DEEP2 galaxies stellar masses are derived by
Bundy et al 2006 for the subset for which Ks-band
imaging exists assuming a Chabrier stellar initial mass
function IMF Chabrier 2003 An empirically-derived
relation between rest-frame U BV colors redshift and
stellar mass is then used to estimate masses for the rest
of the DEEP2 sample C N A Willmer private commu-
nication For the SDSS samples we estimate the stellar
mass from the gr color and the rband luminosity using
the relation given by Bell et al 2003 The dominant
source of uncertainty in estimating stellar mass using the
above method is the IMF of stars Bell  de Jong 2001
The diet Salpeter IMF Bell et al 2003 is used for the
SDSS galaxies The eect of dierent IMFs is largely an
oset in the estimated stellar mass For example stel-
lar mass with the diet Salpeter IMF Chabrier IMF is
70 50 that with the Salpeter IMF We multiply the
DEEP2 stellar masses with the Chabrier IMF by a factor
of 14 to convert them to a diet Salpeter IMF so that
stellar masses from both surveys can be compared
The mean stellar mass of galaxies and the scatter are
calculated in a series of narrow luminosity bins We can
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
and the other is galaxy merging either merging of satel-
lites with central galaxies or merging of central galaxies
in dierent halos The star formation includes that which
occurs in the central galaxies and the star formation in
the satellite galaxies that eventually merge onto central
galaxies If we know the halo occupation as a function of
stellar mass at z  1 we can evolve the subhalo and halo
population at z  1 to z  0 using high-resolution N -
body simulations or an analytic code eg Zentner et al
2005 assuming no star formation Such a calculation
would give the amount of stars acquired through merg-
ers The dierence between the evolved stellar mass oc-
cupation and the true stellar mass occupation in halos of
a given mass inferred from z  0 data would tell us the
amount of stars formed during the period from z  1 to
z  0 While the samples we model are not well suited
for such a sophisticated analysis it is a goal we plan to
pursue in future work
The results presented in Figure 8 nevertheless allow us
to place interesting limits on the amount of stars added
to the present-day central galaxies by star formation and
merging in an average sense As seen from Figures 6 and
8 for z  0 halos with M  5  1011h1M their z  1
progenitors have assembled 70 of the z  0 mass
while the progenitor central galaxies have 20 of the
stellar mass in place For low-mass halos it is reasonable
to assume that the stellar mass in the progenitor halo
is dominated by those from central galaxies see eg
Zheng et al 2005 The progenitor halo therefore assem-
bles the remaining 30 mass by z  0 through smooth
mass accretion andor merging with one or more smaller
halos If the fraction of stellar mass inside this additional
mass is the same as in the progenitor halo ie smaller
halos are assumed to have the same star-formation e-
ciency as the progenitor of the 51011h1M halo then
at most 9 of the nal stellar mass can be gained by
this process That is the stellar mass in the progenitor
galaxy and that in the smaller halos that could merge
with it or the mass that is accreted can only amount
to 30 of the nal stellar mass in the z  0 central
galaxy Therefore for central galaxies in z  0 halos
with M  5  1011h1M 70 of the stars should
form between z  1 and z  0
Similar reasoning can be applied to higher mass ha-
los but one should keep in mind that the contribution
of stellar mass in satellites increases with halo mass
For z  0 halos with the highest mass we can probe
M  1013h1M which host galaxy groups satellite
galaxies contribute a substantial amount of the stellar
mass in the halo The z  1 progenitor of an aver-
age halo of this mass has assembled 54 of the total
mass and the progenitor central galaxy has 33 of its
stellar mass assembled Neglecting star formation the
progenitor central galaxy can merge with other central
galaxies with their total halo mass amounting to the re-
maining 46 of the z  0 halo mass and the total
contribution to the stellar mass in the nal z  0 central
galaxy from all the merged progenitor central galaxies
would be at most 60 Merging of satellites to the nal
central galaxy would make an additional contribution to
the stellar mass We crudely estimate this contribution
as follows In a halo satellite galaxies are usually fainter
than the central galaxy and in galaxy groups the bright-
est satellites are likely to be 16 mag 25 fainter
Fig 8 Mean stellar mass in z  0 central galaxies and that in
their z  1 progenitors top and their ratio bottom as a function
of the z  0 host halo mass
then convert the relation between central galaxy luminos-
ity and halo mass to that between stellar mass of central
galaxies and halo mass With the present-day central
galaxies and their progenitors at z  1 linked through
the MproM relation we recast Figures 6 in terms of
stellar mass which is shown in Figure 7 Here Figure 7b
shows the relation between the stellar mass of z  0 cen-
tral galaxies and that of the progenitors at z  1
Figure 8 the arithmetic mean stellar masses in central
galaxies at z  0 and those of their z  1 progenitors
as a function of the present-day halo mass are plotted
which allows an estimate of the average growth of central
galaxy stellar mass from z  1 to z  0 as a function of
halo mass Limited by the luminosity range of the data
the halo mass range that can be probed is slightly greater
than 1 order of magnitude The bottom panel of Figure 8
shows the ratio of the mean stellar masses in the z  1
progenitors and the z  0 central galaxies as a function
of the present-day halo mass which is expected to be in-
sensitive to the choice of the IMF At 5 1011h1M on
average a central galaxy had 20 of its present stellar
mass in place at z  1 The ratio gradually increases to
33 around 2  1012h1M and is roughly constant
up to the highest halo mass we can probe For galaxies
that reside in 2 1012h1M halos ie z  0 L
r galax-
ies the increase in stellar mass from z  1 appears to
be consistent with the luminosity comparison presented
in  62 if most stars in their z  1 progenitors do not
form at a very high redshift and the luminosity is roughly
proportional to stellar mass As shown in Figure 7c at
z  1 progenitor halos have already reached more than
50 of their total present-day mass Therefore in the
mass range probed here halos have most of their mass
assembled by z  1 but have most of their central galaxy
stars assembledformed more recently The mass scale of
121012h1M for present-day halos appears to be a
transition scale below which a relatively larger fraction
of stars have been added to the central galaxies during
the period from z  1 to z  0
In general there are two processes that can add stellar
components to central galaxies One is star formation
Zheng Coil  Zehavi
the stars in the present universe formed between z  1
and z  0 Based on stellar mass estimates from the
COMBO-17 survey Borch et al 2006 nd that the to-
tal stellar mass density of the universe has roughly dou-
bled since z  1 These numbers are well bracketed by
our values
The mass dependence of star formation that we nd
here can also be compared with other results We nd
that the stellar mass growth rate of central galaxies de-
pends on the host halo mass
Since halo mass and
central galaxy stellar mass are closely related this im-
plies that the growth rate depends on stellar mass itself
Jimenez et al 2005 use spectroscopic modeling to infer
the star formation histories of individual SDSS galaxies
and derive the mean star formation history as a func-
tion of galaxy stellar mass By integrating the fraction
of stellar mass in the last 68 billion years as a function
of stellar mass sum of the dotted and all the solid lines
in the top panel of their Fig4 we nd that for z  0
galaxies with stellar mass  2  1010M 70 of their
stars formed between z  08 and z  0 This fraction
drops to 40 for galaxies with a z  0 stellar mass
of  2  1011M Using the star formation histories of
SDSS galaxies estimated by Panter et al 2006 which
improves on the modeling in Jimenez et al 2005 the
above numbers become 60 and 25 Our estimates
show reasonable qualitative agreement with these results
It is worth noting that our method diers signicantly
from that of Panter et al 2006 who use stellar popu-
lation modeling of z  0 SDSS galaxies with no reference
to z  1 galaxies and do not use the clustering of either
population Our present analysis uses the population
synthesis model only to obtain stellar mass-to-light ra-
tios not evolutionary ages and our conclusions about
stellar mass growth result from the HOD modeling of
clustering at the two dierent redshifts The agreement
between the results from the two methods is therefore
impressive
Our results can also be compared with studies of
the evolution of star formation rates SFRs as a func-
tion of stellar mass Analyzing the AEGIS All Wave-
length Extended Groth Strip International Survey data
out to z  1 Noeske et al 2007a nd that star-
forming galaxies form a distinct sequence with a power-
law dependence of the SFR on the stellar mass see
also Noeske et al 2007b Converted to the diet
Salpeter IMF their result can be written as SF R 
36M yr1  Mstar1010M067 for Mstar in the range
of 14141010M and 02  z  07
If we parame-
terize the total stellar mass growth rate from both star
formation and mergers as a power-law
ie with a time-dependent normalization and time-
independent power-law index we can then solve for the
mean relation averaged over 0  z  1 utilizing the
stellar mass connection between these two epochs ie
Fig 7b For z  0 central galaxies with stellar mass
in the range of 0751010M we nd that the mean
growth rate of their stellar mass during the past 7Gyr
is Mstar  29M yr1Mstar1010M067 Compared
with the SFR in the star formation phase mentioned
above it is interesting to notice that the general growth
has the same dependence on the stellar mass but with
only a 20 lower normalization which suggests that

details of the estimation based on the HOD modeling of galaxy
clustering for the DEEP2 and SDSS galaxy samples The top solid
line would move up to be the dotted line after an upward correction
of 25 for the DEEP2 stellar mass estimation see text
than the central galaxies ie the luminosity gap see
Milosavljevic et al 2006 and references therein This
means that even if all the brightest satellites in halos
that are assembled into a z  0 1013h1M halo are
able to merge onto the nal central galaxy their contri-
bution to the stellar mass is only about 25 of that from
merging of central galaxies Thus the total stellar mass
from merging of central galaxies and satellites may likely
account for  60  60  25  75 of that in the
nal central galaxies The remaining 25 would then
be the result of star formation between z  1 and z  0
Using this same line of reasoning we illustrate in Fig-
ure 9 the dierent contributions to the z  0 central
galaxy stellar mass in the halo mass range we are able
to probe In this plot a linear interpolation in logarith-
mic halo mass based on the above limits for the low-
and high-mass ends is assumed to estimate the contri-
bution from satellite mergers Based on these crude es-
timations we nd an interesting result on average a
large fraction of stars in z  0 central galaxies resid-
ing in low-mass halos formed since z  1 eg 70
for 5  1011h1M halos while only a small fraction
of stars formed for central galaxies in high-mass halos
eg 25 for  1013h1M halos over the same pe-
riod This trend seems to be a manifestation of the
so-called downsizing  a pattern in which the sites of
active star formation shift from high-mass galaxies at
early times to lower-mass systems at later epochs eg
Cowie et al 1996 Juneau et al 2005 If the trend con-
tinues to higher halo mass beyond the luminosity range
we probe in this paper there may be no substantial star
formation occurring between z  1 and z  0 in very
massive halos
Are these estimates reasonable We can compare them
to values obtained from the global cosmic star formation
history eg Madau et al 1996 probed through dier-
ent techniques Using a recent compilation of data in
Fardal et al 2006 we estimate that about 40 of all
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
for these galaxies star formation is the dominant mode
of stellar mass growth and the star formation phase on
average may occupy a substantial fraction of the 7 Gyr
interval Modeling galaxy clustering data in more red-
shift slices between z  1 and z  0 would lead to a
better understanding of the implication of the general
growth rate
The numbers derived here should be taken as a rst-
order estimate as we have performed an approximate
calculation as a proof of concept There are two limit-
ing factors in the current data As mentioned earlier
the samples used here are dened using galaxy luminos-
ity and modeling stellar mass-selected samples would be
more appropriate for measuring the evolution of the stel-
lar mass growth rate as a function of halo mass The
other complication is the dierent rest-frame color se-
lections of the galaxies in particular the eect that the
DEEP2 samples used are not entirely volume limited for
red galaxies see  21 This could lead to an underes-
timate of the mean stellar mass as red galaxies have a
higher stellar mass than blue galaxies at a given lumi-
nosity Therefore we may be overestimating the stellar
mass evolution from z  1 to z  0 With smaller
volume-limited DEEP2 samples at a slightly lower red-
shift we estimate that the fraction of galaxies missing
in each DEEP2 sample is 10 and we also nd that
the mean stellar mass is likely to be underestimated by
2030 This means that 25 more of the stellar
mass could have been in place in the z  1 progeni-
tors than the numbers we quote here which would move
the line in the bottom panel of Figure 8 and the low-
est line in Fig 9 up by 25 Consequently the top
solid line in Figure 9 would shift upward to the place
of the dotted line The star formation contribution to
the stellar mass growth at the lower higher halo mass
end we probe would change from 70 25 to 65
5 However despite these uncertainties the general
trend of the contribution to the stellar mass growth as a
function of host halo mass remains the same Therefore
the halo mass-dependent evolution trend inferred from
the data is a robust result
64 Evolution of the Star Formation Eciency
With the relation between stellar mass and halo mass
at two epochs in hand we now present the evolution of
the star formation eciency and discuss the implications
Assuming that the baryon fraction in halos equals the
mean baryonic fraction fb in the universe for which we
adopt the value 157 see  31 then stellar mass
can be used to study the star formation eciency as
a function of halo mass at z  0 and z  1 Speci-
cally we associate a halo of mass M with a baryon mass
Mb  fbM and dene MstarMb as the star-formation
eciency where Mstar is the stellar mass of the central
galaxy in the halo This star formation eciency is in
essence the value integrated from the redshift of forma-
tion to the epoch in consideration z  1 for DEEP2
galaxies and z  0 for SDSS galaxies and reects the
fraction of baryons associated with halos that have been
converted to stars in the central galaxies by the given
In practice the baryon fraction in a halo may
not equal the global fraction due to various physical pro-
cesses For example in a low-mass halo there may be a
smaller fraction of baryons accreted because of the shal-
Fig 10 Mean fraction of baryons in host halos that are
converted into stars in central galaxies for z  0 SDSS and z  1
DEEP2 galaxies
low potential well Therefore more accurately the halo
star formation eciency dened here is the true star for-
mation eciency times the baryon accretion eciency of
the halo Nevertheless it is still an instructive quantity
that can be interpreted as an apparent star formation
eciency We note that by denition this eciency does
not include stars in satellite galaxies whose contribu-
tion increases with halo mass about a few percent at
5  1011h1M and 40 at 1013h1M according to
the estimates in  63
Figure 10 shows this star formation eciency reect-
ing the fraction of baryons that are converted into stars
at the two epochs Both lines are calculated from the ra-
tio of the arithmetic mean stellar mass of central galax-
ies in halos of a given mass to the average baryon mass
associated with these halos At z  0 there is a char-
acteristic mass scale of halos  6  1011h1M where
the average conversion eciency from baryons to stars
in central galaxies reaches a maximal value Even at this
peak only 27 of the baryons in the halo are converted
into stars of the central galaxy The star formation ef-
ciency drops steeply at lower halo masses and declines
more slowly at higher halo masses
At z  1 our inferred average conversion eciency
has a similar behavior to that at z  0 but the overall
conversion eciency decreases and the peak is reached at
a larger halo mass 1012h1M with a value of 12
While the absolute value of the eciency depends on
the IMF the trend as a function of mass and thus the
characteristic halo mass should not
Shankar et al 2006 infer the star formation eciency
at z  0 by matching the observed galaxy stellar mass
function with the theoretical halo mass function Their
result see the dashed line in their Fig5 is in a good
agreement with ours on the trend of the eciency with
halo mass our values are slightly lower than theirs but
are well within the error bars Mandelbaum et al 2006
perform HOD modeling of galaxy-galaxy lensing for stel-
lar mass-selected SDSS galaxy samples The stellar mass
in their study assumes the Kroupa 2001 IMF which is
about 30 lower than the diet Salpeter IMF we adopt
Zheng Coil  Zehavi
here With the IMF dierence corrected our estimate
of the dependence of the z  0 star formation e-
ciency on halo mass agrees well with their results see
their Table 3 After correcting for dierences in the
adopted IMF and halo denitions in the relevant halo
mass range our results at z  0 and z  1 also agree with
those reported by Heymans et al 2006 based on a weak
gravitational lensing study of the Hubble Space Telescope
GEMS Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and SED
survey It is worth emphasizing that our results follow
from the mass distribution of CDM halos and the galaxy
assignment required to reproduce the observed cluster-
ing while the galaxy lensing results are from direct mea-
surements of the dark matter halos through their weak-
lensing eects The agreement between our results and
the lensing results is therefore again impressive
What determines the halo mass scale where the aver-
age conversion eciency reaches a maximum It could
be star formation feedback or preheating Mo et al
2005 argue that present day halos less massive than
1012h1M were embedded in pancakes of M  5 
1012h1M at z  2 whose formation heats and com-
presses the gas leading to a cooling time longer than the
age of the universe at z  2 Therefore in halos below
1012h1M there is not much cold gas available for star
formation which leads to the drop in the conversion ef-
ciency Our z  0 mass scale is roughly consistent with
their prediction On the other hand our results indi-
cate that this halo mass scale shifts to a higher mass at
z  1 If true preheating alone may not be sucient to
explain this mass scale The intensity of star formation
and the subsequent feedback as a function of halo mass
and redshift may also be an important factor The shift
of the peak of star formation eciency from high-mass
halos to low-mass halos with time can be regarded as
another manifestation of the downsizing pattern seen in
star-forming galaxies For both DEEP2 and SDSS galax-
ies the drop of conversion eciency above the character-
istic halo mass could be in part due to the fact that we
only consider stars in central galaxies and in high-mass
halos the stellar mass contributions from satellite galax-
ies can be substantial In addition in high-mass halos
gas accretion becomes less ecient because of the high
virial temperature We note again that the stellar mass
results presented here are shown mainly as a proof of
concept and any conclusions based on these should be
regarded as tentative
7 SUMMARY AND FUTURE PROSPECTS
We perform HOD modeling of the projected galaxy
two-point correlation functions wprp for luminosity
threshold samples of DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies at z  1
and z  0 respectively The HOD modeling which con-
verts galaxy pair statistics to relations between galaxy
properties and dark matter halos reproduces well the
galaxy correlation functions at these two redshifts in-
cluding the rise on small scales seen at z  1
We infer the relationship between central galaxy lu-
minosity and halo mass at z  0 and z  1 We nd
that at both redshifts the mean central galaxy luminosity
hLci increases with halo mass In low-mass halos below
 1012h1M hLci increases more rapidly with halo
mass and the scatter in the central galaxy luminosity
in halos of xed mass appears larger possibly reecting
the broad distribution of major star formation epochs in
these halos We nd evolution in the HOD in that galax-
ies at a given halo mass are 14 times more luminous
at z  1 and for a given luminosity the halo mass is 16
times greater at z  0 with the caution that luminosities
of DEEP2 and SDSS are in dierent rest-frame bands
In addition central L galaxies are found to be in halos
a few times more massive at z  1 than at z  0
For both DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies there exists a
scaling relation between Mmin the characteristic mini-
mum mass of the halo that can host a central galaxy
above a given luminosity threshold and M1 the mass
scale of a halo that on average is able to host one satel-
lite galaxy above the same luminosity threshold There
is little dierence between the scaling relation at z  1
M1  16Mmin and that at z  0 M1  18Mmin
The fraction of galaxies that are satellites decreases with
increasing galaxy luminosity at both redshifts At a
xed luminosity threshold in units of L SDSS galax-
ies have a larger satellite fraction than DEEP2 galaxies
eg 20 versus 10 for L  L galaxies
The ultimate goal in modeling galaxy clustering at dif-
ferent redshifts is to learn about galaxy formation and
evolution These HOD modeling results provide us with
relationships between galaxies and dark matter halos at
z  1 and z  0 spanning half the history of the uni-
verse We use the typical growth of dark matter halos as
determined from simulations to establish an evolutionary
link between DEEP2 and SDSS galaxies and extract in-
formation about galaxy evolution over the last 7 billion
years We establish such a connection on average by
linking z  0 central galaxies to z  1 central galaxies
residing in the progenitor halos of the z  0 halos We
relate the luminosities of z  0 central galaxies to those
of their z  1 progenitors however the interpretation
is complicated somewhat by the dierent rest-frame se-
lection bands of SDSS and DEEP2 galaxies As a proof
of concept we use stellar masses determined by galaxy
color and luminosity to roughly estimate the evolution of
the dependence of stellar mass on host halo dark matter
mass At z  1 the mean fraction of baryons that have
been converted into stars is below 15 peaking at a
halo mass of 1012h1M At z  0 this fraction is be-
low 30 and the peak of the star formation eciency
is at a lower halo mass of  6  1011h1M We nd
that on average the majority of stars in z  0 central
galaxies in low-mass halos a few 1011h1M formed
between z  1 and z  0 while only a small fraction
of stars formed in central galaxies of halos as massive as
 1013h1M This reects the downsizing pattern seen
for star-forming galaxies as a function of stellar mass
shown now as a function of their host halo mass
The stellar mass results presented here are prelimi-
nary as the galaxy samples we model are dened by
luminosity not stellar mass In addition the SDSS and
DEEP2 surveys have dierent rest-frame selection func-
tions which complicates comparing the results at the
two redshifts Ideally we would like to have stellar mass-
selected galaxy samples at dierent redshifts from sur-
veys that have the same rest-frame selection functions
While our results apparently agree with other studies in
many aspects we regard our conclusions on the details of
the stellar mass evolution as tentative Nevertheless the
halo mass-dependent evolution trend we infer appears to
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
be robust and the exercise serves as a starting point and
guide for future work
HOD modeling of galaxy clustering for stellar mass-
selected samples at dierent redshifts would be a great
tool for gaining insight on galaxy formation and evolu-
tion and we plan to pursue this in future work Un-
like the simple estimates presented in this paper which
are based on a mean relationship between the nal halo
mass and progenitor halo mass a comprehensive pro-
gram would be more sophisticated Halos at high red-
shift populated with galaxies as a function of stellar
mass in accordance with the HOD results would serve
as initial conditions Then assuming no star formation
these halos would be evolved forward in time to lower
redshift following the merging histories and satellite dy-
namics determined from simulations or analytic models
This method is similar to the semi-analytic galaxy forma-
tion model in merging of halos and dynamically evolving
satellites but here the initial conditions are set by the
HOD modeling results This method diers from semi-
analytic models in that only dark matter evolution and
dynamics not baryon physics are involved in the cal-
culation The dierence between the evolved HOD and
the HOD inferred from galaxy clustering at low redshift
would then provide a wealth of information on star for-
mation as a function of halo mass For example the
contributions to stellar mass in central galaxies can be
separated  what fractions are from star formation from
central galaxies in other halos that merge with them and
from minor mergers with satellite galaxies We would
also infer the average star formation history in satellite
galaxies If galaxy clustering is modeled at a series of red-
shifts then the average continuous star formation history
and the average stellar mass growth history from other
modes ie major and minor mergers as a function of
halo mass can be determined Such empirically-derived
results would shed light on the physics of galaxy for-
mation and comparisons with predictions of galaxy for-
mation models would provide stringent tests for galaxy
formation theory An example of the eort starting along
some of these lines is White et al 2007 which uses
N -body simulations in combination with HOD modeling
of clustering to put constraints on merging of luminous
galaxies from z  09 to z  05
Additionally the envisioned program may also help
test the role of environment on galaxy formation and
evolution One of the main assumptions in the current
HOD framework is that the galaxy content in halos de-
pends only on the halo mass and is statistically indepen-
dent of the halos larger scale environment Gao et al
2005 nd in simulations a signature of age-dependent
halo clustering the so-called halo assembly bias see also

In general the environmental ef-
fect on halo clustering is essentially negligible for halos
above the nonlinear mass scale and becomes stronger for
lower mass halos With the method outlined above we
may be able to test the eect of large-scale environment
on galaxy evolution It is likely that the environment-
dependent halo clustering does not play a signicant role
in interpreting the observed galaxy clustering at high red-
shift due to the fast drop of the nonlinear mass eg from
z  1 to z  0 the nonlinear mass increases by a factor
of 25 while halos only grow by a factor of about 2 in a
large range of mass When we passively evolve a high-
redshift HOD which is insensitive to the environment to
lower redshift the environmental eect during the evo-
lution can be fully taken into account Comparing then
the evolved HOD which accounts for the environmen-
tal eect with the HOD inferred from the low redshift
data which ignores the environmental eect may pro-
vide insight on how environment shapes the HOD and
determines properties of galaxies in low-mass halos in-
creasing the constraining power of galaxy clustering on
galaxy formation processes

BIAS RELATED TO THE ASSUMPTION OF ONE GALAXY PER HALO
APPENDIX
Given a measured two-point correlation function for a galaxy population HOD modeling is the ideal path to infer
information about the host halos However this involves non-trivial modeling eorts and therefore approximations
are often used in the literature One commonly-used method assumes that there is one galaxy per halo and connects
galaxies to halos through the large-scale bias factor This assumes that all galaxies in the sample are central galaxies
while in reality a small fraction are satellite galaxies Using a simple HOD model we quantify the resulting systematic
bias in the inferred halo mass and the duty cycle of galaxies from this assumption
We consider galaxy samples dened by a lower threshold in luminosity or stellar mass The usual procedure associated
with the one galaxy per halo assumption is as follows The large-scale bias factor of galaxies is obtained from the
ratio of the measured galaxy two-point correlation function and the theoretical matter two-point correlation function
under the assumed cosmology This large-scale bias factor is the same as that of halos above a mass threshold Since
for an assumed cosmology the latter is a known function of mass threshold eg Mo  White 1996 Sheth et al 2001
Tinker et al 2005 the halo mass threshold Mmin can be determined The number density of halos above the mass
threshold Mmin can be inferred from the halo mass function eg Sheth  Tormen 1999 Jenkins et al 2001 The
Galaxy Evolution from HOD Modeling of DEEP2 and SDSS Galaxy Clustering
ratio of the observed galaxy number density to the inferred halo number density is used to determine the duty cycle
of galaxies More exactly the one galaxy per halo assumption should be called f galaxy per halo where f is a
positive constant smaller than unity representing the duty cycle
If satellite galaxies are taken into account using the same galaxy bias factor measured from the data a dierent
Mmin would be inferred To see how large the dierence is we assume a simple mean occupation function to represent
the truth this model is the sum of a step function for central galaxies and a power law for satellite galaxies
hN M i  1  MM1 for M  Mmin Following galaxy formation model predictions eg Kravtsov et al 2004
Zheng et al 2005 and HOD modeling results eg this paper Zehavi et al 2005 we use M1  20Mmin The above
hNi can have an overall normalization factor smaller than unity duty cycle factor and none of our results below
change
The bias factor b for a given galaxy sample in which all galaxies reside in halos of mass M  Mmin can be calculated
b Mmin  Z 
dM hN M ibhM cid30Z 
dM hN M i
where dndM is the halo mass function and bhM  is the bias factor of halos of mass M following Sheth  Tormen
1999 Solid lines in the top left panel of Figure 11 show the relation between Mmin and b Mmin at dierent
redshifts Assuming one galaxy per halo the bias is calculated by replacing hN M i with unity in equation A1
Dotted lines in the top left panel of Figure 11 show this relation At a given bias factor measured from the galaxy
two-point correlation function the value of Mmin with the assumption of no satellite galaxies dotted lines is always
higher than the true value solid lines because massive halos with high halo bias are weighted more as the number
of satellites increases with halo mass The bottom left panel of Figure 11 shows the ratio of the Mmin from the one
galaxy per halo method to the true value at each redshift as a function of the galaxy bias When the bias is high the
corresponding halos are in the exponential tail of the mass function and the weight from the satellite galaxies residing
in massive halos is less signicant therefore the value of Mmin inferred from the approximate method approaches its
true value However the dierence increases for lower galaxy biases corresponding to the shallower part of the halo
mass function and at higher redshift For instance at z  0 for a galaxy sample with b  12 the estimated Mmin
can be a factor of 2 higher than the true value
The dierence in the inferred values of Mmin leads to a dierence in the inferred number densities of halos above
Mmin The halo number density nh Mmin is calculated as
nh Mmin Z 
The right panels of Figure 11 compare the inferred from f galaxy per halo and the true number densities of halos
as a function of galaxy bias For a given galaxy bias the halo number density derived from the approximate Mmin is
always lower than the true value because without satellites in massive halos a larger value of Mmin is needed to reach
the given bias factor As with Mmin the estimated halo number density approaches the true value for highly biased
galaxy samples while for low bias factors the dierence can again be substantial For example at z  0 the number
density of host halos for galaxies with b  12 is underestimated by a factor of 2 As a consequence the duty cycle
the fraction of halos hosting galaxies of that type is overestimated by using the underestimated halo number density
For galaxy samples dened by a lower threshold eg in luminosity Figure 11 can be used to better estimate the
minimum host halo mass and number density from the measured galaxy bias value instead of assuming one galaxy
per halo
