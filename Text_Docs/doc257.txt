Asymptotic Giant Branch AGB stars are important players in
Abstract
the chemical evolution modelling of galaxies because they are major producers
of several chemical elements and excellent tracers of the structure and of the star
formation activity of their parent galaxies A few examples on the importance of
AGB stars are presented in this review together with a number of open problems
aecting chemical evolution model predictions related to the element enrichment
by AGB stars the evolution of 4He and Na in globular clusters the evolution
of 3He and the carbon isotopes in the Galactic disk and the evolution of N and
O in dierent types of galaxies The need of homogeneous and complete sets of
yields is emphasized
Introduction
There are several reasons why galaxies and galaxy modellers care about Asymp-
totic Giant Branch stars AGB stars trace the halo stellar distribution see
Demers in this volume thus indicating what is the size and the dynamics of
the system they trace intermediate-age stars see Grebel this volume thus
showing if and how much star formation SF activity has occurred in the re-
gion 05 - 1 Gyr ago they are the major site of production of several chemical
elements see Busso and Lattanzio in this volume and fundamental contributors
to the stellar nucleosynthesis yields which in turn are the main ingredients of
chemical evolution models
This review is focussed on the third point which is the most important one
for chemo-dynamical models of galaxy evolution Let me however mention how
important it is to trace intermediate age and old populations IZw18 is the most
metal poor star-forming galaxy ever discovered Being very blue and full of gas
it was often considered a local counterpart of primeval galaxies and a really young
system with SF activity begun only a few Myr ago However when HST optical
photometry became available AGB stars were found Aloisi Tosi  Greggio
1999 and then conrmed with near-infrared HST photometry Ostlin 2000
The presence of AGB stars undisputably demonstrated that IZw18 is not as
young as originally thought and must have started forming stars at least 05 - 1
Gyr ago
Here I will describe the eects of AGB stars as interstellar medium ISM
polluters with reference to the evolution of a few interesting elements 3He 4He
12C 13C N and Na The galaxy evolution models described here are all standard
in the sense that they do not explicitely treat dynamical aspects It is however
becoming increasingly clear that to understand galaxy evolution dynamical and
hydrodynamical eects cannot be left aside
2 AGB stars as ISM polluters 4He Na and the evolution of glob-
ular clusters
In recent years there has been an increasing interest on the possibility of a
second generation of stars in some globular clusters Some of the observed prop-
erties of globular clusters are indeed considered evidence of a second SF event
For instance the anticorrelation between the sodium and oxygen abundances
measured in stars of several clusters eg Carretta Bragaglia  Cacciari 2004
and references therein has been interpreted as the consequence of the cluster
self-enrichment if the gas replenishment from the retention of stellar ejecta is
sucient to allow for further SF In this scenario the stars born during the sec-
ond SF episode form from mostly if not entirely recycled gas and their initial
chemical compositions reect the yields of the stars mostly contributing to the
cluster self-enrichment Gratton et al 2001 and DAntona et al 2002 sug-
gested that high Na enrichment and signicant O depletion are most naturally
explained if the major culprits of the cluster self-pollution are relatively mas-
sive AGB stars The stars with more O and less Na would be those formed in
the rst generation while the stars with less O and more Na would be those
formed in the second generation DAntona et al 2002 further suggested that
the second generation would be signicantly enriched also in helium again as
a consequence of the predominance of AGB star ejecta in the gas available for
SF and that this could explain the Horizontal Branch morphology of clusters
with extreme blue tails Other authors however have argued that the winds
of massive stars have more chances than AGB stars to adequately pollute the
clusters medium without the side eects of requiring unusual initial mass func-
tions and stellar remnants eg Prantzos  Charbonnel 2006 Appropriate
chemo-dynamical models are required to test advantages and disadvantages of
the various hypotheses
The discovery of a second bluer Main Sequence MS in  Centauri Bedin et al
2004 together with that of multiple subgiant and red giant branch RGB se-
quences also calls for the existence of multiple stellar generations with the
additional striking surprise provided by high-resolution spectroscopy that the
bluer MS is 03 dex less metal poor than the standard red MS Piotto et al
2005 Piotto et al argue that the only way to allow for the measured colour
shift between the two MSs with the measured metallicity dierence is to let the
bluer MS be much more helium rich than the other with a dierence in the
helium mass fraction Y014 If we attribute to the red MS a primordial He
mass fraction of Y024 this implies that the blue MS should have Y038 an
abundance higher than in any other observed star cluster or galaxy 
Would AGB stars be able to provide such a huge helium enhancement  It
is very unlikely However  Centauri is denitely not a normal globular cluster
may be not a cluster at all but the remnant of a nucleated dwarf galaxy captured
and stripped by the Milky Way with the current cluster actually being the
original nucleus of the satellite Bekki  Norris 2006 have recently shown that
the observed properties of  Centauri cannot be explained without considering
Chemo-dynamical evolution models
the strong dynamical interactions with the Galaxy The actual question then is
whether the medium out of which subsequent stellar generations have formed
was enriched by  Centauri own stars or by the stars of the host dwarf originally
surrounding it Whether the polluters were AGBs massive stars or supernovae
is in this case a second level issue

We are currently modelling the chemical evolution of  Centauri Romano
et al in preparation considering it as a dwarf galaxy and following the ap-
proach presented by Romano Tosi  Matteucci 2006 hereafter RTM06 for
other dwarfs We adopt the SF history derived from the Sollima et al 2005
data and allow for both galactic winds and infall of metal poor gas The model
predictions are compared with the observational mass age-metallicity relation
metallicity distributions chemical abundances and abundance ratios In agree-
ment with Bekki  Norris results in no way are we able to obtain model predic-
tions consistent with the data if we consider  Centauri as an isolated system On
the other hand by considering it as the residual of a nucleated galaxy stripped
by the Milky Way 10 Gyr ago we reproduce rather well all the data except
the extremely high He abundance of the blue MS To achieve this goal new ad
hoc assumptions are needed and will be the subject of further eorts involving
appropriate assumptions on the fate of the stellar ejecta and new stellar yields
for both high and intermediate mass stars Our current preliminary results are
shown in Fig1
3 AGB stars as ISM polluters 3He 12C and 13C
 Centauri may require special yields and evolutionary conditions to be ex-
plained but the need of improved yields is a much more general problem Ex-
amples of important elements for which improved yields are badly needed are
the He C N and O stable isotopes
In the late nineties it has been shown eg Galli et al 1997 Tosi 2000
and references therein that to let the predictions of Galactic chemical evolution
models reproduce the low 3He abundances measured in Galactic HII regions a
mechanism is needed able to drastically reduce the 3He production normally pre-
dicted for low-mass stars Such a mechanism was suggested by eg Charbonnel
1995 and Wasserburg Boothroyd  Sackmann 1995 to be the consequence
of extra-mixing at work in RGB stars possibly as a consequence of rotation
To reconcile the low HII regions abundances with the high 3He measured in a
few Planetary Nebulae PNe the extra-mixing should aect about 90 of low
mass stars Since this extra-mixing implies not only a signicant 3He depletion
but also a larger conversion of 12C into 13C in such a large fraction of stars it
is important to check whether the corresponding yields are consistent with the
carbon ratios observed in PNe
Figure 2
From Palla et al 2000 carbon isotopic ratios measured in PNe
dots with error bars in both panels compared with stellar nucleosynthesis
predictions The curves in the left-hand panel show the ratio predicted with-
out deep-mixing just before the PN ejection by Marigo 2001 long-dashed
van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 dotted and Forestini  Charbonnel
1997 dashed The dotted curves in the right-hand panel show the ratio
predicted at the end of the RGB phase by Boothroyd  Sackman 1999
with the curves falling down to low ratios and without deep-mixing those
staying at high ratios
In Fig2 the carbon isotopic ratios measured by Palla et al 2000 in several
PNe are compared with the predictions from various theoretical yields It is ap-
parent that the standard nucleosynthesis predictions of the left-hand panels over-
Chemo-dynamical evolution models
produce the carbon ratio while the deep-mixing predictions by Boothroyd  Sackman
1999 in the right-hand panel nicely t the data This nice t is however mis-
leading because Boothroyd  Sackmans computations reach only the RGB
tip and not the nal evolutionary phases The carbon abundances can be sig-
nicantly aected by the remaining evolution Unfortunately no yields taking
deep-mixing into account have been calculated beyond the RGB and none of the
yields computed up to the nal phases include the deep-mixing eect In other
words a direct check of the existence of the extra-mixing and of the solution to
the 3He problem with all its cosmological consequences is currently unfeasible
4 AGB stars as ISM polluters nitrogen versus oxygen
Nitrogen and oxygen are important tracers of the chemical evolution of galaxies
Not only are they among the most abundant elements they are also measurable
from the emission lines of HII regions and PNe in some cases in galaxies up
to rather large distances where they are often the only available metallicity
indicators Oxygen is mainly produced by massive stars whilst nitrogen is
mostly synthesized by intermediate-mass stars In the framework of the simple
model of galaxy evolution Tinsley 1980 the enrichments of primary elements
are independent of each other whilst the growth of a secondary element goes
as the square of the growth of a primary The double nature primary and
secondary of the N production became apparent when the N and O measured
in HII regions of a number of spirals Daz  Tosi 1986 including the Milky
Way and of late-type dwarf galaxies Matteucci  Tosi 1985 were compared
with the predictions of adequate chemical evolution models a signicant fraction
between 30 and 60 of N must be primary to explain the rather at trend of
NO vs OH inferred from HII regions in both late-type dwarfs and individual
spirals The straight lines in the left-hand panel of Fig3 show least-squares
ts to the NO vs oxygen abundances derived by Daz  Tosi 1986 from the
HII regions in the Galaxy M31 M33 M101 NGC2403 and IC342 for more
accurate and updated data see Pilyugin Thuan  Vilchez 2003 The ts for
these individual spirals are overplotted on a very recent version of the NO vs
OH diagram including results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Liang et al
The NO vs OH diagram is sometimes interpreted as an evolution plot
However the oxygen abundance in abscissa cannot be taken as a proxy for time
In fact each of the plotted dots corresponds to an HII region whose abundance
reects the nal current result of the whole history of chemical enrichment in
the host galaxy region Such history is known to be quite dierent for dierent
types of galaxies since it depends on SF history gas accretion infall and loss
winds interactions with companions etc As such the position of each point
in the plot depends on the dierent evolutions of dierent galaxies and not
only on the nature primary or secondary of the N nucleosynthesis see also
Edmunds  Pagel 1978 Pilyugin Thuan  Vilchez 2003
Much attention has been payed to the metal-poor end of the NO vs OH
diagram where late-type metal-poor dwarfs are located to discuss either the
possibility of primary production of N in massive stars or the possible connection
Figure 3 NO vs OH in dierent galaxies as derived from HII region
observations dots The plot on the left-hand panel is from Liang et al
2006 and shows the SDSS data as dots The thick straight lines show the
trends in individual spirals from Daz  Tosi 1986 The right-hand panels
are blow-ups of the metal-poor region of the diagram and the lines show some
of the eects of galaxy evolution see text for details
between late-type dwarfs and Damped Lyman- systems The plots on the
right-hand side of Fig3 show some of the eects on the N and O abundances
occurring during galaxy evolution The lines shown in the two diagrams on the
right correspond to the predictions of dierent chemical evolution models for
the time behaviour of oxygen and nitrogen in a late-type dwarf galaxy The
top-right panel compares with the abundances measured from the HII regions
observed in late-type dwarfs dots the model predictions by Pilyugin 1993
for a generic Blue Compact galaxy experiencing about ten SF bursts It shows
how the HII region self-enrichment and the dierent timescales for the stellar
ejection and subsequent diusion in the ISM of oxygen and nitrogen lead to a
saw-tooth shape for the NO ratio as a function of oxygen
The bottom-right panel show instead the predictions by RTM06 for the
starburst dwarf NGC 1569 always the line with higher NO for each line-type
blue in the colour version of the gure and the Blue Compact dwarf NGC 1705
always the line with lower NO for each line-type red in the colour version of the
gure The big symbols with error bar indicate the corresponding values derived
from HII regions in NGC 1569 blue square and NGC 1705 red diamond
The other points correspond to HII regions values in other late-type dwarfs
Dierent line-types correspond to dierent assumptions on the stellar yields or
on the galactic wind eciency See RTM06 for references and details All the
lines show model predictions for the evolution of oxygen and nitrogen with time
Chemo-dynamical evolution models
and it is apparent how much the time behaviour can be dierent from a simple
t to the current NO vs OH distribution inferred from HII regions
In spite of the dierent classication NGC 1569 and NGC 1705 have
quite similar properties see eg Annibali et al 2003 Angeretti et al 2005
and references therein similar gas and star masses metallicity IMF SF his-
tory with very strong recent activity and observational evidence of similarly
strong galactic winds Yet they have quite dierent NO ratios which re-
quire dierent evolutionary assumptions The long-dashed lines in the bottom-
right panel of Fig3 show the model predictions based on the standard yields
by van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 for intermediate mass stars Clearly
a standard N production may be consistent with the NO ratio observed in
NGC 1569 but un-reconcilable with the low NO of NGC 1705
If we con-
sider yields with smaller N production even in the extreme case of those by
Meynet  Maeder
2002 where the hot-bottom burning phase has not been
computed the models overpredict the NO ratio observed in NGC 1705 short-
dashed lines A better t to the observed abundances is obtained RTM06 if
not only the nitrogen production in intermediate mass stars is relatively low
as predicted for instance by the minimal hot-bottom burning case proposed by
van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 but also a higher eciency of nitrogen
loss in the galactic wind is allowed in NGC 1705 than in NGC 1569 solid lines
Detailed chemical evolution models of individual dwarfs such as those
shown here for NGC 1569 and NGC 1705 have become possible only recently
mostly thanks to HST which has allowed to derive their SF histories back
to quite early epochs Two kinds of models for individual galaxies can be
computed standard chemical evolution models eg Carigi Colin  Peimbert
1999 Lanfranchi  Matteucci 2003 Romano Tosi  Matteucci 2006 and chemo-
dynamical models eg Recchi et al 2002 2006 The former have the drawback
of a simplistic treatment of star and SN feedbacks and gas motions the latter
have the problem that the timescales appropriate for hydrodynamics make it
prohibitive in terms of CPU time to follow the system evolution over more
than 1 Gyr The challenge in the next few years is to improve both types of ap-
proaches and get a more realistic insight of how stars and gas evolve chemically
and dynamically in their host galaxies
5 The need for improved yields
In the previous sections some examples of the uncertainties aecting the pre-
dictions of chemical evolution models have been presented Part of these uncer-
tainties are due to the lack of complete and homogenous sets of stellar yields
for various initial metallicities To compute adequate chemical evolution models
of whatever galaxy we need homogeneous chemical yields for all the major iso-
topes for the whole range of stellar masses for many initial compositions and
taking into account all the most relevant processes occurring in the stellar inte-
riors until the nal evolutionary phases Such optimal grid of yields is far from
existing The results from stellar nucleosynthesis are steadily improving with
time with most of the processes occurring during stellar evolution being treated
with increasing precision However the yields available to the community are
still very heterogeneous and incomplete and not one single set of nucleosynthesis
predictions exists taking properly into account all the processes in all the phases
of stars of all masses say from 08 to 100 M and at least 2-3 dierent metal-
licities from metal poor to solar and possibly super solar This circumstance
not only prevents the computation of detailed self-consistent chemical evolution
models for a number of key elements but can even lead to misleading results
The potential risk can be visualised by comparing with each other the yields
provided by dierent authors and the corresponding normalizations through an

and beyond 40 M
The left-hand panel of Fig4 shows a subset of the solar yields presented
by Portinari Chiosi  Bressan 1998 for massive and quasi-massive stars and
by Marigo 2001 for low and intermediate mass stars This is the best case
in literature of self-consistent yields for all masses based on the same stellar
evolution models and input physics What is normally available in the literature
is a collection of yields for partial mass ranges each computed under dierent
assumptions and often for dierent metallicities A typical case is shown in the
right-hand panel of Fig4 where the solar yields by Marigo 2001 for low and
intermediate mass stars are now combined with those by Woosley  Weaver
1995 for massive stars Two problems are immediately apparent First stars
in the mass range 5  MM  11 have not been computed by either Marigo
or Woosley  Weaver which implies that to use this combination of yields
one must interpolate over this mass interval Second massive stars do not
go beyond 40 M and to higher masses one must therefore extrapolate The
latter issue might not have overwhelming consequences in the modelling of the
recent chemical evolution of the Milky Way since any reasonable IMF predicts
Chemo-dynamical evolution models

Marigo 2001 and Woosley  Weaver 1995
very few stars more massive than 40 M but can be extremely relevant for
very early epochs when the most massive stars were the only polluters The
former problem has very serious implications because stars in the 5  11 M
range are the most eective contributors to the ISM chemical enrichment In
Fig5 the yields of Fig4 have been weighted with Tinsleys 1980 IMF The
linear interpolation performed to cover the 5  11 M interval absent in the
MarigoWoosleyWeaver combination results in a bump right-hand panel in
the contribution of these stars to the enrichment of He N and O which is totally
absent in the left-hand panel where the homogeneous sets of yields are shown
This enhanced contribution is most likely spurious and can lead to a signicant
overprediction of the elements mostly produced by stars of these masses
To overcome these problems we strongly encourage the community of stellar
nucleosynthesis experts to provide homogeneous yields for all stellar masses
computed up to the nal evolutionary phases and for several initial metallicities
