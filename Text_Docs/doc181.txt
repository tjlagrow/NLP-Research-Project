Abstract
Spitzer IRS one galaxy NGC4697 shows strong PAH emission but with an
apparently weak 77 m feature We nd that the PAH emission is conned to
the central regions of the galaxy and that once a quiescent elliptical galaxy spec-
trum is subtracted the PAH feature ratios are normal We show that the PAH
spectrum resembles the diuse ISM of our galaxy rather than an HII region and
is not indicative of a starburst galaxy We suggest that the PAHs in NGC4697
are consistent with a recent but now past burst of star formation
Introduction
Before Spitzer the few available mid-infrared spectra of elliptical galaxies only
showed silicate emission from the shells around AGB stars Athey et al 2002
so it was surprising when one of thirty normal elliptical galaxies from our Spitzer
cycle 1 proposal NGC4697 showed strong PAH emission in its IRS spectrum
Kaneda et al 2005 also found PAH emission in several galaxies chosen because
they had bright X-ray and far infrared emission and in two nearby galaxies from
the SINGS program While one of these galaxies NGC3265 showed PAH emis-
sion similar to a starburst galaxy the others showed clear emission in the 113
m PAH emission feature with a weak or absent 77 m feature Kaneda et al
2005 suggested that this could be due to emission from neutral PAHs rather
than the ionized PAHs that produce the typical PAH spectrum
In this paper we will show that the odd appearance of the PAH emission
spectrum is due to a minimum near 8 m in the underlying continuum and that
the presence of PAHs suggest star formation in the recent past
2 Data Processing
Data reduction started with the bcd data from the standard IRS data reduc-
tion pipeline at the Spitzer Science Center SSC Before performing the spectral
extraction the local background for the SL modules was subtracted using obser-
vations when the target was located in an alternate slit At longer wavelengths

since we recorded data using only the LL2 module the local background was
subtracted by dierencing the two nod positions along the slit The spectra were
then extracted from the sky-subtracted two-dimensional array images using the
SMART software package Higdon et al 2004 after the mean uxes from each
ramp cycle were combined We performed a xed column extraction because
the emission from each galaxy did not resemble the point source prole show-
ing substantial extended emission In its current form the SMART software is
optimized to perform spectral extraction and ux calibration for point source
targets In order to correct for the use of the standard ux conversion tables
which are based on point source extraction we applied a correction that accounts
for the aperture loss due to the narrowing of the extracting column as a func-
tion of wavelength used by SSC and that in turn feeds back into the FLUXCON
tables Observations of the standard star HR 6348 were used to calibrate our
target spectra A spectrum of HR 6348 was constructed combining a number
of observations recorded in 2004 under the program ID 1404 Our spectra were
calibrated by dividing the extracted spectrum of the source by the spectrum of
the standard star extracted with the same extraction parameters applied to our
target sources and multiplying by its template Cohen et al 2003
3 Discussion
The spectrum of the central region of NGC4697 is dierent than the outer re-
gion Figure 1 shows a 14 pixel wide extraction spectrum of NGC4697 upper
curve and the spectrum of just the outer regions of the galaxy lower curve
The ratio of the PAH features in the full extraction are not typical of PAH spec-
tra of objects within our galaxy or in starburst galaxies with the 77 m feature
appearing much weaker than normal
In a typical quiescent elliptical galaxy
the spectrum consists of a 5-8 m stellar continuum and a stellar continuum
with silicates superimposed longward of 8 m The outer regions of NGC4697
resemble a typical elliptical galaxy with a weak 113 m PAH feature added but
the central region is dominated by PAH emission Clearly the PAH emission is
concentrated towards the center of the galaxy However as shown in Figure
2 once the underlying stellarsilicate emission is subtracted the relative band
ratios are more normal and closely resemble the spectrum of a cirrus knot in
the diuse ISM of our galaxy The primary dierentiator between these envi-
ronments is not the PAH band ratios but rather the shape of the underlying
continuum Regions near bright UV sources HII regions and reection nebu-
lae show a continuum rising sharply longward of 15 m while the diuse ISM
spectrum represented by a knot of Cirrus emission does not show the long
wavelength rise
For the one galaxy observed by Kaneda et al 2005 to have PAH emission
that is currently available in the Sptizer archive NGC4589 subtracting an ellip-
tical galaxy template reveals a 77 m PAH feature that is not apparent in the
original data Figure 3 The 11377 m feature peak intensity ratio is about
three in this galaxy while in both the diuse ISM of our galaxy and NGC4697
the ratio is close to one The weakness of the 77 m feature relative to the
113 m feature can be explained either as a predominance of neutral PAHs
in NGC4589 as suggested by Kaneda et al 2005 as a PAH mixture that is

lacking small PAHs or as the result of a cooler radiation eld Schutte et al
1993 PAH ionization depends on the ratio of the UV eld strength to the elec-
tron density At high values of this ratio PAHs exist primarily as cations while
at low values they are primarily anions PAHs will be neutral only in a nar-
row range of this ratio and neutral PAHs may never constitute a large fraction
of the PAH population Bregman  Temi 2005 Neutral PAHs have a much
higher 11377 m feature ratio than either cations or anions The second way
to increase the 11377 m ratio is to reduce the number of small PAHs relative
to the large ones Since the number of modes in a PAH molecule is NN1
where N is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule and the energy from an
absorbed photon is spread among all of the modes the average excitation within
a large PAH is lower than in a small PAH Thus the higher energy states have
a lower population in large molecules than in smaller ones Schutte et al 1993
showed that as the result of this eect small PAHs contribute mostly to the
short wavelength features and large molecules contribute mostly to the longer
wavelength features If the small molecules are removed the shorter wavelength
features become weaker relative to the longer wavelength features The third
possibility a cooler radiation eld provides fewer high energy photons to excite
the short wavelength modes Distinguishing which mechanism is responsible for
these data is not possible with the current data set
From the comparisons shown in Figure 2 it appears that the PAH emission
in NGC4697 arises from PAHs in the diuse ISM of the galaxy not from a recent
starburst However the lifetime of PAH molecules is expected to be short in
the hot ISM of elliptical galaxies  108 years so the PAHs must have been
recently ejected into the ISM One possibility is that the spectral sequence from
strong to weak PAH emission NGC3265-NGC4697-NGC4589 is also a time
sequence In NGC3265 a starburst is currently in progress one has occurred in
NGC4697 in the recent past while in NGC4589 the remnants of the starburst are
barely detectable Recently Sambhus et al 2006 have noted that there are two
dierent kinematic groups of planetary nebulae in NGC4697 perhaps indicating
a recent merger event and Pinkney et al 2003 conclude that NGC4697 is a
candidate for a recent merger based on the presence of a central dusty disk This
same event could have set o a burst of star formation and we are now seeing
the remnants of that event via PAH emission from the ISM of the galaxy
