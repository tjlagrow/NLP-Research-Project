Oxidative stress enhances the production of inflammatory cytokines by DC We performed a proteomic

differentiation  and  maturation  Comparative  2D  gel  analysis  of  the  monocyte  immature  DC  and
mature DC stages were performed Manganese superoxide dismutase MnSOD reaches 07 of the
gel-displayed  proteins  at  the  mature  DC  stage  This  important  amount  of  MnSOD  is  a  primary
antioxidant defence system against superoxide radicals but its product H2O2 is also deleterious for
cells  Peroxiredoxin  enzymes  Prx  play  an  important  role  in  eliminating  such  peroxide  Prx1
expression  level  continuously  increases  during  DC  differentiation  and  maturation  while  Prx6
continuously decreases and Prx2 peaks at the immature DC stage As a consequence DC are more
resistant than monocytes to apoptosis induced by high amounts of oxidized low-density lipoproteins
oxLDL containing toxic organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide Furthermore DC-stimulated T
cells produce high levels of receptor activator of nuclear factor B ligand RANKL a chemotactic and
survival factor for moncocytes and DC This study provides insights into the original ability of DC to
express very high levels of antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD and Prx1 to detoxify oxLDL and to
induce high levels of RANKL by the T cells they activate and further emphasizes the role that DC
might play in atherosclerosis a pathology recognized as a chronic inflammatory disorder
 1-Introduction
Dendritic cells DC are the most potent antigen-presenting cells APC in the body and their unique
ability to stimulate a primary T-cell response places them at the centre of the immune response 1
Immature DC differentiate from bone marrow progenitors or from monocytes and then either stay in
the blood stream or migrate in the peripheral tissues Immature DC such as Langerhans cells in the
skin survey incoming pathogens They are equipped with receptors to become activated when exposed
to  pathogen  associated  molecular  patterns  PAMP  2  Their  capacity  to  recognize  pathogens  and
become activated therefore represents the first critical event in the initiation of the immune response
Encounter with a pathogen leads to DC maturation and migration through lymphatic vessels to T cell
area of secondary lymphoid organs Antigen presentation by DC activates specific naive T cells to
express  CD40  ligand  CD154  3  which  in  turn  activates  DC  achieving  their  terminal
differentiation  as  assessed  by  the  up-regulation  of  MHC-I  and  II  molecules  and  of  co-stimulatory
molecules  CD80CD86  and  by  the  production  of  cytokines  such  as  IL-12  and  IL-1  which  all
participate in T cell stimulation 3-5 and in the development of adaptive immunity 4 6 Mature DC
modulate T-cell responses through the secretion of various cytokines such as IL-12 promoting Th1-
type  cellular  immune  response  7  or  IL-4  following  thymic  stromal  lymphopoietin  activation
promoting Th2-type humoral immune response  8 Last a DC apoptosis program can be triggered at
the end of the maturation process so that mature DC do not produce an over stimulation of the immune
system  9   DC  frequently  operate  under  stress  conditions  induced  by  tissue  damage  infectious
pathogens  or  inflammatory  reactions  Oxidative  stress  enhances  the  production  of  inflammatory
cytokines by DC 10
Atherosclerosis is considered as a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial vasculature initiated by
endothelial  cell  damage  and  implicating  both  monocytes  DC  and  macrophages  that  operate  under
intense  oxidative  stress  conditions  Indeed  the  accumulation  of  oxidized  low-density  lipoproteins
oxLDL generated from native LDL trapped into the subendothelial space of the arterial wall is a
main feature of the disease and plays a key role in its progression leading to the formation of vascular
lesions 11 12 This accumulation of oxLDL induces the activation of macrophages and elicits an
oxidative burst 13  generating  toxic  components  such  as  the  superoxide  anions  derived  from  the
NADPH oxidase activity Lipid peroxides and hydrogen peroxide directly contained in oxLDL are also
toxic  per  se  14  Due  to  their  pro-oxidant  actions  superoxide  anions  resulting  from  macrophage
activation by oxLDL as well as lipid peroxides contained in the oxLDL are able to induce resident
monocytes  and  macrophages  apoptosis  14-16  This  apoptosis  is  a  commun  feature  within  early
atherosclerotic lesions 17 Superoxide anions can be reduced into H2O and O2 by combination of the
actions  of  cellular  superoxide  dismutase  SOD  and  peroxiredoxin  Prx  or  catalase  or  other
peroxidases Thus it is hypothesized that monocytes and macrophages undergo apoptosis when their
antioxidant enzymatic protection systems SOD and Prx are overflowed Contrary to monocytes and
macrophages the expression pattern of   oxidative  stress  response  proteins  in  DC  is  still  unknown
Although both immature and mature DC have been observed in the atherosclerotic plaques in close
association with activated T cells 18 and in para-aortic and jugulodigastric lymph nodes attached to
atherosclerotic  arterial  wall  19  their  exact  role  in  atherosclerosis  progression  is  still  poorly
understood These studies however suggest that vascular DC may be implicated in the local induction
of immune and auto-immune reactions 20 21
Besides  their  toxic  action  on  diverse  cell  types  OxLDL  also  increase  monocyte  adhesion  to  the
endothelial cell layer as well as their transmigration 22-24 towards adjacent tissues Finally oxLDL
trigger  the  production  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  such  as  monocyte  chemoattractant  protein-1
MCP-1 M-CSF and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor GM-CSF by endothelial
cells and stimulate monocyte differentiation into DC 25
Here  we  investigated  the  relationship  between  oxidative  stress  protein  expression  profiles  and  DC
differentiation and maturation We performed a proteomic analysis of both immature and mature DC
derived from monocytes in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF and compared it to monocyte proteome
This comparative proteomic approach revealed the original ability of DC to express high levels of
antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD and Prx These high expression levels of antioxydant enzymes
confer a great capacity to DC to resist to apoptosis induced by oxLDL mimicking the oxidative stress
microenvironment of atherosclerosis lesions Moreover when co-cultured with T cells DC produce
themselves and induce T cells to produce high levels of receptor activator of NF-B ligand RANKL
a chemotactic factor for monocytes and a key survival factor for DC 26-28 Altogether these in vitro
results suggest that DC play a crucial role in the atherosclerosis pathogenesis and in the maintenance of
its chronicity

After migration the gels were stained either with silver nitrate for 2D gels with a pH 4-8 gradient 36
or with ammoniacal silver for 2D gels with a pH 4 to 12 gradient 37  Quantitative gel analysis was
performed on the silver-stained gels with the Melanie II software Genebio Geneva Switzerland The
experiments were performed in triplicate starting with different cell batches Several gels were made
for each culture in order to select gels with very close detection signal levels for quantitative analysis
This allowed us to keep the gel analysis parameters constant for better reproducibility As a matter of
facts the total spot intensity in the analyzed gels ranged from 531400 to 662750 arbitrary absorbance
units with a mean of 600290 units ie a maximum deviation of 11

3-Results
Human monocyte-derived DC are classically CD1a and CD14- opposite to monocytes The immature
DC phenotype was attested by intermediate surface expression levels of HLA-ABC and HLA-DR and
by negative or low expression of CD25 CD83 and co-stimulatory molecules CD80 CD86 Fig 1a
Following stimulation by the bacterial-derived danger signal LPS or by the T cell-derived signal CD40-
ligand DC phenotype displayed the typical inductions of CD25 CD83 and enhancements of CD80
CD86 HLA-ABC and HLA-DR surface expressions DC differed from monocytes in their function
since they elicited allogeneic T-cell responses Fig 1b
Comparative 2D gel analysis of the monocyte immature DC and mature DC stages is shown on figures
2 and 3 The most striking and reproducible differences indicated by arrows on the figures as pulled
out from a quantitative gel image analysis were further analyzed by mass spectrometry to determine
the nature of these differentially-expressed proteins Gels with close detection sensitivity were selected
so that the detection parameters for image analysis could be kept constant and lead to close quantitative
values see methods section It is striking to note that there are relatively few reproducible differences
especially between immature and mature dendritic cells This step was our initial main focus as the
monocyte-immature dendritic cell transition had been investigated before 40 These few differences
point  to  well  known  functions  of  dendritic  cells  such  as  antigen  presentation  HLA  class  II  or
cytokine production IL1 They also point out cytoskeletal remodelling gelsolin which is obvious
when  taking  into  account  the  morphological  changes  between  monocytes  immature  and  mature
dendritic  cells  However  one  of  the  most  striking  diffferences  is  MnSOD  This  protein  has  been
previously described as heavily induced during the monocyte-immature DC transition 40 and it is
rather surprising to see that despite the high levels reached at this stage a further induction is observed
during DC maturation As MnSOD is an oxidative stress response protein which expression is often
modulated during pro-apoptotic conditions 41 or during cancer transformation 42 this oriented us
to focus our study on oxidative stress response proteins This was further reinforced by the fact that
Prx1 which is also an important oxidative stress response protein and Trx1 which plays an important
role in several cellular redox processes were also shown to be induced at both stages as MnSOD
An additional benefit of the proteomics approach in the study of peroxiredoxins is that this technology
allows  the  access  to  both  native  and  oxidized  forms  of  the  proteins  43  44  From  previously
mentioned studies we knew the positions of the various peroxiredoxins spots on the gels We however
reassessed their positions on our DC gels by mass spectrometry to further secure our identifications
Sequence  coverages  were  always  above  50  data  not  shown  thereby  providing  safe  protein
identifications The identification of the peroxiredoxins and of Mn SOD was however also secured by
MSMS analysis see supplementary material
The quantitative results obtained on oxidative stress proteins are summarized in Table 1   Although
they were identified on the gels as very minor spots indicated by arrowheads the oxidized forms of
Prx1 Prx2 and Prx6 are not mentioned in the table as they did not show any quantitative variation
along DC differentiation and maturation processes Expressions of the various proteins belonging to the
Prx family are divergent and depend on the differentiation and maturation states Some Prx decreased
moderately but steadily during the differentiation and maturation process Prx6 Prx4 while others
increased steadily Prx1 and others showed a bell-shaped expression curve Prx2 peaking at the
immature DC stage The low but steady expression level of the mitochondrial Prx3 is surprising as it is
a  mitochondrial  oxidative  stress  response  protein  as  MnSOD  However  MnSOD  is  expressed  at
much higher levels and also shows a clear induction in our biological system Finally results similar to
those obtained with CD40-ligand were also obtained upon DC maturation with LPS data not shown
In  order to confirm those results we used two different strategies One is a co-migration strategy Fig
4 Pure Prx2 purified from human red blood cells 30 was added in increasing amounts to monocytes
extracts and the spiked extracts were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and submitted to
image analysis The results obtained showed a two-fold difference between the amount of Prx2 that
should be added to mimic the intensity observed in DC eg 20ng for immature DC and the amount
that  was  deduced  from  the  quantitative  image  measurements  theoretically  40  ng   This  can  be
accounted  for  by  postulating  that  half  of  the  loaded  proteins  are  lost  in  the  4-8  two-dimensional
analysis either from proteins lying outside the separation space in pI and Mw or from proteins lost
because  of  poor  solubility  eg  membrane  proteins  Such  a  quantitative  yield  has  already  been
described 45 The second strategy is western blotting and was used for MnSOD Fig5 SDS-PAGE
gels were used to secure against any artefact arising from 2D electrophoresis The results clearly show
an induction of the protein as observed from 2D gels However the induction factors observed by
blotting  were  clearly  inferior  to  those  observed  by  2D  gel  electrophoresis  in  accordance  with  the
known non linear behavior of western blotting 46
Due to their high rate of anti-oxidant enzymes we postulated that DC are more resistant to oxidative
environments than monocytes In human advanced atherosclerosis the atherosclerotic lesions plaques
constitute an extensive oxidative environment Indeed oxLDL accumulating in these lesions trigger
the production of superoxide and peroxide by macrophages but also directly exert a toxic activity
towards different cell types because of the lipid peroxides and hydrogen peroxide they contain In vitro
experiments have previously revealed that oxLDL are toxic and apoptosis-inducing for macrophages
and smooth muscle cells 15 47 We thus studied and compared the survival capacities of both DC
and  monocytes  exposed  to  high  concentration  of  oxLDL  Cell  death  was  measured  after  24h  of
incubation by intracellular incorporation of propidium iodide The number of apoptotic monocytes
following oxLDL treatment dramatically increased in the presence of oxLDL from 12 to 76 Fig
6a  A  preliminary  dose  response  study  showed  that  monocytes  were  as  potent  as  DC  to  detoxify
oxLDL until a 50gmL concentration 30 to 35 of death When oxLDL concentration exceeded this
50gmL  threshold  more  than  873  of  monocytes  underwent  apoptosis  while  immature  DC  and
mature  DC  were  less  affected  478  and  673  of  death  respectively  Fig  6b  More  detailled
investigations working with 75gmL oxLDL doses demonstrated that immature DC and to a lower
extent  mature  DC  were  more  resistant  than  monocytes  to  the  apoptosis  induced  by  high  doses  of
oxLDL Fig 6c Thus the survival of immature DC in the oxidative stress environment generated by
oxLDL in vitro is better than monocyte survival This finding can be correlated to   their respective
expression levels of MnSOD and Prx
The enhanced capacity of immature DC to survive in an oxLDL-enriched environment compared to
monocytes  as  well  as  the  presence  of  DC-associated  T  cells  in  atherosclerosis  lesions  lead  us  to
investigate  the  production  of  RANKL  in  DCTcell  co-cultures  RANKL  is  the  ligand  of  the  TNF
receptor family member RANK expressed on T cells activated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies
48 and on memory T cells 27 It is a crucial survival factor for DC and a chemotactic factor for
monocytes  26  28  49  Moreover  RANK  and  RANKL  expressions  have  reported  in  the
atherosclerotic plaques 50 Immunofluorescent staining were used to study the expression of RANKL
on T cells co-cultured with monocytes or DC T cells co-cultured with monocytes weakly expressed
RANKL and monocytes did not express RANKL themselves In contrast T cells co-cultured for 5 days
with  DC  strongly  expressed  RANKL  on  their  surface  Interestingly  DC  also  displayed  RANKL
expression  Fig  7  Consequently  besides  MnSOD  and  Prx  overexpressions  DC-induced  RANKL
expression may also be a key parameter accounting for a role of DC in atherosclerosis pathogenesis
4-Discussion
Because  of  their  outstanding  interest  in  immunology  gene  expression  in  DC  has  been  studied  in
details  both  at  the  monocyte-immature  DC  transition  40  51  and  at  the  immature-mature  DC
transition  52  53  Proteomic  study  complementing  the  latter  transcriptomic  studies  on  DC
maturation was required We focussed our study on a major protein induction observed in proteomics
MnSOD reaches by combining the two major MnSOD spots 07 of the gel-displayed proteins at the
mature DC stage This important amount oriented us to study the oxidative stress response pathways
MnSOD is up-regulated by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators such as TNF-  LPS IL-1 and
IFN- 54 55 Therefore the observed induction of MnSOD protein can be correlated with its well-
documented role as an anti-apoptotic protein 41 56 The main activity of MnSOD enzyme is to
reduce anion superoxides into hydrogen peroxides Together with glutathione peroxidase and catalase
Prx enzymes play an important role in eliminating peroxides 57 which are produced by numerous
pathways including the dismutation of superoxide For example Prx1 and Prx2 are involved in the
removal of H2O2 in thyroid cells and can protect these cells from undergoing apoptosis 58 Only a
moderate increase of DC apoptosis was observed in the presence of H2O2 59 probably due to their
high Prx expression Strikingly H2O2 rather seems to be an activating signal for DC as it stimulates
their production of IL-8 and TNF- in a dose-dependent manner 10
The  high  amount  of  antioxidant  enzymes  awards  DC  the  ability  to  survive  in  highly  oxidant
environment This also correlates with the anti-apoptotic effects observed upon DC maturation 60
Recent studies demonstrated that oxLDL promote DC differentiation from monocytes 25 whereas
oxLDL induce apoptosis of human macrophages a main feature in the first steps of atherogenesis 61
As oxLDL produce both organic peroxides and hydrogen peroxide 14 it was interesting to study the
changes in Prx expression during DC differentiation and maturation In this case the proteomic study
is especially well-suited as the native and oxidatively-inactivated forms of Prx can be separated on 2D
gels 43 44 In the case of DC differentiation and maturation we did not notice any changes in these
oxidized forms which were present at very low amounts However interesting quantitative findings
could be made on the normal forms of Prx First of all the relative amounts of the various Prx are very
different Mitochondrial Prx3 was always expressed at low levels However among the cytosolic Prx
Prx1 2 and 6 Prx2 is expressed at much lower level than Prx1 or Prx6 in monocytes 350 versus
above 2000 ppm while this is not the case in Jurkat cells where Prx6 is almost undetectable 43 or
in  HeLa  cells  where  Prx2  is  expressed  at  much  higher  levels  44  Prx2  counteracts  the  NF-B
pathway 57 required for DC maturation 60 It is therefore not surprising to find low levels of Prx2
in mature DC and more generally low levels of Prx2 in the monocyte-DC lineage compared to other
haematopoietic lineages 62
It is generally believed that all mammalian cytosolic peroxiredoxins have similar substrate specificity
and are thus able to destroy both hydrogen peroxide and organic peroxides 63  In terms of peroxide
destruction the total cytosolic peroxiredoxin amount ie Prx1  Prx2  Prx6 increases from 4800
ppm at the monocyte stage to 7500 ppm at the immature DC stage and to 9300 ppm at the mature DC
Although Prx6 also exhibit other different actions which may alter this simplistic scheme our results
suggests that the Prx defence line is induced steadily during the DC differentiation and maturation
This overall increase however masks divergent quantitative changes in the cytosolic peroxiredoxins
upon  DC  differentiation  and  maturation  which  is  the  most  surprising  part  of  our  data  Prx1
continuously increases during this process close to 3 fold while Prx6 continuously decreases 2 fold
and Prx2 peaks at the immature DC stage
An interesting trend is provided by the dual function of Prx6 which is at the same time a peroxiredoxin
and a phospholipase A2 PLA2 64 Thus a decrease in Prx6 amount also means a decrease in PLA2
activity Easily oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids are often found at the 2-position in phospholipids
and are therefore liberated by PLA2 activity Inhibition of PLA2 can be of physiological interest since
it  prevents  the  rise  of  lysophosphatidylcholine  levels  and  diminishes  the  death-inducing  effects  of
oxLDL on monocytes 65 Apart from the context of oxidized lipids it must be kept in mind that Prx6
is also an activator of NADPH oxidase 66 which is active in DC and especially mature ones 67 All
these factors may explain the reorientation from Prx6 to Prx1 occurring during DC differentiation and
maturation
In a more general frame our data concerning monocytes and DC survival in an oxLDL-enriched stress
environment  can  not  be  directly  correlated  to  the  global  cellular  expression  levels  of  anti-oxidant
enzymes  Prx   Indeed  mature  DC  which  have  the  highest  contents  in  Prx  are  more  sensitive  to
oxLDL-induced apoptosis than immature DC Cell survival to oxLDL-induced death correlates rather
well with the cytosolic amount of Prx-2 This is rather surprising as the various mammalian Prx are
known to be able to reduce the same scope of peroxides in vitro 63 However it must be kept in mind
that  Prx  interact  with  multiple  and  different  partners  68  These  other  interactions  may  alter  their
operational efficiency either by altering their catalytic efficiency or by segregating some types of Prx
away from the peroxide substrates generated by oxLDL expecially lipid hydroperoxides This may
explain why reistance to oxLDL correlates with the expression of one particular Prx and not with the
total Prx amount
Concerning the role of DC in atherosclerosis it is now accepted that mature DC which are known to
be  present  in  advanced  plaques  69  contribute  to  plaque  destabilization  especially  through  T  cell
activation and CD40CD40L interactions play a key role in atherosclerosis progression 70 Besides
being implicated in the induction of local immune  or auto-immune responses  our results indicate that
when interacting with T cells  DC produce the cytokine RANKL themselves and induce its production
by  T  cells  RANKL  also  called  osteoprotegerin-ligand  OPGL  or  TNF-related  activation-induced
cytokine  TRANCE  is  a  chemotactic  factor  for  monocytes  together  with  MCP-1  produced  by
endothelial  cells  following  oxLDL  stimulation  in  atherosclerosis  RANKL  expression  has  been
detected in advanced calcified lesions of atherosclerosis 50 Thus DC and T cell-derived RANKL
might also enhance the recruitment of monocytes from blood towards the atherosclerosis lesions
RANKL also plays important roles in DC homeostasis RANKL-RANK interaction has been shown to
sustain DC survival by inducing the anti-apototic gene Bcl-xL 28 Skin CD1a DC express RANK
but  lack  RANKL  and  are  short-lived  However  they  can  be  rescued  from  cell  death  either  by
recombinant soluble RANKL or by RANKL DC generated in vitro from CD34 progenitors 28 In
addition to enhancing DC survival RANKL induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-
6 IL-1 and T cell growth and differentiation factors IL-12 IL-15 by DC in vitro 27 RANKL also
provides co-stimulation required for efficient CD4 T cell priming during viral infection in the absence
of CD40LCD40 49 71 These data further suggest that besides recruiting more monocytes to the
atherogenic plaque RANKL produced locally may also increase DC lifespan in the plaque and amplify
their functions then contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis
In conclusion DC recruitment maturation and survival may be critical factors for the progression of
atherosclerosis i DC recruitment into the vascular wall is increased by atherogenic stimuli such as
oxLDL TNF- and hypoxia 72 ii DC maturation is induced by different atherogenic stimuli such
as superoxide oxLDL lysophosphatidylcholine nicotine angiotensin II atrial natriuretic peptide and
TNF-  7-10  73  74  iii  DC  survival  in  the  atherosclerotic  plaque  environment  is  a  third
important  factor  enabling  these  professional  antigen  presenting  cells  to  induce  a  more  important
antigen-specific T cell activation The high anti-oxidant enzyme expression levels the better resistance
to  oxLDL-induced  apoptosis  and  the  production  of  RANKL  upon  DCT  cell  interactions  that  we
highlighted  in  this  work  are  three  elements  which  further  implicate  DC  in  the  pathogenesis  of
atherosclerosis and emphasize the role they may play in the amplification of the chronic inflammation
together with hypercholesterolemia and oxidative stress This role of DC in atherosclerosis progression
was recently further supported by   observations indicating that oxLDL and platelet-activating factor
contained in the lesions locally activate DC but inhibit their migration to draining lymph nodes 75
This activated-DC sequestration in addition to enhanced DC survival may further aggravate the local
inflammation

mature DC p05 and Prx6 between monocytes and immature DC p01
 Mn SOD can be measured on pH 4-12 and on pH 4-8 gradients The values are those obtained on pH
4-8 gradients
  Prx 1 can be measured only on pH 4-12 gradients All other Prx are measured on pH 4-8 gradients
