It is argued that Hawking radiation has indeed been measured and shown to posses a thermal
spectrum as predicted This contention is based on three separate legs The rst is that the
essential physics of the Hawking process for black holes can be modelled in other physical systems
The second is the white hole horizons are the time inverse of black hole horizons and thus the
physics of both is the same The third is that the quantum emission which is the Hawking process
is completely determined by measurements of the classical parameters of a linear physical system
The experiment conducted in 2010 fulls all of these requirements and is thus a true measurement
of Hawking radiation
INTRODUCTION
In 1974 Hawking 1 predicted one of the most surprizing phenomena in gravitational physics and possibly in physics
in general That prediction was that black holes objects whose spacetime structure was such that no radiation could
propagate even in principle from inside the object to an outside observer nevertheless produced radiation which
gradually shrank the size of the black hole Furthermore that outgoing radiation had the spectrum of black body
radiation modied by an albedo factor The temperature of the radiation for a non-rotating charged black hole
was given by
where kB is Boltzmanns constant G is Newtons gravitational constant h is Plancks constant c the velocity of light
and M the mass of the black hole
That the so called albedo was just that and not a frequency dependent temperature was demonstrated by showing
that a black hole connected to a heat bath well outside the black hole would be in equilibrium if that outside
temperature were given by that temperature This equilibrium is the so called Hartle Hawking vacuum
That black holes could radiate was the rst shock Where did these emitted particles come from They could not
come from inside the black hole since nothing can travel faster than light and even light cannot escape from inside If
they come from outside the horizon exactly what creates them out there The second shock was that this radiation
was thermal What causes this temperature Does this mean that black holes are thermodynamic objects like other
hot objects Do they have entropy and what is the relation of the entropy of black holes to other forms of entropy
Is the second law of thermodynamics valid when this entropy is taken into account
All of these questions have been some of the foremost topics in theoretical physics in the years since Hawkings
result and are questions which still do not have universally accepted answers
However if one examines Hawkings original calculation there are some severe problems with his derivation While
mathematically unimpeachable they are nonsense physically The reason is intimately tied to the fact that nothing
can escape from a black hole Therefor if one looks at that emitted radiation and asks where it must have come
from since it is travelling away from the black hole now it must have been closer to the black hole in the past But
it cannot have been inside the black hole The equations for quantum eld theory used to predict the radiation say
that as time unwinds into the past that radiation must have been closer and closer to the horizon squeezed into a
shorter and shorter distance and thus a shorter and shorter wavelength This is an exponential process so that the
wavelength decreases exponentially with the time into the past with a time scale crudely set by the light crossing
time of the black hole ie the time taken for light to travel a distance equal to the circumference of the black hole
This process continues until nally one arrives at the time in the past when the black hole formed presumably by
the collapse of matter That radiation then came through the centre of the collapsing star from the space outside
the collapsing star
Thus if one follows Hawkings calculation and one looks for the origins of that thermal radiation in the behaviour of
the eld in the distant past the past aspects of the quantum eld which creates the current radiation had wavelengths
c2 etc34GM and frequencies of order
GM etc34GM  Thus one second after a solar mass black hole forms
of order GM
the radiation produces by whatever the process is that produces Hawking radiation originated from frequencies in
the initial state of the uncollapsed system of order e105
 a number so absurdly large that any imaginable units would
simply produce an insignicant change in that exponent And the later the radiation one is considering is emitted
the larger and more absurd this factor becomes
There is simply no way that the physical assumptions namely that the quantum eld which produces this radiation
propagates linearly on the background unaltered spacetime can be correct Those frequencies which are needed to
explain the radiation produced even one second after a solar mass black hole forms correspond to energies which are
times the energy of the whole universe Such waves simply will not propagate with no eect on the background
spacetime and will certainly not propagate as though the black hole were unaected by its presence That these
uctuations are vacuum uctuations should make no dierence to this observation
The question thus arises if the derivation relies on such absurd physical assumptions can the result be trusted
If the physics of the emission process really does depend on the physics of the eld at those frequencies then surely
one can regard the eect as at best highly speculative and and at worst almost certainly wrong
When it was discovered this process was seen to be something unique to black holes Without a complete theory
of quantum gravity it would seem that one could not make any progress toward understanding this process But
in 1980 while teaching a course in uid mechanics I realised that there might be another way of approaching the
problem Many waves including sound waves in a uid have a behaviour at low frequencies and long wavelengths
which is almost identical to that of relativistic elds in a spacetime Already in the 1920s Gordon2 had realised
that at low frequencies and long wavelengths sound waves obey equations which obey a special relativity set of
transformations of space and time If the background uid were forced to ow then that background ow would alter
the equations of motion of the sound waves in precisely the same way that a non-at spacetime metric would alter the
equations of motion for elds in the spacetimes corresponding to Einsteins theory of gravity3 In particular if one
modelled the equations of motion of sound waves as an irrotational  v1  0 where v1 is the rst order perturbation
of the ow away from the background ow v perturbation of the uid then the velocity potential dened by v1  
obeyed exactly the equations of motion of a scalar eld in a metric
where in the case of the uid the metric coecients were given by
pgg    0
pgg  cid18
vjij  vivj
cid19
Here g is the inverse of the determinant of the matrix g and c is the velocity of sound in the uid q p
  which
may depend on position and time
Since one can easily imagine the uid somewhere owing faster than the velocity of sound sound waves from inside
the surface on which the radial velocity of the uid is equal to the velocity of sound cannot escape that region just
as light cannot escape the black hole The metric whose components are the inverse of the matrix g can contain
a horizon which is the exact analog of the horizon of a black hole
By following Hawkings derivation line by line for a uid ow which accelerates to create such a horizon one
predicts that the quantum sound waves in such a uid ow should also create quantum particles around the horizon
which should again have a temperature in this case proportional to
c2  v2
evaluated on the surface where c2  v238 
Again if one remains in the hydrodynamic approximation the derivation suers from the same diculties as does
that for the black hole radiation namely that the radiation appears to depend on absurdly high frequencies and short
wavelengths in the initial state of the system
Unlike for gravity however for uids we understand the short wavelength high frequency physics at least in
principle Fluids are made of molecules and once the wavelength of the sound waves becomes comparable to the
distance between the molecules the hydrodynamic approximation fails The equation of motion of the uid particles
are no longer continuum equations but become nite dierence type equations assuming we can neglect special
relativistic eects While at wavelengths much longer than the inter-atomic spacing continuum eld theory type
approaches are valid at short wavelengths they no longer suce It was recognized by Jacobson6 that one of the
FIG 1 The sound waves emitted by a yelling sh as it goes over a waterfall which goes supersonic at the red line Just as for
a black hole beyond the sonic horizon the sound waves are swept over the falls with the sh Note that the appendages on
the heads of the sh are ears not ns since these sh experience the world through sound not sight
key eects that this atomicity had was on the dispersion relation of the small uctuations about some equilibrium
ow of the uid In a uid at rest the relation between the frequency and wavelength was no longer the simple
where  is the frequency and  the wavelength but  has a much more complex relation to 
  c
cid19
  F cid18 1
where F is some potentially complicated function of 1
 such that at large  F becomes a linear funtion with slope
c The phase velocity F  and group velocity 2 F
 both will dier from c for small  One can thus take a rst
step at understanding the dependence of the thermal radiation on the nature of the theory of the waves at short
wavelengths by examining the behaviour of the prediction under changes in the dispersion relation of the waves at
short wavelengths
In a uid with such a dispersion relation changes we can again ask What aspect of the state of the uid in the
past results in the thermal nature of the radiation emitted now The outgoing wave-packet projected back from the
future is that as time unrolls into the past the packet gets closer to the horizon and its wavelength decreases just as
in the back hole model Howevereventually its wavelength becomes small enough that the dispersion relation and
thus the group velocity of the wave changes That wave-packet can no longer stay near the horizon where the velocity
of the uid is now dierent from the changed velocity of the wave As one goes back further into the past that wave
packet must have come from either inside the horizon if the dispersion relation is such that the group velocity of the
waves increases as the wavelength decreases or outside if the group velocity decreases as the wavelength decreases
This stops the exponential change in wavelength that the horizon brings about The system has a natural cuto to
the decrease in the wavelength caused by the horizon The radiation emitted now comes from aspects of the quantum
eld the sound eld in the past which have much shorter but not absurdly shorter than the wavelengths now The
wavelengths are not determined by an exponential of the time since the formation of the horizon but rather by the
dispersion relation It is when the dispersion relation changes from the long wavelength relativistic regime to the
cuto regime where the atomicity of matter becomes important
A variety of numerical studies eg early ones are Unruh5 and Corley and Jacobson7 but see the references
in Barcelo et al Living Reviews article 8 have shown that this system will still emit thermal quantum radiation
Changes in the short wavelength dispersion relation have no or only a very small eects on the temperature or
thermal spectrum of the radiation emitted
However as always in physics experiments are the nal arbiter Do other physical eects viscosity in the uid
turbulence etc alter that thermal spectrum
Since h is so small quantum eects like Hawkings prediction will always be very small Is it possible to measure
such eects For uids with typical laboratory velocities of meters per second and changes on the scale of cm the
x  1010K This is clearly extremely
temperature of the radiation would be expected to be of the order of
dicult to measure directly However as Hawkings calculation already showed the quantum emission follows directly
from the classical behaviour of the system Nowhere except at the very end his calculation did quantum mechanics
play any role
FIG 2 The numerical result of of calculating the the thermal factor for a dispersive horizon If the waves obey the thermal
hypothesis the three curves should be the same which they are except possibly at the longest wavelengths where the size of
the calculation region is or the order of the wavelength and the calculation is unreliable 5
For any linear system the classical and the quantum behaviour and classical equations and the quantum Heisenberg
equations of motion are identical It is only the interpretation of the symbols that occur in the calculation that dier
Instead of the eld values  and conjugate momentum  being interpreted as ordinary function having some distinct
real value at a point in spacetime those symbols represent linear operators operating on a Hilbert space Those
operators obey non-trivial commutation relations and it is those commutation relations that dierentiate the classical
and the quantum systems
II EXPERIMENT
In 2010 a group at the University of British Columbia Silke Weinfurtner Ted Tedford Matt Penrice Greg
Lawrence and I a group of theoretical physicists and civil engineers11 carried out an experiment to measure the
spectrum of radiation produced by a horizon in an analog system following a suggestion of Schutzhold and Unruh9
The system of interest was water owing in a ume  a long narrow tank down which water ows We had a 6m
long tank with a width of about 15cm down which water with a depth of about 20cm owed At the outow end
the water fell into a large storage tank From this tank the water was pumped to the other end of the ume where
it entered the ume through a pipe and owed through a progression of screens These screen were to smooth out
the ow of the water so that the ow in the rest of the tank was as laminar as possible  the screens convert gross
turbulence into small scale turbulence which is rapidly damped out by the viscosity of the water
Along the ume is a smooth aeroplane wing shaped obstacle on the bottom which forces the water to ow more
rapidly over the top of the obstacle The exit slope of the obstacle was adjusted to ensure that there was no stagnation
in the ow as it left the obstacle The ow was measured using Particle Image Velocimetry in which neutrally
buoyant particles are introduced into the water and their velocity measured by taking high resolution photographs
of the particles illuminated by two closely spaced laser ashes to ensure that ow separation did not occur This
showed that although the ow was laminar throughout as the ow can down the trailing edge of the obstacle there
was a decrease of the velocity with depth to about 50 of the velocity along the top of the stream
In the experiment we were interested in measuring the surface waves along the top of the ow These surface waves
are the analog of the eld in the background metric determined both by the background ow of the water and the
varying depth of the water since the surface wave velocity depends on depth In order to measure the depth we
needed to accurately measure the surface of the water We did this by dissolving the dye rhodamin-C in the water
and illuminating a narrow strip of the water with a green 5W laser whose beam was spread out to a length of about
2m along the surface and width of about 1mm The rhodamine-C had a sucient density in the water than the mean
FIG 3 Diagram of the ume with the obstacle and the wave generator The water falls over the weir at the end and is
recirculated by the pump The laser light is a narrow sheet 2 meters long and about 1mm wide along the centre of the ume
from the top of the obstacle downstream11
path of the light in the dyed water was only about 1mm After absorbing the light the dye uoresced with a broad
peak below the frequency of the green laser Since the uorescence was isotropic this produced light in all directions
including almost perpendicular to the laser light beam The laser light itself tended to either specularly reect at the
surface or refract neither of which produced light in the perpendicular direction The uorescence also destroyed
the temporal and spatial coherence of the emitted light and thus did not suer from the speckle problem that
visualization under laser light usually produces
The bright surface uorescent emission was then photographed with a digital camera BW to obtain the maximum
resolution that the number of pixels could produce and with a 1980x1094 resolution so that the full 2m illumination
by the laser could be recorded
Because of the softness of the lens the focal resolution of the lens would smear out a point source of light to a size
slightly larger than one pixel one could determine the location of maximum brightness in the image to much better
than 1 pixel by interpolation of the peak intensity from the pixels immediately adjacent to that brightest pixel This
gave a resolution of about 15 of a pixel Since the pixels themselves had a size of about 1mm when projected onto
the waters surface this gave a single pixel resolution from the photographs of about 2mm in the vertical direction
Horizontal resolution was not as important since the wavelengths of the waves of interest were of the order of 10s of
cm After averaging by taking Fourier transforms of the surface waves we could reliably detect waves on the surface
with amplitudes down to about 01mm
This surface resolution was important in that it allowed us to use very low amplitude waves in our experiments to
ensure that we remained within the linear regime of wave propagation As is well known waves propagating up a
shoaling beach have their amplitude amplied because of the decreasing velocity of the waves See for example the
height and breaking of tsunami waves as they hit land compared to their few cm height in the deep open ocean
The experiment we carried out was not on the analog of black hole horizons but rather on the analog of white hole
horizons White hole horizons are the time reverse of black hole horizons Whereas a black hole horizon is a surface
out of which no waves can come a white hole horizon is one into which no waves can penetrate Since physics is time
symmetric the physics of and the quantum emission by white hole horizons is the same as the time inverse of black
hole horizons However while in at a black hole horizon the quantum Hawking process creates low frequency long
wavelength outgoing modes for a white hole horizon the particles created are the time inverse As argued above the
originating modes which create the Hawking radiation in the past were ultra high frequency ultra short wavelength
modes In the inverse Hawking process it is these modes which are created Fortunately in the analog systems the
dispersion relations ensure that these modes do not have the absurdly high frequencies or absurdly short wavelengths
that they do for the black holes
Thus the creation process for modes of the white hole analog horizons in our experiment will create modes with
short wavelengths which turn out to be about 20cm in our case The corresponding black hole modes would have
wavelengths of many 10s of meters which would be extremely dicult to measure in our 6m tank of which only 2m
was illuminated
Thus we had a wave generator which consisted of a wire screen which was immersed more or less deeply into the
water ow downstream of the obstacle This screen would more or less impede the ow producing a wave which would
travel upstream toward the obstacle If the water ow depth was appropriately adjusted  by means of the vertical
weir a adjustable vertical plate at the end of the tank then the upstream travelling waves would not travel over
the barrier They were blocked The obstacle would both slow down the waves  whose wavelength was suciently
long that their velocity was gh where here g is the acceleration of gravity and h is the depth of the water As
the water shoals the wave velocity decreased h get smaller while the velocity of the water increased due to the
incompressibility of the water and the conservation of mass for the water ow the velocity of the water times the
depth is essentially constant Thus if the depth of the water is properly adjusted by the weir at the end of the tank
the velocity of the waves is less than the velocity of the water over the obstacle and no waves could penetrate the
region over the obstacle The waves are blocked At the blocking point the point where the group velocity of the
waves equalled the speed of the water the waves cannot simply disappear Instead as in a black hole they pile up
there with their wavelength steadily decreasing The dispersion relation of the surface waves
  pgk tanhkh
where k  2
 is the wave number and  is the angular temporal frequency of the surface waves means that when
the wavelength became small enough the group velocity of the waves will drop below the velocity of the water and
the waves are swept away from the blocking point
If we assume that the uid ow is steady time independent then for the small linear waves travelling over the
surface of the uid the frequency of those waves in the lab frame will be constant With the dispersion relation in
the still uid given by the above the dispersion relation in owing uid will be
  pgk tanhkh  vk
While this equation assumes a constant velocity v it should also be a reasonable approximation as long as v does
not change too fast Thus at any point in the ow there will in general be three possible values of k for any small
enough value of  as long as v is not too large In gure 4 we plot the above dispersion relation for two values of v
corresponding to dierent locations in the ow In the slowly owing uid we have chosen a value of  such that
there are three possible values of k The smallest value k
dk  the slope of
the curve which are both positive  taken in this case to refer to velocities to the left This corresponds to the long
wavelength ingoing wave The other two solutions in the slow water regime k
o with much shorter wavelengths both
have negative slopes  negative group velocities which correspond to waves dragged away from the horizon k
positive phase velocity  and k
i has a phase velocity vp  
k and vG  d
o are both positive while k
o has negative phase velocity
If we look at waves in the shallow high-velocity region there is only one solution to the dispersion relation with
that same value of  That wave has negative group and phase velocities ie directed to the right toward the
horizon Thus both this wave k
i represent waves
travelling toward the horizon while both the short wavelength waves in the deeper water are travelling away
 and the long wavelength possibility in the deeper water regime k
When one send a long wavelength wave at the horizon from the right it will eventually be stopped by the ow and
be converted into the two outgoing short wavelength waves No outgoing wave can enter into the fast ow region
because there is no solution there with group velocity away from the horizon there do exist waves with imaginary
wave-number there of course which would correspond to exponentially damped solutions and which would in general
be needed to satisfy the boundary conditions at the horizon
What we measured in our experiment was precisely that conversion of the ingoing waves into outgoing waves In
particular the amplitudes of those various outgoing waves was the crucial output of this experiment
III NORM
Before continuing with the description of the experiment I must return to quantum mechanics The above experi-
ment sounds completely classical But the Hawking eect is surely a quantum eect h occurs in the formula for the
temperature How could this classical experiment have anything to do with quantum mechanics

the incoming waves ki The wave k

ratio of Bogoliubov coecients and should have a thermal character if the Hawking analysis is correct In our experiment the
mode corresponding to k
is generated and the amplitudes of the resultant waves k
o is a negative norm wave and k
o and k
o are measured
since the Hamiltonian is real and thus if qi i is a solution so is its complex conjugate
This norm is not positive denite and the norm of real solutions is zero However one can choose a set of solutions
i  which have positive norm are orthogonal to each other and to the associated set of complex conjugate solution
and such that the whole set of solutions are a complete set of solutions We will call this set the positive and negative
norm mode solutions If the qi are normalized  qx qy  xy and we dene annihilation and creation operators
ax ax such that
then the quantum operators
ax ay  xy
Qi  Xx
i  axqx
i  iXx
axqx
i  axqx
obey the standard equal time commutation relations
Qit j t  iij
Ie these operators obey the Heisenberg equations of motion for the Hamiltonian because the solutions qx
i all do
and obey the commutation relations for conguration and conjugate momentum
If we know what the classical solutions of the equations of motion are we also know what the full solutions to the
quantum system are
The Bogoliubov coecients are the relation between the ingoing modes and the outgoing modes In particular if
and ingoing positive norm mode i is converted into a linear combination of outgoing positive and negative norm
IV RESULTS
FIG 5 The plot11 of the intensities of the radiation as a function of wave-number for the waves incident on the barrier
The peak near k  0 is the incoming wave while the two peaks one at positive and one at negative k represent the positive
and negative norm waves produced by the interaction of the incoming wave with the horizon Note that the wavelengths of the
incoming waves are much longer than the illuminated region of the top of the water the waves are travelling over an uneven
bottom and there is no wavelength matching of the analyzed region making the peaks broad even though only one frequency
was incoming The logarithm of the ratio of the intensities is plotted in the other graph If the thermal hypothesis is correct
then that plot should be a straight line which to experimental accuracy it is Unfortunately the temperature corresponding

Thus this experiment give strong support to the hypothesis that horizons whether black hole sonic or other will
produce a quantum noise with a thermal spectrum whose temperature is determined by the behaviour of the horizon
What remains Clearly it would also be good to be able to directly see the thermal quantum noise created by a
horizon As in the above experiment this is extremely dicult The temperature scales directly with the velocity
V FUTURE
of the waves and inversely with the scale over which the horizon is created This suggests that horizons which are
created by light high velocity and thus high temperature are preferable and also horizons which are created over
very short length scales are prefered One suggestion is that one look at non-linear eects in optical media to create
horizons Schuetzhold and I12 made described one possibility in which the eective velocity of electromagnetic waves
in a wave guide could be altered and used to create a moving horizon This was extended by Leonhardt13 who
suggested using the non-linear Kerr eect  the change in the refractive index of a transparent medium by an intense
pulse of radiation in the medium One would use an intense pulse at one frequency to change the refractive index for
a dierent frequency such that at that other frequency the velocity of the pulse was higher than the velocity of the
light within that pulse This would create a black holewhite hole pair of horizons in the rest frame of the pulse This
is probably the experiment which is closest to fruition but still faces immense obstacles The because of the weak
non-linearities of any known medium the intensity of the pulse which changes the refractive index need to be so high
that it begins to damage the material if it is to create a suciently large change in the index of refraction within the
pulse This damage can created radiation noise in a broad range of frequencies14 However the hope is that in the
next 10 years or less the rst direct detection of radiation created by an analog horizon will have been seen15
Furthermore in the analog experiment which we carried out the behaviour of the waves was in some sense too
predictable The modes were all in a regime in which the physics is reasonably well understood if we ignore turbulence
and viscose eects It would be great if one could carry out an experiment where at least some of the modes were
in a regime in which the physics was poorly understood For example in liquid He sound waves or rather modes
of vibration whose wavelengths are comparable to the inter-atomic spacing in the liquid are very poorly understood
If one could run an experiment in which the black hole horizon radiation originated with modes which lay within
that region of atomic wave-length sound waves it would strengthen the evidence that the thermal radiation from
horizons really was as ubiquitous as it seems to be Unfortunately such experiments still seem a long way o
It is of course true that even the direct observation of thermal quantum radiation from an analog horizon does
not prove that black holes will radiate Something could make the gravitational system behave dierently from any
analog system It is however very hard to imagine what that something could be The derivation of the thermal
radiation from analog horizons follows so closely the derivation of thermal radiation from black hole horizons that it
is very hard to imagine how the one could occur but not the other
However our rst experimental demonstration that a horizon produces a thermal spectrum together with the very
elementary arguments that for linear systems the classical behaviour determines the quantum behaviour is at least
a rst step to solidifying the truth of Hawkings observation that horizons are associated with thermal radiation
despite the problematic nature of his original derivation
