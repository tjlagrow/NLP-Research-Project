Abstract. We consider star formation properties of dwarf galaxies in Cen A group observed
within our HST/ACS projects number 9771 and 10235. We model color-magnitude diagrams of
the galaxies under consideration and measure star formation rate and metallicity dependence
on time. We study environmental dependence of the galaxy evolution and probable origin of the
dwarf galaxies in the group.

1. Introduction
Centaurus A is one of the nearest group of galaxies at the mean distance of 3.77 Mpc
from us. The Cen A/M 83 region is particularly interesting because one of the dominant
galaxies Cen A is a giant elliptical. The only other nearby large elliptical galaxy is the
highly obscured Maﬀei 1. The Cen A group is probably more dynamically evolved than
others in the Local Volume, like Local group or M 81 group, which have a spiral galaxy
as central body. At the distance of Cen A group galaxies are well resolved into individual
stars including old giant branch stars up to an age of 10 to 13 Gyr. The Centaurus A
group contain 31 members or probable members (Karachentsev 2005, AJ 129, 178).
2. The dataset and the method
Over the last several years members of our team participated in two snapshot surveys
of nearby galaxies using WFPC2 aboard HST, which have provided us with the material
for distances of ∼ 10% accuracy for about 150 nearby galaxies (proj. 8192 and 8601).
Further signiﬁcant progress has been made with HST/ACS pointed observations (proj.
9771 and 10235). Most of known dwarf members of the Cen A/M 83 complex were imaged
within the framework of these projects. Here we present star formation history (SFH)
determination from color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of resolved stars in 14 dwarf
galaxies in the Cen A group (see Fig.1). The galaxies span absolute B magnitude range
of [−10 ÷ −16]. HST/ACS images of these objects were taken with F606W (broadband
V) and F814W (broadband I) ﬁlters. Photometry of resolved stars in the galaxies was
made with the DOLPHOT package for crowded ﬁeld photometry (Dolphin 2000, PASP
112, 1383). Photometric distances for all galaxies in the sample were obtained using Tip
of the Red Giant Branch distance indicator (Karachentsev et al. 2007, AJ 133, 504).
We have created a program to analyze our large and homogeneous sample of galaxies
(Makarov & Makarova 2004, Ap 47, 229). We construct synthetic CMDs from theoretical
stellar isochrones taking into account the initial mass function, galaxy distance, Galactic
extinction and photometric errors. Photometric uncertainties and completeness values
Makarova L., Makarov D.
were added using results of artiﬁcial star tests. A linear combination of synthetic CMDs
of diﬀerent ages and metallicities forms a model CMD. For SFH determination we have
to ﬁnd a best linear combination of partial model CMDs to match the observed data.
We construct a maximum-likelihood function for this task.
3. Results
Color-magnitude diagrams and star formation histories of two dwarf galaxies in the
Cen A group are shown in Fig.2 to represent our sample. The dIrr galaxy Cen 6 is
situated on the outskirts of the Cen A group. We can see sparsely populated blue and
red supergiant branches, AGB stars and upper red giant branch at the CMD. At least
two star formation episodes can be distinguished (right panel): the ancient one, about
12–13 Gyr ago with low metallicity and more recent about 10–800 Myr ago with the
metallicity probably up to solar. The CMD of the dSph galaxy KK 197 contain well
populated old RGB and some intermediate age AGB stars. The galaxy has unusual RGB
color scatter, which reﬂects active star formation episode of very high metallicity level
about 0.4–1 Gyr ago, whereas ancient burst of star formation has low metallicity. It is
worth to note, that only brightest part of stellar population of the galaxies can be seen,
that puts some restrictions to details of our modeling.
Several star formation features can be recognized from our measurements (see repre-
sentative set in Fig.3). First, most galaxies demonstrate two distinct (and similar) star
formation episodes. An ancient episode has an age of about 10–13 Gyr and low metal
abundance. The galaxies under study also show enhanced star formation about 0.1–10
Gyr ago. Dwarf irregulars has some ongoing star formation, too. Second, several dwarfs
under study have unusual rate of metal enrichment, with the metallicity level of recent
star formation episodes of about solar and probably higher (like KK 197 and ESO 269–
066). Possible explanation of this high enrichment level can be due to interaction and
merging of some galaxies during the evolution of the Cen A group. Sales et al. (astro-
ph/0706.2009v3, Millennium simulations) have demonstrated high matter spread (up to
2 virial radii) in such evolutionary processes. Smaller members in the group can experi-
ence enhanced star formation due to these interactions and merging using the processed
in larger galaxies matter of higher metal abundance.

Galaxy evolution in the Cen A group
Figure 1. 3D structure of the Cen A group is shown. Size of the spheres corresponds to absolute
magnitude of a galaxy. Grey spheres represent dIrr galaxies and black spheres are dSphs. Three
largest spheres are central body of the group (Cen A elliptical galaxy) and two spiral mem-
bers. Names of the galaxies with SFH measured by us are indicated in the ﬁgure. Well known
morphological segregation between dSph and dIrr galaxies can be recognize in the picture. The
dwarf spheroidals are closer to the central body, whereas the dwarf irregulars mostly situated
in the outer part of the group.
