ABSTRACT
We build a theoretical model to study the origin of the globular cluster metallicity bimodality in the hierar-
chical galaxy assembly scenario The model is based on empirical relations such as the galaxy mass-metallicity
relation OH - Mstar as a function of redshift and on the observed galaxy stellar mass function up to redshift
z  4 We make use of the theoretical merger rates as a function of mass and redshift from the Millennium
simulation to build galaxy merger trees We derive a new galaxy FeH - Mstar relation as a function of red-
shift and by assuming that globular clusters share the metallicity of their original parent galaxy at the time
of their formation we populate the merger tree with globular clusters We perform a series of Monte-Carlo
simulations of the galaxy hierarchical assembly and study the properties of the nal globular cluster popula-
tion as a function of galaxy mass assembly and star formation history and under different assumptions for the
evolution of the galaxy mass-metallicity relation The main results and predictions of the model are the follow-
ing 1 The hierarchical clustering scenario naturally predicts a metallicity bimodality in the galaxy globular
cluster population where the metal-rich subpopulation is composed of globular clusters formed in the galaxy
main progenitor around redshift z  2 and the metal-poor subpopulation is composed of clusters accreted from
satellites and formed at redshifts z  3 - 4 2 The model reproduces the observed relations by Peng et al
2006 for the metallicities of the metal-rich and metal-poor globular cluster subpopulations as a function of
galaxy mass the positions of the metal-poor and metal-rich peaks depend exclusively on the evolution of the
galaxy mass-metallicity relation and the OFe both of which can be constrained by this method In partic-
ular we nd that the galaxy OFe evolves linearly with redshift from a value of  05 at redshift z  4 to
a value of  01 at z  0 3 For a given galaxy mass the relative strenght of the metal-rich and metal-poor
peaks depends exclusively on the galaxy assembly and star formation history where galaxies living in denser
environments andor early types galaxies show a larger fraction of metal-poor clusters while galaxies with a
sparse merger history andor late type galaxies are dominated by metal-rich clusters 4 The globular cluster
metallicity bimodality disappears for galaxy masses around and below Mstar  109 M and for redshifts z  2

1 INTRODUCTION
Globular cluster GC systems in galaxies have become
a useful tool to study the mechanisms of galaxy formation
Thanks to a rise in the level of details in observations now
we can gain insight into the colour metallicity and abun-
dance gradients of such systems for a large number of galax-
ies and build statistically solid scaling relations between GC
and galaxy properties
GCs are for the most part old objects with ages estimated
to be  10 Gyr Brodie et al 2005 Strader et al 2005 Peng
et al 2006 Therefore not only they have survived any vio-
lent event in the assembly of their host galaxy but they also
provide a chemical record of the galaxies where they were
formed Pota et al 2012 Coupled with the fact that they
are very luminous they make for excellent probes of the fos-
sil records of galaxies and shed light on the mechanisms of
galaxy assembly and star formation history
Of particular interest is the metallicity distribution of GCs
in galaxies Galaxies of all morphologies have a GC popula-
tion with an average metallicity that correlates with the galaxy
stellar mass or luminosity as rst shown by Brodie  Huchra
1991 Lotz et al 2004 Peng et al 2006 In addition most
galaxy GC systems exhibit a colour bimodality Zepf  Ash-
man 1993 Ostrov et al 1993 Whitmore et al 1995 Elson 
Santiago 1996 Peng et al 2006 Spitler et al 2006 Strader
et al 2006 Larsen et al 2001 This is driven by a metal-
licity bimodality with bluer GCs being more metal-poor and
redder GCs being more metal-rich while both populations are
old  10 Gyr Forbes et al 2001 1997ab 2011 Peng et al
2006 Strader et al 2005 2006 Ct et al 1998 Puzia et al
2005 Pierce et al2006 Brodie et al 2005 Brodie  Strader
2006 Although there is some debate in the literature see
Yoon et al 2006 this result has been conrmed spectroscop-
ically Brodie et al 2005 2012 Cohen et al 2003 Strader
et al 2005 Alves-Brito et al 2011 Usher et al 2012 The
well-dened metal-rich and metal-poor GC sequences sepa-
rately follow two galaxy stellar mass - GC metallicity rela-
tions FeHGC - Mstar of which the metal-rich one is stronger
and tighter while the metal-poor one is weaker and exhibits a
larger scatter Larsen et al 2001 Strader et al 2006 Peng et
al 2006 Ct et al 1998 There is increasing evidence that
these features of GC systems are universal from giant ellip-
ticals to dwarfs Strader et al 2006 although some galaxies
show an even more complex situation with multiple metal-
licity peaks see for instance Peng et al 2006 Blom et al
Intriguingly the differences between bluemetal-poor and
redmetal-rich GCs also extend to their dynamical properties
as shown in recent observations Pota et al 2012 The two
subpopulations have different spatial distributions inside the
host galaxies the metal-rich GCs are more centrally concen-
Chiara Tonini
trared with a radial distribution prole that follows closely
the spheroidal stellar component of the galaxy while the
metal-poor GCs show a more extended distribution and is
likely physically associated with the stellar halo Bassino et
al 2006 Goudfrooij et al 2007 Peng et al 2008 Forbes
et al 2012 Pota et al 2012 the M87 data of Strader et
al 2011 represent the best example of the close spatial cou-
pling of metal-rich GCs with galaxy starlight and the more
extended distribution of metal-poor GCs Correspondingly
the kinematics of the metal-rich subpopulation follows that
of the main stellar component including rotation Strader et
al 2011 while the metal-poor subpopulation shows larger
velocity dispersion and small or null net rotation
A scenario has been proposed where GCs are formed in
gas-rich major merger events at high redshift z  4 - 5
early mergers of smaller hosts produce metal-poor GCs while
later mergers of more evolved galaxies in high density envi-
ronments produce metal-rich GCs Muratov  Gnedin 2010
Kravtsov  Gnedin 2005 Bekki et al 2007 2008 These
models however encounter a number of problems there is no
clear prediction about any metallicity bimodality or galaxy
mass-GC metallicity relations and the resulting ages of the
metal-rich GCs are too young Muratov  Gnedin 2010 an
ad hoc mechanism is needed to shut off bluemetal-poor GC
formation Bekki et al 2008 Beasley et al 2002 and an
analysis of the observed GC abundance and metallicity gra-
dients is not compatible this kind of formation mechanism
Arnold et al 2011
Alternatively it has been proposed that rather than origi-
nating from two main epochs or modes of GC formation the
GC chemo-dynamical bimodality can stem from the galaxy
assembly history without invoking mergers as the GC for-
mation mechanism In this scenario the metal-rich GC sub-
population is formed together with the bulk of the galaxy
stellar component in an early violent dissipative phase and
during a later slower phase the metal-poor GC subpopulation
is accreted via minor mergers Forbes et al 2011 1997ab
Arnold et al 2011 Masters  Ashman 2010 or via stripping
of GCs from satellites Ct et al 1998 2000 The main
difference with the merger scenario is that GCs of different
metallicities are formed in different galaxies and then brought
together by galaxy assembly rather than being formed in the
same galaxy at different stages of the galaxy evolution In this
work we call this the assembly scenario
11 This work
In this work we want to put the assemby scenario in the
context of the hierarchical structure formation theory and in-
vestigate whether the GC metallicity bimodality indeed orig-
inates from the hierarchical nature of galaxy assembly
other words is the GC metallicity bimodality a natural pre-
diction of hierarchical clustering
To answer this question we build a model to produce the as-
sembly history of galaxies and their GC population in a series
of Monte-Carlo simulations We base our model galaxy prop-
erties on observed scaling relations as a function of redshift
such as the galaxy mass-metallicity relation OH - Mstar re-
lation and the galaxy stellar mass function We assume that
galaxies at z  0 were formed through a combination of local
in-situ star formation and accretion of satellite galaxies in a
series of merger episodes spanning the lifetime of the galaxy
the merger rates are obtained from the Millennium simula-
tion We populate each galaxy in the merger tree with GCs
assuming that they share the metallicity of the main stellar
component of their parent galaxy at the epoch of their forma-
tion When a satellite is accreted so is its GC population
We investigate under what conditions the nal GC popu-
lation shows the metallicity bimodality and follows the ob-
served metal-rich and metal-poor galaxy stellar mass - GC
metallicity relations as well as the observed galaxy mass - GC
number abundance relation Peng et al 2006 2008 Strader
et al 2006
The novelty of this analysis is that it provides constraints
and predictions 1 on the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation as a
function of redshift 2 on the galaxy assembly and star forma-
tion history and 3 on the evolution of the GC bimodality and
ultimately it presents a method to test the hierarchical galaxy
formation
This paper is organised as follows In Sections 2 and 3 we
present the model in Section 2 we describe the galaxy assem-
bly and the globular cluster formation and the Monte Carlo
simulation in Section 3 we present the derivation of the du-
cial galaxy mass-metallicity relation In Section 4 we present
our results for the globular cluster metallicity distribution and
its implications to constrain galaxy formation and in Section
5 we discuss our ndings Section 6 is a summary of our con-
clusions
2 THE MODEL GALAXY ASSEMBLY AND
GLOBULAR CLUSTER FORMATION
Consider a galaxy of stellar mass M0 at redshift z  0 This
object represents the nal stage of a merger tree ie a sys-
tem of independent progenitor galaxies which were accreted
and contributed to all the mass components dark matter gas
stars GCs that now characterise the galaxy At any given
time we identify the main progenitor in the merger tree as
the most massive galaxy that is present in the tree while we
improperly call satellites the rest of the objects For any
given galaxy at z  0 we build a Monte Carlo simulation
with N realisations of the merger tree ie N different assem-
bly histories We performed numerical tests on N in a range
N  10106 nding convergence of our results for N  100
The plots in this work are made with N  103
Galaxies evolve depending on the mass of the host dark
matter halo and on the density of the surrounding environ-
ment In the hierarchical clustering framework smaller ob-
jects virialise earlier see for instance Frenk  White 2012
so they contain older metal-poor stars Their cycle of star for-
mation and feedback is less efcient and supernovae winds
are more effective in expelling metals from the galaxy factors
that contribute to slow down the rise of metallicity in their
stellar populations At the same time in more massive galax-
ies the deeper potential wells render supernovae winds less
effective in expelling metals and the enhanced ability to re-
tain gas allows for sustained star formation and more stellar
generations As a consequence at all redshifts a monothonic
positive mass-metallicity correlation Mstar - FeH is in place
for all galaxies in the merger tree The derivation of this rela-
tion from the observed OH- Mstar relation will be described
in detail in the next Section
We assume the appearance of a globular cluster popula-
tion in a galaxy is an event of a relatively short duration
and in general not associated with the quiescent star forma-
tion phase but indicative of a particularly intense evolution-
ary phase This assumption is sustained by a number of ob-
servations First the observed masses of GCs can reach up
to M  106 M requiring very intense bursts of star forma-
Globular cluster bimodality and galaxy assembly
tion Secondly GCs which in general are well described by
single stellar populations SSP ie coheval ensembles of stars
that share the same metallicity are for the most part old ob-
jects with ages  10 Gyr as referenced in the Introduction
Fittingly the observed GC ages put the epoch of their appear-
ance squarely at the peak of the cosmic star formation history
determined to be at redshifts z  2 - 4 Hopkins  Beacom
2006 Bouwens et al 2009 Third the mean metallicity of
the GC population is observed to be higher in more massive
galaxies with a Mstar -
FeHGC parallel to that of the galaxy
mass-metallicity relation see for instance Larsen et al 2001
Peng et al 2006 Ct et al 1998 in support of the idea
that the GC population is closely related to the main stellar
component and is similarly affected by halo mass and envi-
ronment ie more massive galaxies form their bulk of their
stars later from more enriched gas
We assume that the old globular cluster population ages
 10 Gyr were formed in galaxies at the peak of their star
formation activity likely L galaxies at all redshifts z  2
Note that following this assumption the older globular clus-
ters formed at higher redshifts in smaller systems and with a
lower metallicity This is in accord with observations that es-
timate metal-poor GCs to be about 1- 2 Gyr older than metal-
rich GCs Dotter et al 2011 Puzia et al 2005 Woodley
et al 2010 although the precision of the age measurement
for extragalactic GCs is too low to condently discriminate
ages differences at this level Strader et al 2005 We assume
as likely candidates for the formation sites of GCs either the
massive star-forming clumps observed in high redshift z  2
galaxies Shapiro et al 2010 or the central regions of galax-
ies subject to episodes of violent dissipative collapse In both
cases the clumpiness and turbulence of the gas plays a funda-
mental role in boosting the star formation and producing GCs
along with the galaxy main stellar component Shapiro et al
The frequency of globular clusters TN is dened as the num-
ber of GCs per unit galaxy mass of 109 M and at z  0 it
is constrained by observations Peng et al 2008 see also
Spitler et al 2008 Rhode et al 2007 Rhode 2012 In the
galaxies in the merger tree TN depends on the interplay of
different factors like the mean gas density which depends
on the depth of the galactic potential well the metallicity
the feedback regime and the competing regular star for-
mation that feeds the main stellar component
In lack of
other observational constraints we assume that the redshift
z  0 observed relation TN - Mstar holds at all redshifts
so that the total number of local GCs that each galaxy pro-
duces is NGC  TNMstar  Mstar In addition galaxies below
Mstar  109M  Mmin do not form globular clusters consis-
tently with the observed TN - Mstar relation Peng et al 2008
which yields NGC  10 for Mstar  109M see also Muratov
 Gnedin 2010 We also assume that once formed the lo-
cal GCs stabilise themselves in dynamical equilibrium with
the galaxy and therefore remain kinematically coupled with
the main stellar component
We follow the evolution of the merger tree from redshift
zin when the galaxy main progenitor forms its local globular
clusters We assume the epoch is zin  2 The main progeni-
tor is likely to have a rich gas component and is near the peak
of its star formation history it has a stellar mass M1 and a
mean total metallicity Z1 which follows the galaxy mass -
metallicity relation Mstar -
FeH at z  zin In each Monte-
Carlo realisation we assume that the metallicity of the locally
formed GCs is peaked aroung Z1 with a gaussian distribu-
tion with   02 consistent with Ct et al 1998 Bekki et
al 2008 which takes into account a non-instantaneous mix-
ing of the metals and the fact that the GC formation covers a
short but nite time-span in which the mean galaxy metallic-
ity can vary The number of local GCs in the main progenitor
is NGC  TNM1  M1
The main progenitor is the most massive galaxy in the
merger tree and is the last one to have its globular cluster
population in place At this point in time the satellites in
the merger tree which by denition have masses Mi  M1
have already formed their own GCs and we put such epoch
of formation around z  3 - 4 see also Shapiro et al 2010
Each satellite metallicity follows the galaxy Mstar -
FeH at
that epoch and in each satellite of mass Mi the GC metallic-
ity is peaked around the current galaxy mean metallicity Zi
while the number of GCs is NGCi  TNMi  Mi We assume
a gaussian distribution of the GC metallicities in each satel-
lite peaked around Zi with   03 which takes into account
the combined effect of the scatter in the GC metallicity in each
satellite  02 plus an additional uncertainty  02 due to
the scatter in the star formation histories of satellites sensi-
tive to environment for instance which affect the satellites
metallicity and the exact epoch of GC formation
The main progenitor M1 evolves into the z  0 galaxy M0
through two main channels by accreting stellar mass in the
form of satellites and by forming stars locally If we dene
as MSF the mass in stars that are formed inside the main pro-
genitor at any time after the GC formation including merger-
triggered star formation then the stellar mass accreted from
satellites is Msat  M0 - M1 - MSF Msat is the sum of the stellar
mass present in all satellites at redshift zin under the assump-
tion that the satellite TN remains constant ie satellites do not
have a prolongued star formation history aftet the GC forma-
tion The ratios M1M0 and MSFM0 are free parameters in
the model and they constrain the assembly and star-formation
history
For each galaxy characterised by M0M1MSFM1 we
run a Monte-Carlo simulation of N realisations of the galaxy
merger history from zin to z  0
In each run we ran-
domise the metallicity distribution of the main progenitors
GCs around Z1 We build the merger tree based on the
observed stellar mass function SMF of Marchesini et al
2009 and the theoretical merger rates obtained from the
Millennium simulation Springel et al 2005 Fakhouri et al
2010 In each realisation we randomise both the mass of
the accreted satellites and the redshift of accretion after sam-
pling a random redshift in the interval z  4 - 0 we interpo-
late the observed stellar mass function to that redshift and we
sample a random satellite mass from it with an acceptance-
rejection algorithm This provides us with a series of merger
candidates each of them is weighted with the mean merger
rate which represents the probability for a merger to happen

From Fig 1 in Fakhouri et al 2010 it is evident that the
merger rate increases with increasing redshift and decreasing
halo mass and hugely favours small ratios   1 between
the satellites and the main progenitors masses
At each timestep in our merger history we add the weighted
mass of each satellite to the stellar mass of the main progen-
itor M which grows in time and we continue until the total
accreted mass is equal to Msat Each merged satellite carries
a population of NGCi  TNMi  Mi globular clusters with
metallicity centered around Zi and randomised in each run
This completes one realisation in the Monte Carlo simulation
and represent one of the N merger histories that we build for
each galaxy For each merger history we obtain a total GC
metallicity distribution that is given by the superposition of
the contributions from the main progenitor and all the satel-
lites After N realisations we produce a mean of the total GC
metallicity distribution
In addition we also explore a scenario where new globular
clusters can be created in gas-rich merger events In this case
we consider that at a redshift znew a merger event is charac-
terised by a gas mass Mgas that is turned into stars and globu-
lar clusters producing Nnew new globular clusters of random
metallicity peaked around Znew the metallicity of the gas
with a gaussian distribution with   02
For a given nal galaxy mass the model uses 2 free pa-
rameters The ratio M1M0 between the mass of the main
progenitor at the epoch when it forms its local GCs and the
nal stellar mass of the galaxy is the assembly parameter the
ratio MSFM0 between the mass of the stars formed locally in
the evolving main progenitor after the GC formation and the
nal stellar mass of the galaxy is the star formation history
parameter
3 THE MODEL EVOLUTION OF THE GALAXY
MASS-METALLICITY RELATION AND GLOBULAR
CLUSTER METALLICITY
The main source of systematic uncertainty in the model
comes from the redshift evolution of the galaxy mass-
metallicity relation Mstar -
FeH Although this is in prin-
ciple constrained by observations we feel that there currently
is a lack of consensus on the evolution of Mstar -
FeH at
the level of precision required for this investigation For this
reason to assign a metallicity to the galaxies in the merger
tree and their globular cluster systems we build a ducial
Mstar -
FeH relation as a function of redshift and we ex-
plore the consequences of varying this relation on the model
As a sanity check to obtain the metallicity of the satellite GCs
we also make use of the total Mstar- FeHGC relation of Peng
et al 2006
The GC metallicity as a function of galaxy mass is provided
in terms of FeH which is a proxy for the total metallicity
Fig 14 of Peng et al 2006 Shapiro et al 2010 The galaxy
metallicity on the other hand is often measured in terms of
the quantity 12 logOH in particular we consider the rela-
tions provided by Maiolino et al 2008 up to z  35 for the
AMAZE Assessing the Mass-Abundance redshift-Z Evolu-
tion program In the lower redshift bin this relation is con-
sistent with the one provided by Tremonti et al 2004 for a
sample of 53000 galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
The Maiolino relations can be parameterised as follows

ters are M0  11181157123812761287 and k0 
90490489987989 Maiolino et al 2008 To ob-
tain a FeH estimate from the quantity logOH we need
to establish the 12  logOH solar value and the OFe or
alternatively Fe values as a function of galaxy mass and
redshift These quantities are degenerate in producing the -
nal FeH
The solar oxygen abundancy is determined to be 12 
logOH  866 Erb et al 2006 but other works put it
at 12  logOH  89 as discussed for instance in Liu et
al 2008 unfortunately the spread in the adopted value of
the solar oxygen abundancy signicantly increases the uncer-
tainty in the calculation of the galaxy Mstar -
FeH relation
In lack of direct spectroscopic observations the determina-
tion of OFe as a function of OH of galaxy mass and
of redshift depends on models of both stellar and galaxy evo-
lution and there is currently no consensus on the conversion
OH into FeH A Pipino et al in preparation and private
communication A determination of Fe as a function of
galaxy mass at z  0 is provided by Thomas et al 2005 for
a sample of 124 early-type galaxies The scatter is substantial
and the mass range does not include galaxies below 1010M
The relation is parameterised as follows
Fe  - 0459  0062 logMstar
If we use this prescription to convert the z  0 Maiolino and
Tremonti relations as FeH  OH -
Fe we obtain
Mstar -
FeH relations that are consistent inside the scatter
with the one provided by Thomas et al 2005 in the range
Mstar  1010 - 1012M provided that FeH and OFe are
reasonable proxies for ZH and Fe respectively The
comparison yields values Fe  01 for Mstar  1010M
and Fe  018 for Mstar  1011M
We use the Maiolino et al 2008 relations to obtain the
FeH - Mstar relations at higher redshifts but we need to
Globular cluster bimodality and galaxy assembly
make an assumption about the redshift dependence of Fe
Such dependence is very uncertain and not all factors respon-
sible for the variation of Fe are currently understood for
instance a progressively top-heavy IMF at higher redshift
would cause an excess of oxygen that would speed up the
Fe evolution For this reason we choose to calibrate our
Fe vs redshift relation empirically Shapiro et al 2010
use an estimated Fe  03 to obtain a relation at redshift
z  2 from data of 12  logOH from Erb et al 2006 A
comparison with the z  2 relation we obtain from Maiolino
et al 2008 via the Thomas et al 2005 prescription shows
us that we need to assume that Fe evolves by 02 dex
in order for the two relations to match We then extrapo-
late this evolution linearly with redshift and obtain values
Fe  01020305 for redshifts z  01235
We provide a rough estimate of the error in the FeH -
Mstar relations from the scatter in the Mstar - 12logOH re-
lation  02 dex Tremonti et al 2004 the scatter in Fe
at redshift 0  01 dex Thomas et al 2005 and the uncer-
tainty in the solar value of 12  logOH  02 dex we ob-
tain an uncertainty   03 dex on FeH for any given stellar
mass Note that this estimate does not take into account the er-
rors in the galaxy mass estimates nor the error increase in the
metallicity measurements at higher redshifts and nonetheless
  03 is of the same order of the systematic errors induced
by our choice of the Fe evolution We will explore the
consequences of varying these relations in the next Section
In Fig 1 we plot our ducial galaxy FeH - Mstar re-
lations up to redshift z  35 On the same Figure we plot
the observed relations between the galaxy stellar mass and
the GC metallicity FeHGC - Mstar obtained by Peng et al
2006 their Fig 14 These are shown as the straigh lines
black for the average GC metallicity in each galaxy red for
the metal-rich GCs and blue for the metal-poor GCs
Once we have the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation in place as
a function of redshift we use it to assign a metallicity to all
the globular clusters in the merger tree the GCs formed in a
galaxy of mass Mstar at a redshift z have a mean metallicity
corresponding to the galaxy FeH at that redshift according
to the derived relations In addition in each galaxy the GC
metallicity is assumed to have a gaussian distribution around
the mean value with   03 dex
4 RESULTS
Fig 2 shows the globular cluster metallicity distribution
in a galaxy of mass M0  1011 M at redshift z  0 with pa-
rameters M1M0  03 and MSFM0  0 ie 70 of the nal
stellar mass come from accreted satellites and there is no ad-
ditional star formation in the main progenitor after the GC
formation averaged over N  1000 Monte Carlo realisations
of the galaxy formation history The thick black line shows
the total distribution while the red line shows the distribution
for the clusters that were formed locally in the main progeni-
tor at z  zin  2 and the blue line shows the distrubution for
the clusters formed in satellites at an epoch z  3 - 4 and that
merged with the main progenitor The dashed lines  shaded
areas show the values of the metal-rich and metal-poor GC
metallicity FeH and their 1 uncertainties for a galaxy of
mass M0 from the Peng et al 2006 relations
The model galaxy shows a sharp bimodality in the globu-
lar cluster metallicity distribution The metal-rich peak of
the metallicity distibution is entirely dominated by local GCs
formed in the main progenitor at z  2 The metal-poor peak
is entirely dominated by satellite GCs accreted via the hierar-
chical assembly The positions of both peaks are consistent
with the observed galaxy stellar mass - GC metallicity re-
lations by Peng et al 2006 for metal-rich and metal-poor
globular clusters
The number of GCs in various realisations of this galaxy
scatters around the value TN  6 interpolated from Peng et
al 2008 for a galaxy of mass Mstar  1011M staying in
the rather large 5 observed scatter limits For a given set
of history parameters M1M0 and MSFM0 the nal value
of TN depends mainly on the assumption about the minimum
stellar mass of a galaxy that can form globular clusters here
Mlimit  109M Note that a variation of a factor 10 in the
mass limit such that Mlimit  108M yields a value TN  50
one order of magnitude off the Peng et al 2008 relation
The positions of the peaks in the GC metallicity distribution
are determined by the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation given
that we can constrain the ages of the GCs from observations
and under the assumption that the GC metallicity is connected
to the instantaneous metallicity of the galaxy where they were
formed But is the bimodality just a result of these choices
or is it an intrinsic feature of our mass assembly scenario
Fig 3 shows the GC metallicity distribution of a galaxy
characterised by M0  1011 M M1M0  05 MSF  0  this
time under a very conservative assumption the GC metallic-
ity in all the objects in the merger tree main progenitor and
satellites is just taken from the average FeHGC - Mstar re-
lation of Peng et al 2006 thick black line in Fig1
Although both the local and the accreted GCs obey the
same average relation they are still separated in metallicity
the distribution of which shows two distinct peaks albeit at
the wrong values The reason why the metallicity bimodal-
ity is still present is that the hierarchical mass assembly is
governed by the halo merger rate which greatly suppresses
merger events of high mass ratios larger than 1  10 as ev-
ident in Fakhouri et al 2010 so that it is highly improb-
able that a galaxy merges with objects of similar mass and
therefore similar metallicity This feature alone is what drives
the bimodality in the GC metallicity distribution Therefore
a metallicity bimodality in the GC population is a direct
prediction of the hierarchical clustering scenario
Notice also that the metal-poor peak in Fig 3 is almost at
the right value of FeH while the metal-rich peak is off by
 05 dex towards the metal-poor side The slope of the aver-
age FeHGC - Mstar relation in Fig1 suggests that the num-
ber of metal-poor GCs is highly dominant in low-mass galax-
ies This happens because these are intrinsically metal-poor
galaxies in addition note that as their stellar mass is small
in their assembly history they are only able to accrete smaller
objects that are devoid of globular clusters given the exis-
tence of Mlimit therefore their GC population is not bimodal
and their average metallicity peaks exactly where the metal-
poor peak is located On the other hand the more massive
a galaxy is the richest its assembly history is with a merger
tree with enough mass range to sustain a varied secondary GC
population so its GC population is more likely to be bimodal
Therefore a massive galaxy always has a secondary metal-
poor GC population and the average GC metallicity deviates
from both peaks This point is addressed in the next Figure

this mass range As expected the more massive a galaxy is
the richest is its GC population in both the metal-rich and the
metal-poor component However notice that although the
history parameters are the same in all cases the relative con-
Globular cluster bimodality and galaxy assembly
tribution of the two peaks varies with the metal-poor peak be-
coming less and less signicant relative to the metal-rich peak
for lower-mass galaxies in accord with Peng et al
and Shapiro et al 2010 In the lowest mass bin the rela-
tive height of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks is reversed
given that the mass limit for GC formation is 109 M this
galaxy is for the most part accreting satellites that dont con-
tribute to the GC population with the rare exception of major
mergers in this case Msat  109 M If we assume that the
globular cluster formation is hampered in low-mass galaxies
ie that galaxies below a mass threshold cannot produce glob-
ular clusters then the model predicts that the GC metallicity
bimodality ceases to exist slightly above that mass threshold
In such galaxies the GC population is unimodal and entirely
composed of locally-formed GCs On the other hand the
overall GC metallicity decreases following the galaxy mass
and as a result the GC population in low mass galaxies is
metal-poor again in accord with Peng et al 2008
The galaxy assembly history determines the fraction of the
nal mass that is accreted from the merger tree and there-
fore the fraction of globular clusters that are formed outside
the main progenitor and which we have shown to compose
the metal-poor peak Fig 5 shows the relative height of the
metal-rich and metal-poor peaks generated in different assem-
bly histories parameterised as M1M0 For a galaxy of nal
stellar mass M0  1011 M the panels from left to right show
the GC metallicity distribution for M1M0  02030506
respectively In all cases MSF  0 As expected a galaxy with
a poor merger history such as the case M1M0  06 for in-
stance shows a GC metallicity distribution dominated by the
local metal-rich population The model therefore predicts that
the presence of a very strong metal-rich GC component is a
sign of a sparse merger history For a given galaxy mass the
richness of the merger tree depends on enviromnent hence
the model predicts that galaxies in low-density environments
have for a given mass a GC population that is more metal-
rich dominated than galaxies of the same mass living in the
centre of clusters
So far we have analysed the simplied case of galaxies with
MSF  0 However for the majority of galaxies the star forma-
tion does not stop at z  2 and a signicant part of the nal
stellar mass is formed at later times In this case a signi-
cant fraction of the galaxy stellar mass is not associated with
formation or accretion of globular clusters To account for
this stellar component we vary the value of the star formation
history parameter MSFM0 Fig 6 shows the GC metallicity
distribution for a galaxy of nal mass M0  1011 M where
the stellar mass is contributed by 1 the main progenitor at
the epoch of GC formation in proportion of M1M0  03 the
local GC population is associated with this component 2

mation in quantity MSFM0  02030506 panels from
left to right and 3 stars accreted from satellites in quantity
M0 - M1 - MSF  Msat Note that a higher value of MSFM0
implies a smaller value of Msat ie a poorer merger history
Fig 6 shows that as the galaxy growth becomes more
dominated by local star formation and the contribution of the
mass accreted by satellites is smaller the GC population be-
comes more and more dominated by local globular clusters
even if most of the stellar component is not directly associ-
ated with the globular clusters themselves The model pre-
dicts that in galaxies with an active star formation history
after the GC formation ie at z  2 the relative strenght
of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks of the GC metallicity
distribution is biased towards the metal-rich GCs for a given
galaxy mass If we consider the star formation history as as-
sociated with morphology then the model predicts that for
a given galaxy mass M0 and total number of GCs late-type
galaxies have a GC metallicity distribution with a stronger
metal-rich peak than early-type galaxies
Note that the results in Figs 5 6 show that given the
nal mass of the galaxy M0 the nal number of globular
clusters in the galaxy depends on the value of the assembly
history parameter M1M0 and the star formation history pa-
rameter MSFM0 The large scatter in the value of the GC
frequency per unit mass TN for a given galaxy mass seen in
Peng et al 2008 is likely to be due to the variety of his-
tories for galaxies in each mass bin The nal value of TN
decreases for a decreasing value of Msat Note that the as-
sembly and star formation history parameters have instead no
effect on the position of the peaks which are entirely deter-
mined by the evolution of the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation
The number of GCs together with the relative abundance of
the metal-rich and metal-poor components can therefore be
used to constrain the assembly and star formation history of
the galaxy
As discussed in the Introduction the scenario in which
globular cluster are generally formed in gas-rich mergers can-
not reproduce the properties and the scaling relations of the
GC population However if globular clusters indeed form
during violent bursts of star formation it is physically possi-
ble that some of them indeed are formed in mergers at all red-
shifts a fact that would explain the presence of intermediate-
age or young GCs in some galaxies Kissler-Patig et al 1998

al 2010 Brodie  Strader 2006 and references therein
Fig 7 shows the effect of a gas-rich merger event where
new GCs are formed on the GC metallicity distribution In
this example in the same galaxy portrayed in Fig 2 we
introduce a gas-rich merger event that triggers the formation
new GCs in quantity  30 of the local GC population of
the main progenitor with intermediate metallicities peaked
around FeH  - 08 with a gaussian of width   02 dex
green line This plot shows that the creation of new GCs
in merger events introduces a stochastic variation of the GC
metallicity distribution that leads to the formation of ter-
tiary peaks in positions determined by the metallicity of the
gas perturbedcarried by the merger The number of newly-
formed GCs depends on the available gas mass and the star
formation rate in the merger-triggered bursts as well as the
efciency of GC formation vs star formation
It is clear from this plot that if we consider the formation of
GC in gas-rich merger events the GC metallicity distribution
becomes more complex The stochasticity of such events al-
lows for any shape of the nal metallicity distribution a pro-
longued history of gas-rich mergers contributes to the dilution
of the bimodality Such mechanism can explain the number of
exotic GC metallicities distributions found by a number of
authors including Blom et al 2012 and Peng et al 2006
with a number of galaxies that either show one or more ter-
tiary peaks or a non-bimodal GC metallicity distribution it
should be noted that such a scenario needs to be conrmed
with dynamical analysis for instance Blom et al 2012 show
data of a galaxy with an intermediate-metallicity GC subpop-
ulation that rotates with the main body of the galaxy Note
that major gas-rich mergers are good candidates to provide
very intense bursts of star formation during which new globu-

lar clusters can be formed If a galaxy undergoes an assembly
history devoid of any gas-rich mergers it is hard to envisage
another mechanism that is able to provide a strong enough
perturbation of the gas in the galaxy to trigger very intense
bursts of star formation as per Shapiro et al 2010 which
can create a tertiary GC population Therefore we can con-
sider tertiary peaks in the GC metallicity distribution as clear
signatures of major gas-rich merger events in the past history
of the galaxy
The total number of GCs and the relative height of the
metal-rich and metal-poor peaks depend on the galaxy mass
and the galaxy assembly and star formation history while
the positions of the peaks depend on the determination of the
galaxy mass-metallicity relation as a function of redshift To
explore this point further we study the GC metallicity distri-
bution resulting from the FeH - Mstar relation obtained in
Section 3 under different prescriptions In particular we de-
scribe two examples of variations of the recipes described in
Section 3 that affect 1 the normalisation and 2 the evolution
of the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation 1 is a variation of the
value for the solar 12  logOH and 2 is a variation of the
prescription for the evolution of the galaxy Fe value

distribution shows a somewhat diminished bimodality and the

Both peaks are centered around too high metallicities and the
problem is worse for the metal-poor peak if we assume that
the galaxy OFe does not evolve with redshift but mantains
the local value then we are overestimating the galaxy metal
content by a factor that is proportional with redshift and the
globular clusters formed in small galaxies at high redshifts are
the ones that are affected the most
The lower left panel of Fig 8 portrays the galaxy FeH-
Mstar relations as obtained in Section 3 with the same evolu-
tion of OFe used so far in this work but with a different
solar oxygen value 12  logOH  89 Liu et al 2008 In
this case the evolution of the FeH- Mstar relation is not af-
fected but its normalisation has changed The resulting GC
metallicity distribution does not change in shape the relative
height and position of the peaks is the same but both peaks
are shifted towards lower FeH values because the oxygen
content OH yields a lower total FeH content
The model predicts that the positions of the metal-rich and
metal-poor peaks of the GC metallicity distribution are exclu-
sively dependent on the galaxy mass-metallicity relation as a
function of redshift In the case where globular clusters are in-
deed fossil records of the metallicity of their parent galaxy at
the time when they formed then through this model the GC
metallicity distribution and in particular the position of the
metal-rich and metal-poor peaks can be used to constraint the
evolution of the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation and the evolu-
tion of the galaxy OFe
5 DISCUSSION
The results described in the previous Section show that the
hierarchical galaxy assembly directly predicts a metallicity bi-
modality of the globular cluster populations in galaxies Pre-
Chiara Tonini
vious studies like Shapiro et al 2010 on the contrary argued
that the hierarchical mass assembly would blur the correla-
tions between galaxies and their GCs The model presented
here predicts globular clusters to have a bimodal metallicity
distribution with the metal-rich and the metal-poor peaks fol-
lowing the FeHGC - Mstar relations described in Peng et al
2006 and determined by the evolution of the galaxy mass-
metallicity relation The model also predicts that the relative
strenght of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks depends on
the assembly and star formation history of the galaxy More-
over the model predicts that the metallicity bimodality dis-
appears for masses below Mstar  109M and for redshifts
The main mechanism at work in producing the GC bi-
modality is the existence of the galaxy mass-metallicity rela-
tion coupled with the natural behaviour of hierarchical mass
assembly to strongly favour minor mergers over major merg-
ers In this scenario all globular clusters form with the same
mechanism and share the metallicity of their parent galaxy
the hierarchical build-up of galaxies then assembles the GC
populations so that the GCs of a satellite become part of
the accreted metal-poor GC component of a bigger galaxy
of higher metallicity in a generalisation of the scenario of
Shapiro et al 2010 Note that this mechanism still works
in the case of satellites with bimodal GC distributions both
the metal-rich and the metal-poor subpopulations of a satel-
lite are metal-poor compared to the central galaxy and will
contribute to its nal metal-poor GC population
Under the assumption that GC formation is a rapid process
closely linked to the properties of the galaxy at the time of the
event the fact that GCs of different metallicities form in dif-
ferent galaxies at slightly different times is enough for the hi-
erarchical galaxy formation scenario to naturally produce the
correct GC metallicity distribution The observational facts
imply this very clearly For instance a comparison of the
metal-poor globular cluster FeHGC - Mstar relation with the
galaxy mass-metallicity relation blue straight line in Fig 1
shows that for any given galaxy mass above Mstar  109 M
the galaxy is always more metal-rich that its own metal-poor
globular clusters unless they were formed at z  4 This im-
plies that these globular clusters must have formed in smaller
galaxies and they were then accreted Note that the alternative
scenario of a multi-phase GC formation in each single galaxy
like for instance Beasley et al 2002 where metal-poor GCs
are formed rst and metal-rich GCs are formed later in merg-
ers necessarily implies some form of systematic segregations
of metals and an ad hoc shut-down of the formation of the
metal-poor component in order to produce both the correct
metallicity and the bimodality In fact if a galaxy experiences
a prolongued phase of local GC formation the bimodality is
destroyed by the galaxy chemical self-enrichment
The results presented in this work are based on theoreti-
cal merger trees extracted from the Millennium simulation
Among the cosmological parameters the value of 8 can af-
fect these results in the sense that a lower clustering power
would produce a delayed mass accretion and sparser merger
histories While the bimodality would remain unchanged the
height of the metal-poor peak would be affected However
the magnitude of the effect would be smaller than the scatter
in the observed values of TN and the scatter between differ-
ent Monte Carlo runs and the results presented in this work
would remain unaffected In any case this would be an inter-
esting avenue of investigation
The bimodality in the GC metallicity distribution is solid
against variations of our initial conditions such as any as-
sumption about the metallicity we assume for the galaxy or
the GC themselves Figs 2 3 8 Thorugh hierarchical
galaxy assembly it is rather hard to produce a GC metallicity
distribution that is not bimodal Nonetheless the position of
the peaks is not recovered correctly if we assume that the local
and accreted GC populations form at the same time given the
galaxy mass-metallicity relations described in this work This
is in accord with observations that determine the metal-poor
GCs to be 1 - 2 Gyr older than the metal-rich GCs A second-
order sophistication of this model would be to introduce an
analytic relation between the galaxy mass and the epoch GC
formation but in reality this epoch is likely to vary with envi-
ronment and the uctuations of the local star formation rate
A scatter in the epoch of formation would mirror a scatter in
the galaxy metallicity via the evolution of the galaxy mass-
metallicity relation this effect has been mimicked in this work
by the introduction of a scatter in the GC metallicity of the
satellites
In this model old globular clusters are considered fossil
records of the galaxy where they were formed and their -
nally metallicity distribution is exclusively a result of the hi-
erarchical galaxy assembly The factors that affect the nal
metallicity distributions are 1 the evolution of the galaxy
mass-metallicity relation which completely determines the
position of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks and 2 the
merger history therefore the environmental density and the
star formation history which completely determine the rela-
tive strenghts of the metal-poor and metal-rich peaks These
constraints are independent and orthogonal with no degener-
acy between them
Provided we know the GC ages we can use this model to
test and constrain the evolution of the galaxy FeH - Mstar
relation and the evolution of Fe through the positions
of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks
In order to repro-
2006 FeHGC - Mstar relations the
duce the Peng et al
model favours a value of Fe  05 at redshift z  4 and
a linear evolution down to Fe  01 at z  0 a solar
value 12  logOH  866 and the evolution of the galaxy
FeH - Mstar relation plotted in Fig 1 Note however that
even if we can rely on spectroscopy for the determination of
the globular cluster metallicity with good precision there are
still signicant uncertainties on the GC age determination In
this work we have used the observed estimates for the aver-
age GC ages but if we consider their uncertainties combined
with the current size of the uncertaintiy on the galaxy mass-
metallicity relation then there is a substantial degeneracy be-
tween redshift and galaxy metallicity in the determination of
the positions of the metal-rich and metal-poor peaks an issue
that will be solved with higher precision observations from
the next-generation instruments and surveys
Unrelated to the particular values of the metal-rich and
metal-poor peaks the model predicts the relative height of the
peaks to give an insight into the assembly and star formation
history of the galaxy for a given galaxy mass a dominant
metal-rich peak indicates a quiet merger history andor a sig-
nicant growth of the galaxy through local star formation as
opposed to a mass growth driven by accretion of satellites
Therefore the relative abundance of metal-poor and metal-
rich GCs is correlated with environmental density and mor-
phology with isolated late-type galaxies of given mass M0
being more metal-rich GC dominated than early types of the
same mass living in dense environments The current state of
Globular cluster bimodality and galaxy assembly
observations of GC populations in late-type galaxies does not
yet provide denitive constraints but this is certainly an area
where more numerous and improved observations are called
for This is of particular interest when attempting to con-
strain the galaxy star formation history in that this method
is complementary to the SED-tting technique which is af-
fected by a number of systematic uncertainties Tonini et al
2009 2010 2011 2012 Henriques et al 2011 Maraston et
al 2010 Pforr et al 2012
The hierarchical galaxy mass assembly naturally leads to
bimodality in the globular cluster metallicity distribution A
bimodal distribution is sign of a two-phase galaxy formation
with an intense dissipative phase that leads to the formation of
the core of the galaxy and the local GCs and a second phase
of accretion of satellites and the acquisition of a secondary GC
population This regularity breaks down at very small masses
when galaxies are not massive enough to accrete GCs from
their merger tree their satellites are in fact so small that they
cannot form their own GCs In this case the GC distribution
is unimodal On the other hand the smaller a galaxy is the
least probable it is that it actually has an extended merger tree
so even when the few satellites contribute with globular clus-
ters the metal-poor peak is subdominant or negligible Note
that this behaviour is not in disagreement with the TN - Mstar
relation presented in Peng et al 2008 For masses below
109 M even 1 globular cluster will yield a value TN  10
This shows that our limit mass for the production of globular
clusters Mlimit  109 is a realistic prediction
In relation to the number of globular clusters per galaxy
mass TN predicted by the model the values we obtain are in
the range of the scatter observed by Peng et al 2008 We
argue that in observations such scatter arises from the variety
of assembly and star formation histories that generated the
galaxies in the sample In the model the scatter between dif-
ferent Monte Carlo runs is of the same order of magnitude
and we argue that such a scatter generates from the scatter
in the mass function of the merger tree incorporating all the
possible assembly paths to build up the nal galaxy mass
The nal value of TN depends on the assembly and history
parameters M1M0 and MSFM0 where richer merger histo-
ries strenghten the metal-poor peak and raise the total number
of globular clusters
The model also predicts that the GC bimodality is a function
of redshift The more time a galaxy has to accrete satellites
after the GC formation the more rich its secondary population
will be Therefore we expect the GC metallicity bimodality
to disappear by redshift z  2 and above
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We have performed a series of Monte-Carlo simulations of
the assembly history of galaxies and studied the metallicity
distribution of their globular cluster systems To do so we
built a model for the assembly of the globular cluster popula-
tion following the hierarchical galaxy assembly based on em-
pirical scaling relations such as the galaxy mass-metallicity
relation OH- Mstar and on the observed galaxy stellar mass
function up to redshift z  4 We also made use of the theoret-
ical merger rates as a function of mass and redshift from the
Millennium simulation to build merger trees for a set of nal
galaxies
By determining the galaxy FeH - Mstar relation for all
galaxies in each merger tree and by assuming that globular
clusters share the metallicity of their original parent galaxy
at the time of their formation we populated the merger tree
with globular clusters The hierarchical assembly of the nal
galaxy creates a globular cluster population composed by the
local GCs formed in the main progenitor and those accreted
from the merger tree We conclude that
 the nal globular cluster metallicity distribution is in gen-
eral bimodal the GC metallicity bimodality is a direct predic-
tion of the hierarchical clustering scenario
 the metal-rich peak of the GC metallicity distribution is
composed of globular clusters locally formed in the main pro-
genitor while the metal-poor peak is composed of globular
clusters accreted from the satellites that compose the merger
tree At all times GCs in satellites are more metal-poor than
GCs formed in the main progenitor due to the existence of the
galaxy mass-metallicity relation both the metal-rich and the
metal-poor subpopulations of a satellite will contribute to the
metal-poor GC population of the main galaxy
 the positions of the metal-rich and metal-poor peak
depend exclusively on the evolution of the galaxy mass-
metallicity relation FeH - Mstar we are able to constrain
such evolution and predict that the galaxy OFe evolves lin-
early with redshift from a value of  05 at redshift z  4 to a
value of  01 at z  0
 the relative strenght of the metal-rich and metal-poor peak
depends on the assembly and star formation history of the
galaxy The model predicts that for a given galaxy mass
galaxies with a poor merger history such as galaxies form-
ing in low density environments andor galaxies with a pro-
longued star formation history after the epoch of GC forma-
tion that contributes most of the galaxy mass such as late-
type galaxies will have a globular cluster population domi-
nated by the metal-rich component On the other hand galax-
ies of the same mass but with an intense merger history such
as early-type galaxies andor galaxies living in dense environ-
ments will have a globular cluster population with a larger
metal-poor component
 the model predicts that the globular cluster metallicity bi-
modality disappears at galaxy masses around 109 M more-
over the model predicts that the bimodality is progressively
less pronounced at higher redshift and disappears around red-
shift z  2
