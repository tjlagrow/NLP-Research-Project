Abstract Deep surveys conducted during the past decades have shown that galaxies in the
distant universe are generally of more irregular shapes and are disky in appearance and in their
star formation rate compared to galaxies in similar environments in the nearby universe Given
that the merger rate between z2 and the local universe is far from adequate to account for
this observed morphological transformation rate an internal mechanism for the morphological
transformation of galaxies is to be sought whose operation can be further aided by environ-
mental factors The secular evolution mechanism especially with the discovery of a collisionless
dissipation mechanism for stars within the secular evolution paradigm has provided just such
a framework for understanding the morphological evolution of galaxies across the Hubble time
In this paper we will summarize the past theoretical results on the dynamical mechanisms for
secular evolution and highlight new results in the analysis of the observational data which
conrmed that density waves in physical galaxies possess the kind of characteristics which could
produce theobserved rates of morphological transformation for both cluster and eld galaxies

1 Introduction
It has been a commonly-held belief that the stellar orbit in a galaxy containing quasi-
stationary density wave patterns does not exhibit secular decay or increase and there is
no wave and disk-star interaction except at the wave-particle resonances Lynden-Bell 
Kalnajs 1972 Zhang 1996 1998 1999 rst demonstrated that secular orbital changes
of stars across the entire galaxy disk are in fact possible due to a collective instability
induced by the density wave patterns The integral manifestation of this process is an
azimuthal phase shift between the potential and density spirals which results in a secular
torque action between the wave pattern and the underlying disk matter As a result the
matter inside the corotation radius loses angular momentum to the wave secularly and
sinks inward The wave carries the angular momentum it receives from the inner disk
matter to the outer disk and deposits it there causing the matter in the outer disk to
drift further out
The secular morphological evolution process causes the Hubble type of an average
galaxy to evolve from late to early Zhang 1999 The rate of secular evolution is expected
to be faster for cluster galaxies than for isolated eld galaxies because it is proportional
to the wave amplitude squared and pattern pitch-angle squared Zhang 1998 and clus-
ter galaxies are found to have large amplitude and open density wave patterns excited
through the tidal interactions with neighboring galaxies and with the cluster potential
as a whole

2 New Results on the Secular Mass Accretion Rates
We have found in this study that physical galaxies generally contain density waves
strong enough to cause signicant mass redistribution over their lifetime In Figures 2
we show an image of the SBb galaxy NGC 1530 with superimposed corotation circles
and the resulting secular mass accretionexcretion rate calculated using the formulae
given in Zhang 1998 The calculated mass accretionexcretion rates for NGC 1530
with peak value around 145Myear are several orders of magnitude larger than for our
Galaxy  06Myear Zhang 1999 This dierence is due to the much larger density
wave amplitude average of 70 larger pitch angle 65o and larger surface density
average of 100Mpc2 of NGC 1530 compared to the Galaxy We have calculated
the same quantities for several other galaxies and obtained more moderate accretion
rates from a few to a few tens of Myear In early type galaxies the central mass
accretion rate can be much enhanced due to the presence of strong nuclear density wave
patterns even though the outer wave patterns generally become weaker as galaxies age
Thus density-wave induced radial mass accretion could serve as the main driver for the
morphological transformation of both the eld and cluster galaxies over the past Hubble
time as well as for fueling active galactic nuclei Furthermore the mass accretion of the
stellar component in addition to gas also means that most of the stellar population
of the bulge could form long before the shape of the bulge maintaining a homogeneous
and older stellar population of the bulge during the process of secular evolution This
helps to solve one of the main diculties in the secular building of bulges from the
accretion of the gas component alone which leads to a much varied stellar population
in the resulting bulges The same phase-shift-induced mass redistribution process also
works in galaxies which contain other skewed density distributions as observed in many
high-z proto galaxies
