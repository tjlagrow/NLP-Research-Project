ABSTRACT 
Innate and adaptive immunity are connected via antigen processing and presentation APP which 
results in the presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells in the complex with the major 
histocompatibility MHC determinants MHC class II MHC II determinants present antigens to 
CD 4 T cells which are the main regulators of the immune response Their genes are transcribed 
from compact promoters that form first the MHC II enhanceosome which contains DNA-bound 
activators and then the MHC II transcriptosome with the addition of the class II transactivator 
CIITA CIITA is the master regulator of MHC II transcription It is expressed constitutively in 
dendritic cells DC and mature B cells and is inducible in most other cell types Three isoforms of 
CIITA exist depending on cell type and inducing signals CIITA is regulated at the levels of 
transcription and post-translational modifications which are still not very clear Inappropriate 
immune responses are found in several diseases which include cancer and autoimmunity Since 
CIITA regulates the expression of MHC II genes it is involved directly in the regulation of the 
immune response The knowledge of CIITA will facilitate the manipulation of the immune 
response and might contribute to the treatment of these diseases     
INNATE AND ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY  
The immune system is composed of innate and adaptive branches which are 
nonspecific and specific ie they target common and unique parts of non-self 
antigens respectively Table 1 They discriminate between self and non-self and 
activate appropriate effectors Although innate and adaptive immunity appear 
independent appropriate interactions between them are indispensable for the 
normal function of the immune response Indeed mistakes that happen in either 
branch can affect the organism as a whole 
Innate immunity is the first defense against invading pathogens and performs the 
function of immune surveillance Calandra et al 2003 Janeway 2001 Cells that 
constitute innate immunity are antigen-presenting cells APC including DC 
macrophages and B cells Innate immunity does not develop any antigen 
specificity because the discrimination between self and non-self is primarily based 
on pathogen associated molecular patterns PAMP which are common 
components of many microorganisms and are not found in humans ie 
lipopolisacharides LPS Ligation of PAMP with toll-like receptors TLR on the 
surface of APC Bachmann and Kopf 2002 Takeda et al 2003 leads to 
phagocytosis and APP APP results in the presentation of processed antigens to T 
cells Cresswell and Lanzavecchia 2001 Fig1 and the establishment of 
adaptive immunity Kelly et al 2002 Smyth et al 2001  
The function of adaptive immunity is the elimination of non-self antigens and the 
creation of immune memory Constituents of adaptive immunity are B and T cells 
Adaptive immunity is unique and created only after the encounter with a specific 
non-self antigen which is presented to them by APC Discrimination between self 
and non-self at the level of adaptive immunity is complex and involves the 
elimination or functional inactivation of self-reactive lymphocytes from the 
repertoire Establishment of adaptive immunity is slow but once it is established 
it is memorized and able to respond faster to subsequent contacts with the same 
antigen However since innate immunity is faster it keeps infections under 
control until the establishment of adaptive immunity Smyth et al 2003 
Very important role in APP which connects innate and adaptive immunity play 
the MHC determinants Namely processed antigenic peptides are presented to T 
cells only in the groove of MHC heterodimers 
MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILLITY COMPLEX 
DETERMINANTS 
Genes that encode MHC determinants also known as human leukocyte antigens 
HLA are located on the short arm of chromosome six and are extraordinary 
polymorphic anonymous 1999 They are divided into two classes MHC I and 
MHC II determinants that present intracellular and extracellular antigens 
respectively MHC I determinants are expressed on most nucleated cells whereas 
MHC II determinants only on APC mature B and activated T cells  
Three different MHC I determinants namely HLA-A HLA-B and HLA-C are 
assembled and loaded with antigenic peptides which are generated by protein 
degradation in the 26S proteasome in the ER Fruci et al 2003 Saveanu et al 
2002 The complex between MHC I heterodimer and antigenic peptide passes 
through the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface of APC and activates CD8 T 
cells  
In humans there are three classical MHC II determinants termed HLA-DP HLA-
DQ and HLADR and two non-classical determinants named HLA-DM and 
HLADO Fig 2 The former are cell surface heterodimers that present antigenic 
peptides whereas the latter are cytoplasmic oligomers that are involved in loading 
of antigenic peptides HLA-DP HLA-DQ HLADR and HLA-DM are composed 
of  and  chains whereas HLA-DO form heterotetramers composed of two  
and two  chains Fig 2 Classical MHC II determinants are assembled in the ER 
in the complex with the invariant chain Ii which stabilizes them and prevents 
premature loading of antigenic peptides This complex is transported to the late 
endosome that contains degraded antigens Loading of antigenic peptides is a 
three-step process Fig 2 The first two steps which take place in the late 
endosome are the degradation and immediate replacement of Ii by the class II-
associated Ii-chain peptide CLIP The third step happens in the MHC class II 
compartment MIIC and is the exchange of CLIP with antigenic peptides This 
exchange is mediated by HLA-DM and is regulated by HLA-DO The complex 
between MHC II determinants and antigenic peptides then travels to the surface of 
APC where the antigen is presented to CD4 T cells which are the main 
regulators of the immune response 
Since they present antigens to CD4 T cells MHC II determinants are involved 
directly in the regulation of the immune response Therefore it is not surprising 
that the precise control of MHC II gene expression which takes place at the level 
of transcription is necessary for the equilibrated function of the immune system 
Most of our knowledge about this control has been elucidated from studies of the 
severe combined immunodeficiency called MHC II deficiency or the type II bare 
lymphocyte syndrome BLS Table 2  
BARE LYMPHOCYTE SYNDROME 
BLS is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by the lack of constitutive 
and inducible MHC II gene expression Table 2 reviewd in Reith and Mach 
2001 and Nekrep et al 2003 It is caused by mutations in factors that direct 
the transcription from MHC II promoters rather than in MHC II genes themselves 
More than ten years ago transcription of MHC II genes was known to require 
several unidentified proteins The earliest studies performed to identify these 
proteins employed in vitro assays which revealed many irrelevant DNA-protein 
interactions However only genetic studies of BLS finally resolved this puzzle 
First CIITA Steimle et al 1993 and regulatory factor X 5 RFX5 Steimle et 
al 1995 were identified which rescued the expression of MHC II determinants 
in complementation group CG A and C respectively Subsequently these 
findings led to the identification of regulatory factor X that contains ankyrin 
repeats RFXANKB Masternak et al 1998 Nagarajan et al 1999 and 
regulatory factor X associated protein RFXAP Durand et al 1997 that rescued 
the expression of MHC II determinants in CG B and D respectively These 
factors not only account for four CG of BLS but also represent all gene-specific 
trans-acting factors that bind cis-acting elements for MHC II transcription    
cis-ACTING ELEMENTS 
MHC II genes are transcribed from compact promoters Fig 3A They contain 
variable proximal promoter PPS and conserved upstream sequences CUS 
reviewed in Nekrep et al 2003 Reith and Mach 2001 Ting and Trowsdale 
2002  
In HLA-DRA PPS are located from position  52 to the transcription start site 
From the 5 direction they contain octamer binding site OBS and initiator Inr 
sequences but lack a functional TATA box OBS binds the octamer binding 
protein-1 Oct-1 which recruit the B cell octamer binding protein 1Octamer 
binding factor 1Oct coactivator from B cells Bob1OBF-1OCAB Matthias 
1998 whereas the initiator which represents the transcription start site binds 
RNA polymerase II associated transcription factor I TFIII and TATA binding 
protein TBP associated factor of 250 kDa TAFII250   
CUS are located from positions 139 to 67 From the 5 direction they contain 
S X and Y boxes X box can be further divided into X1 and X2 boxes Tight 
spatial constraints are preserved between these boxes Jabrane-Ferrat et al 1996 
which bind different trans-acting factors S and X1 boxes bind RFX Table 2 
Jabrane-Ferrat et al 1996 Ting and Trowsdale 2002 the X2 box binds X2 
binding protein X2BP which can be c-AMP responsive element binding protein 
CREBP or activator protein 1 AP-1 Moreno et al 1997 Setterblad et al 
1997 and the Y box binds nuclear factor Y NF-Y Table 2 Maity and de 
Crombrugghe 1998 Mantovani 1999  
However PPS and CUS are not sufficient for HLA-DRA gene expression A 
distal locus control region LCR which is located approximately 24 kb upstream 
of the CUS is needed for efficient transcription from the HLA-DRA promoter in 
the organism Masternak et al 2003 Fig 3 LCR is a mirror image of CUS It 
contains S X1 X2 and Y boxes but in the opposite orientation from the 
promoter Indeed the LCR binds the same trans-acting factors as the CUS  
trans-ACTING FACTORS  
Several trans-acting factors are required for MHC II transcription Fig 4 Among 
them RFX and NF-Y create the platform for other co-activators to access MHC II 
promoters     
NF-Y is composed of three subunits Table 2 reviewd in Matuoka and Yu 
Chen 1999 NF-YA contains 374 residues At the N-terminus of NF-YA there 
is glutamine-rich region which is followed by a stretch of prolines serines and 
threonines Its subunit interaction and DNA binding domains DBD are at the C-
terminus  
NF-YB contains 207 residues They form a histone fold and TATA-binding 
protein TBP binding domains The histone fold is similar to that of histones 2A 
and 2B Mantovani 1999 which is responsible for their dimerization This 
domain has the same function in the assembly of NF-Y 
NF-YC contains 335 residues As with NF-YB it contains a histone fold and TBP 
binding domains and in addition a glutamine-rich region  
RFX is also composed of three subunits Table 2 reviewd in Reith and Mach 
2001 RFXANKB contains 260 residues that form an acidic domain and four 
ankyrin repeats which gave it its name  
RFX5 contains 616 residues which form DBD and PEST domains It is the 5th 
member of the RFX family that binds S and X boxes of MHC II promoters which 
gave it its name  
RFXAP contains 272 residues This protein has acidic basic and glutamine-rich 
domains Because it interacts directly with RFX5 it was named the RFX 
associated protein  
Transcription from MHC II promoters starts after productive interactions between 
cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors which lead to the formation of the 
MHC II enhanceosome and transcriptosome 
MHC II ENHANCEOSOME AND TRANSCRIPTOSOME 
The MHC II enhanceosome is formed on CUS and LCR Its assembly requires 
specific protein-protein and DNA-protein interactions The formation of the 
enhanceosome starts off DNA Fig 5 where RFX and NF-Y bind loosely Both 
RFX and NF-Y are formed in two steps RFXANKB forms a complex with 
RFXAP which binds the RFX5 oligomer Jabrane-Ferrat et al 2002 NF-YB 
and NF-YC first form heterodimer via their histone folds and then bind NF-YA 
RFX and NF-Y are linked via interactions between RFXANKB NF-YA and NF-
YC Jabrane-Ferrat et al 2002 Nekrep et al 2003 Ting and Trowsdale 2002 
The binding of the enhanceosome to promoters occurs via DBD of RFX5 NF-YB 
and NF-YC Each individual contact between the enhanceosome and DNA takes 
place on the same side of the double helix As mentioned earlier preserved spatial 
constraints are present in CUS and LCR Completely invariant spacing between S 
and X boxes can be explained by the RFX5 oligomers which bind each others 
next to theirs DBD These higher ordered RFX complexes can occupy S and X 
boxes only if the exact spacing between them is preserved Between X and Y 
boxes are tolerated full helical turns This finding can be explained because their 
binding occurs far from DBD  
NF-Y not only interacts with RFX but also with different histone 
acetyltransferases HAT that make chromatin accessible for other co-activators 
Fontes et al 1999 Harton et al 2001  Moreover NF-YB and NF-YC bind 
TBP in vitro This interaction helps to attract general transcription factors GTF 
to promoters which lack a TATA box The X2 box is bound by CREBP or AP-1 
Moreno et al 1995 Setterblad et al 1997  
The very last step is the recruitment of CIITA to the MHC II enhanceosome 
which converts it into the MHC II transcriptosome Fig 5 Once the 
transcriptosome is formed MHC II genes can be transcribed   
CLASS II TRANSACTIVATOR 
CIITA is the master regulator of MHC II gene expression Except for CIITA all 
trans-acting factors that are needed for the transcription of MHC II genes are 
expressed ubiquitously Thus the synthesis of MHC II determinants correlates 
directly with the presence of CIITA which is expressed constitutively only in DC 
and mature B cells and is inducible in most other cell types After CIITA is 
recruited to the MHC II enhanceosome it recruits the general transcriptional 
machinery 
CIITA contains 1130 residues Fig 7 It can be divided into several domains 
which are the N- terminal activation AD prolineserinethreonine rich PST and 
GTP binding domains GBD as well as the C-terminal leucine rich region 
LRR Additionally CIITA contains three nuclear localization signals NLS and 
two putative nuclear export sequences NES Fig 7 
The optimal AD of CIITA spans the first 322 residues Its amino terminal part is 
rich in aspartic and glutamic acids and resembles the classical acidic AD similar 
to that of VP16 Indeed it can be replaced by AD from VP16 herpes simplex 
and E1a adenovirus Riley and Boss 1993 Between residues 145 and 322 is 
the PST domain As its name implies it contains several prolines serines and 
threonines that are targets for post-translational modifications A consensus PEST 
sequence is located from positions 283 to 308 but it does not represent a 
degradation motif or degron Schnappauf et al 2003 Rather degrons are located 
within the first 99 residues and from positions 230 to 260 of CIITA respectively 
Schnappauf et al 2003 
A putative GBD resides downstream of AD from positions 420 to 561 In 
contrast with the classical GBD which contain four GTP-interacting sequences 
CIITA contains only three Harton et al 1999 These are Walker type A motif 
G1 magnesium coordination site G3 and a site that confers specificity for 
guanosine G4 Indeed although CIITA binds GTP it does not hydrolyse it in 
vitro Harton et al 1999 This finding suggests that CIITA might be a 
constitutively active GTP-binding protein As mutations of either motif reduce the 
activity of CIITA the sole function of GTP binding to CIITA may be to alter its 
conformation  
Five or six consensus LRR are located from positions 988 to 1097 Harton et al 
2002 They bind a 33 kDa protein of unknown function Hake et al 2000 
Certain mutations positioned in  helices of LRR but not in  sheets decrease the 
activity of CIITA An additional LRR flanking the GBD might be involved in the 
aggregation of CIITA Linhoff et al 2001 
In CIITA three NLS and two NES have been described A bipartite NLS is 
located from positions 141 to 159 and two additional NLS were mapped from 
positions 405 to 414 next to G1 and 940 to 963 in the LRR Cressman et al 1999 
Cressman et al 2001 Nekrep et al 2002 Spilianakis et al 2000 NES have 
been poorly characterized The first is located in the first 114 residues the second 
from positions 408 to 550 Kretsovali et al 2001 However none of these NLS 
and NES have been examined directly  
REGULATION OF CIITA GENE EXPRESSION 
Since the transcription of MHC II genes is dependent on the presence of CIITA it 
is not surprising that its expression is highly regulated In general there are two 
types of regulation of gene expression genetic and epigenetic CIITA employs 
both Whereas specific activators dictate active transcription epigenetic silencing 
occurs via chromatin condensation 
Transcription of CIITA can be initiated from up to three different promoters PI 
PIII and PIV Fig 6 Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1997 In DC and mature B cells 
constitutive expression of CIITA is initiated from PI and PIII respectively 
Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1997 IFN- inducible expression of CIITA is 
mediated by PI and PIV in bone marrow derived APC DC and somatic cells 
respectively Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1997 Waldburger et al 2001 All 
promoters have a unique exon 1 which is spliced into the common exon 2 
Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1997 Translation of CIITA transcripts from PI and 
PIII starts from the first methionine in exon 1 whereas from PIV it begins from 
the first methionine in exon 2 This brings unique sequences to the N-terminus of 
CIITA Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1997 and results in three isoforms IF of 
CIITA IF I IF III and IF IV IF I and IF III contain additional 94 and 17 residues 
respectively The additional sequence in IF I bears homology with the caspase 
recruitment domain CARD Nickerson et al 2001 and most likely represents a 
new protein-protein interaction domain It also has the highest transcriptional 
activity Nickerson et al 2001 Importantly a single mutation of a conserved 
leucine in CARD abrogates the activity of CIITA Nickerson et al 2001  
Epigenetic regulation of CIITA gene expression is utilized for embryonic 
survival Notably immune responses against paternal antigens in the placenta 
cause fetal death In these tissues promoter hypermethylation and histone 
deacetylation are proposed mechanisms for silencing the transcription of CIITA 
Holtz et al 2003 Morris et al 2000 van den Elsen et al 2000 Derepression 
of CIITA transcription in trophoblasts after treatment with methylation inhibitors 
and trichostatin A with IFN- supports this mechanism  
In immature DC the expression of CIITA is observed from PI but it does not lead 
to APP Phagocytosis of an antigen leads to the maturation of DC which is 
accompanied by the cessation of further phagocytosis and repression of de novo 
CIITA and MHC II transcription and up-regulation of APP Cella et al 1997 
Landmann et al 2001 Pierre et al 1997 Turley et al 2000 These events 
might be mediated by TLR Because only the specific population of encountered 
antigens are processed and presented to T cells such regulation could represent 
the best way of establishing adaptive immunity Because the expression of CIITA 
is shut down after the clearance of a foreign antigen it also lowers the chance of 
DC randomly presenting self-antigens   
In B cells the constitutive expression of CIITA from PIII is accompanied by the 
presence of high levels of MHC II determinants on the cell surface However 
after B cells differentiate into highly specialized antibody producing plasma cells 
the expression of CIITA and MHC II determinants is lost Chen et al 2002 B 
lymphocyte inhibitory maturation protein 1 BLIMP1 begins the process of this 
silencing Piskurich et al 2000  
CIITA gene expression can be induced with IFN- from PI and PIV PIV contains 
gamma-activated sites GAS which bind the signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 1 STAT1 and an interferon regulatory factor-1 binding site which 
binds interferon regulatory factor-1 IRF-1 Muhlethaler-Mottet et al 1998 
Since PI is also responsive to IFN- it could contain the same elements After 
stimulation with IFN- activated phosphorylated STAT 1 translocates into the 
nucleus and binds GAS Activated STAT 1 also induces the expression and 
accumulation of IRF-1 Binding of STAT 1 to GAS itself causes a weak 
acetylation of histones 3 and 4 in PIV Morris et al 2002 However the 
hyperacetylation of histones which makes transcription more efficient happens 
only after the accumulation and binding of IRF-1 to its site  
Thus the regulation of transcription of the CIITA gene represents the first level of 
control of CIITA function The second level consists of post-translational 
modifications of CIITA 
POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS OF CIITA   
CIITA is post-translationaly modified by acetylation phosphorylation and 
ubiquitylation Fig 8 Effects of these modifications are complex and far from 
being clearly understood but a general picture can be drawn from several studies 
The fate of CIITA in the cell is not random but each step starting after its 
translation and ending with its possible degradation is regulated precisely by the 
following modifications     
Phosphorylation is the first post-translational modification of CIITA Two studies 
have shown that this modification increases the activity of CIITA The first study 
mapped phosphorylation sites into the PST region from positions 253 to 321 Tosi 
et al 2002 The second study showed that protein kinase A PKA 
phosphorylates CIITA on one or more serines in the region between PST and 
GBD Sisk et al 2003 The phosphorylation of CIITA leads to its accumulation 
oligomerization and nuclear translocation Most likely these latter events happen 
because the phosphorylation changes the conformation of CIITA and exposes its 
After it translocates into the nucleus CIITA is acetylated on lysines 141 and 144 
by CBPp300 and also by pCAF which are located in the nucleus Spilianakis et 
al 2000 Acetylation of these residues keeps CIITA in the nucleus and increases 
the stability of the MHC II transcriposome Acetylation might also facilitate the 
subsequent ubiquitylation of CIITA Indeed recent data suggest that histone 
deacetylases HDAC are involved in the ubiquitylation of CIITA Greer et al 
2003  
Ubiquitylation which is a covalent modification of lysines plays an important 
role in transcription Monoubiquitylated transcription factors tend to be more 
potent activators whereas polyubiquitylated proteins are destined for degradation 
by the 26S proteasome The role of ubiquitylation of CIITA has been addressed in 
two studies but clear conclusions on the function of ubiquitin cannot be reached 
In the first study monoubiquitin fused to CIITA prevented the degradation of the 
modified CIITA protein but did not affect its transcriptional activity Schnappauf 
et al 2003 In the second study CIITA co-expressed with ubiquitin had a higher 
activity than CIITA alone which was even more pronounced if ubiquitin could 
not form oligomers Greer et al 2003 This effect of ubiquitin was on the 
stabilization of the MHC II transcriptosome rather than on transcription itself 
Interestingly the same study showed that HDAC prevent the ubiquitylation of 
CIITA  
Phosphorylation also completes the post-translational modifications of CIITA 
Interestingly PKA inactivates CIITA with phosphorylation of serines 834 and 
1050 Li et al 2001 Does this modification influence the stability of the 
enhanceosome Does it lead to the degradation of CIITA or does it expose the 
NES and enables the export of CIITA from the nucleus  
CIITA IS SHUTTLING  PROTEIN 
Transcription factors and co-factors need to be transported into the nucleus to 
perform their function Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling usually requires two types of 
functionally unique signals NLS and NES CIITA contains both but none of 
them have been examined adequately Fig 7  
At steady state CIITA is distributed equally between the nucleus and the 
cytoplasm Mutant CIITA proteins which do not follow this pattern led to the 
identification of NLS As mentioned earlier two NLS are located at the N-
terminus and one NLS in the C-terminus of CIITA Fig 7 Cressman et al 
1999 Cressman et al 2001 Spilianakis et al 2000 However none of them 
has been examined directly ie they have not been demonstrated to shuttle a 
heterologous protein Moreover binding to importins has not been investigated  
Two regions in the N-terminus of CIITA have been proposed to function as NES 
Fig 7 The only support comes from interactions between these regions with the 
chromosomal region maintenance-1 Crm-1 protein Kretsovali et al 2001 
Indeed treatment with leptomycin B LMB which blocks Crm-1 dependent 
nuclear export Kudo et al 1998 leads to the nuclear accumulation of CIITA 
Cressman et al 2001 Kretsovali et al 2001 However no consensus NES can 
be found within these sequences In addition none of the five putative NES three 
of which correspond perfectly to the consensus sequence Lx23Lx23-LxL 
functioned in a direct export nor bound Crm-1 Drozina Kohoutek Peterlin 
unpublished observation  
All these results imply the presence of other transport mechanisms Indeed 
several additional regions of CIITA are involved in its nuclear localization 
including GBD Harton et al 1999 Raval et al 2003 and LRR Hake et al 
2000 Harton et al 2002 Towey and Kelly 2002 Moreover some mutations in 
the LRR disrupt interaction between p33 and CIITA which interferes with its 
nuclear localization Hake et al 2000 Furthermore it was suggested that NES 
from CIITA resemble that of snurportin-1 which is discontinuous Paraskeva et 
al 1999 In this case only after a conformational change can Crm-1 bind and 
transport snurportin-1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm Paraskeva et al 1999 
CIITA IS TRANSCRIPTIONAL  INTEGRATOR  
Once CIITA is modified appropriately and present in the nucleus it can perform 
its function It binds to the MHC II enhanceosome attracts several transcription 
factors and co-factors and integrates initiation and elongation of transcription as 
well as chromatin remodeling into a process that finally results in the expression 
of MHC II genes Moreover CIITA might also be involved in the dissociation of 
the MHC II enhanceosome after the termination of transcription  
CIITA recruits RNA polymerase II RNAPII to MHC II promoters and increases 
rates of initiation and elongation of transcription For the former function 
interactions with TAF Fontes et al 1997 TFIIB Mahanta et al 1997 and 
Bob1OBF-1OCAB Fontes et al 1996 might be necessary For the latter the 
interaction between CIITA and the positive transcription elongation factor b P-
TEFb which phosphorylates the CTD of RNAPII is needed Kanazawa et al 
2000    
Not surprisingly CIITA also recruits HAT and chromatin remodeling machinery 
to the HLA-DRA promoter The AD of CIITA binds CBPp300 Fontes et al 
1999 pCAF Spilianakis et al 2000 and Brahma-related gene 1 BRG-1 
Mudhasani and Fontes 2002 In addition it has been suggested that CIITA 
posseses intrinsic HAT activity Harton et al 2001 Raval et al 2001 This 
activity of CIITA has been mapped into AD and bears homology with other HAT 
domains eg in CBPp300 Harton et al 2001 Interestingly CIITA that lacks 
its AD is still able to mediate the acetylation of histone 4 but not of histone 3 
Beresford and Boss 2001 Thus CIITA could contain another region with direct 
or indirect HAT activity  
After the termination of transcription deacetylation of histones which is mediated 
by HDAC is involved in chromatin condensation Binding of CIITA to HDAC1 
and HDAC2 decreases the activity of CIITA most probably because histone 
deacetylation disrupts the MHC II enhanceosome Zika et al 2003 Thus CIITA 
might play an active role in the regulation of its own function on MHC II 
promoters  
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In the last few years much research resulted in greater understanding of the 
function and regulation of CIITA Since CIITA plays a major role in the 
regulation of the immune response via MHC II determinants this is not 
surprising Moreover if one understood the rules of this regulation one could 
use this knowledge for the manipulation of the immune system However many 
questions remain 
Why is CIITA transcribed from three distinct promoters Are different IF of 
CIITA modified differently which influences their activity and regulation  
Are post-translational modifications independent from each other or are they 
carefully orchestrated or sequential The phosphorylation of CIITA increases or 
decreases the activity of CIITA depending on phosphorylated residues What 
signals regulate this phosphorylation that results in activation and inactivation of 
CIITA respectively and how Why does the acetylated CIITA protein 
accumulate in the nucleus What is the role of its ubiquitylation Where is CIITA 
ubiquitylated These and probably many more questions regarding the post-
translational modifications of CIITA still need to be answered 
The shuttling of CIITA is a big puzzle Since CIITA has not been shown to bind 
importins and since no NES can be found how does CIITA shuttle And why 
does it shuttle at all  
A lot is known about the cis-acting elements in the MHC II promoters but the 
role of LCR needs more attention What is the mode of action of these LCR Do 
they also bring P-TEFb to RNAPII How many LCR are there in the MHC 
cluster  
Once these questions have been answered the manipulation of the immune 
system could become possible and eventually applicable in clinical medicine 
Cancer and inadequate vaccination represent weak immune responses 
Introduction of the constitutively active CIITA proteins could turn cancer cells 
into APC They would then present their own antigenic peptides to CD4 T cells 
to activate and direct immune response against transformed cells Vaccination 
could also be more effective with the addition of CIITA Autoimmunity is caused 
by the inappropriate responses to self-antigens Dominant negative CIITA 
proteins could attenuate immune responses as well as the need for other 
immunosuppressive therapies Thus CIITA could become a new tool for 
immunotherapy in humans
