Abstract This article discusses the our changing knowledge of the evolution of
AGN from an optical perspective It focusses on optically-unobscured type-1
AGN as it is much trickier to investigate the evolution type-2 objects from an
optical point of view It discusses major optical survey work that improved our
knowledge of QSO evolution during the last ve years It touches on the shape
of the QSO luminosity function on the peak of QSO activity the quest for red-
dened QSOs and spectral evolution Finally it summarizes recent advances in the
research of host galaxies which probably hold the key for the triggering mecha-
nisms of the activity and reiterates the diculty of understanding the physical
evolution of AGN and its place in the context of galaxy evolution

1 Introduction
Shortly after the discovery of quasars it
was understood that these objects are tru-
ely remarkable not only in their physical
nature but also in their cosmological evo-
lution Schmidt 1968 1970 observed a
very sharp decline in the space density of
quasars over roughly a factor of 100 from
z  2 to z  0 This decline was so re-
markable that it could be credibly demon-
strated from a sample as small as 20 ob-
jects The interpretation was supported by
V Vmax tests developed for this purpose at
the time The strong evolution clearly ap-
plied to both objects selected optically and
those selected from their radio emission At
the time it suggested that quasars were the
most dramatically evolving population of
objects in the Universe
It was later understood that quasars
are only one part of a larger population
of objects commonly called Active Galactic
Nuclei or AGN From an optical perspec-
tive a dening characteristic of AGN is
non-stellar continuum radiation More sen-
sitive observations showed that also light
from luminous and young stars is some-
times found in AGN suggesting that star
formation may be occuring in the host
galaxy and may have a common trigger
with the nuclear activity AGN have been
observed over a wide range of luminosi-
ties which presently covers eight orders of
magnitude across MB  10 30 This
range poses a challenge for observations
aiming at understanding the phenomenon
at the lowest luminosities the host galaxy
outshines the active nucleus making it
hard to detect At the highest luminosities
the AGN outshines the host galaxy making
C Wolf Evolution of AGN - optical view
the latter almost impossible to detect let
alone to investigate Traditionally unob-
scured AGN at MB  23 have been called
QSOs This denition does not reect any
physical limits but is motivated by obser-
vational practicalities here the AGN is lu-
minous enough to dominate the combined
spectrum over the host galaxy making its
AGN nature easy to recognize
This article focusses on the more lumi-
nous half MB  20 of the range cov-
ered by AGN where  95 of the total lu-
minosity density is emitted Besides these
bright unobscured type-1 objects there is
an entire class of optically obscured type-2
AGN with a very signicant contribution
to the cosmic black hole accretion history
However being optically obscured makes
these objects hard to nd and study from
an optical point of view although their host
galaxies are clearly observable Hence this
article will give more weight to type-1 ob-
jects here called QSOs irrespective of their
luminosity
2 QSO Evolution  5 Years Ago
A useful instrument to quantify the activ-
ity statistics of AGN is their luminosity
function LF Only ve years ago there
was still confusion about the evolutionary
pattern of the type-1 LF While a strong
increase of the activity out to z  2
had been established a long time before
and a turnover must be trivially expected
at higher redshift somewhere the shape
of the turnover and the redshift of any
peak in activity was still unclear Boyle
Shanks  Peterson 1988 described the
LF at z  03 22 with a broken power-
law characterized by the parameters Lz
and z These allowed to distinguish
between simple evolutionary models such
as Pure Luminosity Evolution PLE and
Pure Density Evolution PDE with PLE
being the preferred description for the low-
redshift z  2 evolution of QSOs At high
redshift z  27 47 Schmidt Schneider 
Gunn 1995 parametrized the LF with a
single power-law that does not feature any
break luminosity because their small sam-
ple and narrow luminosity range did not
constrain any more parameters In their L-
range they found a strong decrease in the
activity when going towards higher red-
shift Finally Warren Hewitt  Osmer
1994 bridged the gap and investigated
the turnover within z  20 45 Their
model t followed a complicated descrip-
tion of luminosity-dependent density evo-
lution LDDE with a strong high-redshift
cuto at z  33
While the rise and fall of quasars be-
tween the Big Bang and today was estab-
lished by these observations there was still
disagreement on the shape and redshift of
the turnover Eg at z  22 36 the
selection of QSOs from colours was di-
cult due to abundant stars having simi-
lar colours as the rare QSOs and hence
quantifying the selection function carefully
was nearly impossible Furthermore each
QSO sample at z  2 contained only a few
dozen objects across a narrow luminosity
range which left the shape of the LF un-
constrained for details see Osmer 2003 and
references therein Clearly larger surveys
mapping the luminosity-redshift plane as
widely as possible were needed to advance
the eld of QSO evolution
3 Recent Optical Surveys
A number of surveys were carried out
to overcome all the shortcomings of pre-
vious optical surveys for QSOs such as
dicult selection functions narrow lumi-
nosity ranges and small samples I list
six important and complementary surveys
here which have produced results in recent
1 the brightest  400 objects were ob-
served in the wide-area objective-prism
Hamburg-ESO-Survey HES Wisotzki
2000 at B  17 z  00 32
2 the 2dF Quasar Redshift Survey 2QZ
Boyle et al 2000 Croom et al 2004
found large numbers  23 000 of
QSOs at z  03 22 and B  21
C Wolf Evolution of AGN - optical view
3 the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
York et al 2000 collects the largest
QSO sample to date with important
complete subsamples at z  36 i  20
Fan et al 2001
4 the COMBO-17 survey Wolf et al
2003 selected QSOs reliably at z 
1 5 with detailed SEDs from 17 lters
providing the deepest large sample
5 the BTC-40 survey Monier et al 2001
targetted specically the very high-z
end at z  48 conrming just two of
these rare QSOs to date
6 a Lyman-break-selected galaxy sample
Steidel et al 2002 providing a small
but the deepest probe into nuclear ac-
tivity at z  3 Hunt et al 2004
All these surveys selected their object
samples by colour and all except for HES
and COMBO-17 assembled a QSO sam-
ple by spectroscopic follow-up of a sub-
set In contrast HES and COMBO-17 had
their spectroscopic information already ob-
tained in the rst observational step HES
is based on object prism spectroscopy and
collapsed spectra into colours for selec-
tion the COMBO-17 lters have sucient
number and spectral resolution to identify
QSOs and measure accurate redshifts from
photometry alone
Indeed
enlarged statistics on
colours and spectra of QSOs allowed to
develop the technique of photometric red-
shifts for QSOs to maturity broad-band
colours such as the SDSS ugriz bands lead
to photo-z errors of z  02 or  01
in photo-z codes based on QSO templates
Richards et al 2001 or using neural nets
Budavari et al 2001 respectively In the
COMBO-17 lter set the larger number of
lters leads to a much more complete iden-
tication of QSOs especially in the range
of the suspected turnover at z  2 4 The
higher spectral resolution of medium-band
lters leads to much smaller photo-z errors
of z1  z  0015 for QSOs Wolf et al
2004 Similar work in the CADIS survey
did not take variability into account and
the resulting variation in observed colours
led to a number of redshift outliers there
Wolf et al 1999 The latter comparison
demonstrates the importance of simulta-
neous colours for photometric redshifts of
The analysis of these surveys has re-
sulted in LFs covering dierent parts of
the redshift-luminosity plane and we have
found that space densities mostly agree well
between surveys where redshift and lumi-
nosity ranges overlap Especially
shown that the COMBO-17 LF is consis-
tent with 2QZ at low redshift and smoothly
turns over into the SDSS LF at high red-
shift see Fig 1 and Wolf et al 2003 pro-
viding the previously missing link
31 Shape of the luminosity function
luminosity functions
surveys overlap
from dif-
they tend to
agree However the parts of the redshift-
luminosity plane measured by more than
one survey are not large and there are still
some remaining issues about survey incom-
pleteness and its correction
The largest newly observed sample is
from 2QZ and covers redshifts of z 
03 22 The resulting LFs can be t to
broken power laws and give satisfactory ts
for a PLE-type model However 2QZ se-
lects candidates from broad-band colours
and thus has a bias against low-luminosity
QSOs with bright host galaxies where the
latter dominate the colours Some of the
attening of the towards the faint end may
result from this incompleteness and it is
not clear that a broken power law is the
required function
At the brightest end the HES has found
some mild curvature in the LF At very low
redshifts of z  03 it should clearly allow
to see the L knee in the LF suggested by
the early broken power-laws and seen again
by the 2QZ survey However while there is
curvature in the LF and attening towards
lower luminosities a broken power-law does
not match the HES results which instead
suggest a steeper faint LF than 2QZ
C Wolf Evolution of AGN - optical view
At high redshifts of z  36 the SDSS
sample has improved over the original
SSG95 result The results do not allow to
constrain LF curvature due to small sam-
ple size and a narrow luminosity range yet
However the slope of the SDSS high-z LF
is atter than the 2QZ slope at lower red-
shift suggesting evolution in the LF shape
The COMBO-17 sample bridged the
gap between 2QZ and SDSS with complete
selection and furthermore extended the
LFs to much fainter limits The COMBO-
17 LF shows again mild curvature but
no L break in its low-luminosity range
Combined with the SDSS LF COMBO-17
shows a attening of the high-z LF as a
faint extrapolation of the single power-law
SDSS LF exceeds the COMBO-17 counts
The Steidel et al Lyman-break sample
provides the deepest probe although the
object number does not help to constrain
the faint-end slope or LF curvature reli-
ably It was argued that this sample com-
bined with the WHO94 results suggested
an L break with a strong slope change
However combining the larger samples
from COMBO-17 and SDSS gives consis-
tent results in terms of a smoothly curved
LF without a distinct break
Altogther these results suggest that the
LF of QSOs is smoothly curved but we
have not seen a compelling case for a strong
L break which could be traced as a clue to
the physical evolution of QSOs underlying
our observations
32 Peak of AGN activity
The peak of the cosmic AGN activity would
be measured best by the integrated AGN
luminosity density which could potentially
be used as a crude proxy for the total
BH accretion once the conversion becomes
clearer The faint COMBO-17 observations
have demonstrated that the L-range of ex-
isting samples probably covers  95 of
the total blue AGN luminosity density
Thus variations in the further faint extrap-
olation would change the total luminosity
density only little COMBO-17 found an
Fig 1 QSO space densities from 2QZ
COMBO-17 and SDSS Fan et al 2001
agree very well The dierent curves show
densities according to the best-tting mod-
els from each survey integrated to dier-
ent limiting luminosities of M145Vega 
28     24 Dashed lines are extrapola-
tions to fainter magnitudes
activity peak at z  20 based on its LF
at MB  22 In contrast the much shal-
lower HES found the luminosity density to
rise further out to its survey limit at z  32
from an LF integrated at MB  28 This
comparison claries that high-luminosity
QSOs reached their activity peak earlier
than low-luminosity objects and implies
that the shape of the QSO LF changes with
time The same behaviour was also found in
X-ray selected samples where low-Lx AGN
peak at z  075 Cowie et al 2003 Steen
et al 2003 This phenomenon is called cos-
mic downsizing and describes a scenario
in which comparatively large members of a
population undergo the critical evolution-
ary epoch rst with members of a progres-
sively smaller kind showing up only later
This downsizing trend provides an impor-
tant constraint for theories of co-evolution
between AGN and their host galaxies

33 Reddened QSOs
from the
subject of optically-
obscured QSOs the optical community
occasionally wondered about missing red
reddened QSOs which may escape
colour selection or show unexpected spec-
tral shapes Recently a careful study of
a large SDSS QSO sample in combination
with 2MASS photometry investigated the
detailed continuum properties of QSOs at
z  22 Richards et al 2003 Hopkins
et al 2004 This work showed that the
QSO population could best be explained
by a distribution of intrinsic spectral slopes
  075 025 combined with dust
reddening at the redshift of the QSO pos-
sibly with an SMC-type dust law It was
shown that the AGN continuum and the
broad-line region BLR were reddened to
the same degree but the narrow-line region
NLR remained unaected The mean red-
dening was measured to be hEBV i  003
while the SDSS selection procedure was
shown to be sensitive to EBV  05
Only 2 of the parent population of type-
1 QSOs was found to be reddened with
EBV  01 A total of  10 of QSOs are
lost from the SDSS sample by extinction
pushing objects below the ux limit not
due to reddening-induced colour changes
34 Optically obscured QSOs
The canonical model of AGN involves a
dusty torus around the accreting black
hole which absorbs optical
signatures
of the central engine on certain lines-
of-sight while keeping a type-1 appear-
ance at other viewing angles Among low-
luminosity AGN this picture had been con-
rmed through the unication of Seyfert-1
galaxies with Seyfert-2 galaxies The key
observation in the latter was a detection
of unobscured AGN light which was scat-
tered and polarized by low-density dust
residing far above the absorbing torus plane
and being freely illuminated by the AGN
Seyfert-2 galaxies had been found abun-
dantly as counterparts to Seyfert-1 galax-
ies but only with low luminosity Five years
ago optically obscured QSOs with high
luminosity were still at large although a
radio galaxy at z  044 allegedly the
most powerful IRAS source was a good
candidate for a type-2 QSO Kleinmann et
al 1988 and further X-ray-based evidence
was obtained by Franceschini et al 2000
More recently very signicant progress
was made with deep X-ray surveys and op-
tical identication of faint X-ray sources
by spectroscopic follow-up Several type-2
QSOs were found with Chandra and XMM
reaching up to z  37 Norman et al
2002 It has been conrmed that type-
2 objects dominate the population at low
luminosity but their fraction drops when
going to high luminosities At this point
it seems unclear which population domi-
nates the nuclear accretion budget because
of the debate on how to correct for com-
pleteness in follow-up identication Eg
Treister et al this volume suggest that
with proper correction type-2 objects ac-
count for 34 of the integrated X-ray lu-
minosity even at z  2 where we only see
higher-Lx objects
Maybe somewhat unexpectedly
subject of optically obscured AGN has been
advanced through extensive work based on
optical selection in the SDSS spectroscopic
database Kaumann et al 2003 have se-
lected type-2 AGN at z  03 by sub-
tracting the stellar continuum and star
formation-related components from emis-
sion lines to isolate the AGN emission
from the NLR Zakamska et al 2003
2004 have pushed further in redshift by
applying such a technique to the whole
SDSS spectral database They isolated a
serendipitous sample at z  03 08 with
 150 type-2 QSOs dened by LOIII 
3  108Lsol and many lower-luminosity ob-
jects Their AGN nature was further con-
rmed by showing that this class of ob-
jects is MIRFIR-luminous and has hard
X-ray colours However in contrast to the
Kaumann et al sample at z  03 the
statistical completeness of the Zakamska et
al sample is presently unclear
C Wolf Evolution of AGN - optical view
While X-ray surveys played a funda-
mental role in mapping out the obscured
population they still need to improve in
area and opticalNIR follow-up needs to
reach deeper before the obscured samples
at high-z will catch up in usefulness with
type-1 samples We will need a good z L-
map of the type-12 fraction not only to
observe the entire nuclear accretion bud-
get but also in order to constrain models
of torus evolution
35 Evolution of spectral properties
Any evolution in spectral properties of
QSOs would hold important clues about
changes in the physical conditions in AGN
which would help very much to interpret
the AGN phenomenon beyond the above
discussed bean counting exercises of the
many surveys However no signicant red-
shift evolution has been observed in the
properties of either the continuum or the
emission lines Pentericci et al 2003 com-
plemented the optical data of 45 SDSS
QSOs at z  36 50 with JHK photome-
try and found a mean spectral slope of  
057  033 which is fully consistent with
the QSOs at low redshift Emission lines
were found to display various anti- cor-
relations between their equivalent widths
EWs and the continuum luminosity of the
source also known as Baldwin eects But
no evolution was found for EWs with red-
shift leaving us with no evidence for chem-
ical evolution Croom et al 2002 Dietrich
et al 2002 Also no evolution with redshift
has been found in a relation between black
hole mass and QSO luminosity MBH 
LQSO see Corbett et al 2003 and refer-
ences therein
4 Host galaxies of AGN
The eld of AGN host galaxies has seen
great progress over the last few years and
is the most promising approach to un-
derstand which phenomenon triggers nu-
clear activity Type-1 QSOs have typically
been studied with HST because any bright
seeing-enlarged central light source swamps
the light of the host galaxy making the
delicate subtraction of the overpowering
AGN source impossible Adaptive optics
may become an alternative ground-based
technique but suer currently still from
signicant and variable wings in their PSF
Type-2 AGN appear like pure host galaxies
in the optical and NIR and are hence trivial
to examine
Kukula et al 2001 and Dunlop et
al 2003 targetted type-1 QSOs of lu-
minosity MV  235 with NICMOS at
z  09 19 and with WFPC2 at z  02
respectively These monochromatic images
showed host galaxies to be normal giant el-
lipticals obeying the normal Kormendy re-
lation expected at their redshifts
Kaumann et al 2003 examined type-
2 AGN at z  03 in the SDSS spectro-
scopic sample and found normal-looking
early-type spheroidal galaxies as well as
some disks and disturbed systems At low-
est AGN luminosities these exhibit the
usual red colours expected in early-type
galaxies but at higher luminosity they
show a mild excess of blue star light
compared to non-AGN early-type objects
Detailed diagnostics using the H absorp-
tion line suggest that most of them experi-
enced a starburst within the previous Gyr
Most recently two studies on low-
luminosity type-1 AGN MV  24 20
measured not only shapes but also colours
of type-1 hosts Jahnke et al investigated
a sample at z  02 and Sanchez et al
used a z  05 11 sample from the GEMS
Galaxy Evolution from Morphologies and
SEDs survey They both found mostly
spheroidal morphologies but also some
disks Again many early-types showed a
moderate excess of blue star light compared
to non-AGN
These studies appear to show consis-
tently that AGN live mostly but not ex-
clusively in young bulges
ie mostly
large ellipticals with a moderate excess of
blue stellar light compared to non-AGN el-
lipticals This suggests that the AGN phe-
nomenon is accompanied by some amount
C Wolf Evolution of AGN - optical view
of star formation which is either still on-
going or has predated the AGN phase as
a recent starburst This picture is not sur-
prising given that a powerful AGN requires
both a massive black hole and abundant
fuel supply to operate While only mas-
sive early-type galaxies would contain such
black holes only galaxies with signicant
recent or ongoing star formation provide
the fuel supply
5 AGN evolution in the context of
galaxy evolution
The hierarchical paradigm holds major
mergers responsible for triggering star-
bursts and for the transport of gas to
nuclear regions leading to AGN activ-
ity with AGN feedback potentially heat-
ing and clearing away remaining gas from
the host and terminating star formation
Incidentally major mergers also lead to
the formation of spheroidal galaxies which
will need a Gyr or more to settle onto the
red sequence of non-star-forming passively
evolving galaxies This picture is broadly
consistent with the observations of AGN
host galaxies
Observations of a relationship between
quiescent black-hole masses and the veloc-
ity dispersion of the hosting galaxy bulge
Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et
al 2000 have suggested a co-evolution
of galaxies and AGN This relation can
be further developed into a relation be-
tween MBH and stellar mass of
bulge However recently Treu Malkan 
Blandford 2004 found the MBH- rela-
tion at z  037 oset from the one at
z  0 If this result is conrmed it implies
that AGN were active and black holes have
grown before the stellar bulges reached
their nal mass On a currently more spec-
ulative side high-resolution VLA observa-
tion made by Walter et al 2004 support
this view claiming that the host galaxy
of the highest-redshift QSO known SDSS
J11485251 at z  642 consists mostly of
molecular gas with very little room left for
stellar mass eectively ruling out the pres-
ence of a 1012 Msol stellar bulge required
by the local MBH- relation
6 Summary
In the recent ve years observers have
made great progress in mapping the cosmic
nuclear accretion history The luminosity
function of type-1 QSOs has been mapped
over ever larger ranges of the redshift-
luminosity plane We have reached rea-
sonable consistency between dierent sur-
veys and have constrained most of the UV-
optical AGN luminosity density within the
range of existing surveys We have found no
evidence of spectral evolution - AGN ap-
pear to be always the same kind of animal
irrespective of the epoch of observation
The census of optically-obscured type-
2 AGN is starting to catch up but there is
still much work needed to understand their
contribution at redshift z  1 Whether we
look at obscured or unobscured AGN at
X-ray or optical luminosities we probably
see a pattern of cosmic downsizing among
AGN where high-luminosity AGN were the
rst active objects in the early Universe
while lower-luminosity AGN lagged behind
and only became abundant later
At redshift z  2 we see AGN of ei-
ther type being hosted predominantly by
elliptical galaxies with little morphologi-
cal disturbance and some extra light from
younger stars They do not appear particu-
larly disturbed and do not undergo simulta-
neous starbursts In principle AGN could
be a late phase of major mergers where the
nuclear activity only commences after the
merger has relaxed into a regular elliptical
although this is not the only permitted in-
terpretation
On the whole it is still unclear how to
constrain the physical evolution of AGN
and how to place them into the context of
galaxy evolution New estimates of black
hole masses in the more distant Universe
and observations of host galaxies at very
high redshift might still harbor quite a few
surprises for us
