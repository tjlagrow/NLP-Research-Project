Abstract We studied the fraction and properties of bars in a sample of about
3000 galaxies extracted from SDSS-DR5 This represents a volume limited sam-
ple with galaxies located between redshift 001  z  004 absolute magnitude
Mr  20 and inclination i  60 Interacting galaxies were excluded from the
sample The fraction of barred galaxies in our sample is 45 We found that
32 of S0s 55 of early-type spirals and 52 of late-type spirals are barred
galaxies The bars in S0s galaxies are weaker than those in later-type galaxies
The bar length and galaxy size are correlated being larger bars located in larger
galaxies Neither the bar strength nor bar length correlate with the local galaxy
density On the contrary the bar properties correlate with the properties of
their host galaxies Galaxies with higher central light concentration host less
and weaker bars
1 Detection and characterization of bars
Large galaxy surveys allows to study the bar properties in the local universe
for a statistically signicant sample of galaxies We selected in SDSS-DR5 a
volume-limited sample of about 3000 galaxies with redshift 001  z  004
absolute magnitude Mr  20 and inclination i  60 They were selected to
no show evidence of interaction Bars were detected using two dierent methods
ellipse tting and Fourier analysis They were calibrated and tested using mock
barred and non-barred galaxies similar to the observed ones We present here
the results obtained with the ellipse tting method since it resulted to be more
ecient than Fourier analysis in detecting bars We found a bar in 45 of our
disk galaxies in good agreement with Barazza et al
2007 As far as the
morphological type concerns 32 of S0s 55 of early-type spirals and 52 of
late-type spirals are barred galaxies The bar length was measured either as the
radius corresponding to the maximum isophotal ellipticity or as the radius where
the isophotal position angle changes more than 5 It correlates with the galaxy
size which was dened as 25  r90 where r90 is the radius enclosing 90 of the
total ux The bar strength was calculated using the parameter fbar Whyte et
al 2002 Bars in S0s galaxies are weaker than those in later-type galaxies

The local galaxy density 5 was estimated using the method of the distance to
the fth nearest neighbor There is no correlation between the presence Fig

relation of the dierent bar properties with the light concentration index C 
r90r50 We found that bars were preferentially hosted in galaxies with lower
light concentration Fig 1 central panel Moreover bars are preferentially
hosted by bluer galaxies Fig 1 right panel
3 Conclusions
Bars were observed in 45 of our disk galaxies being more common in early-
and late-type spirals than in S0s galaxies We found that larger bars are located
in larger galaxies indicating the interplay between the bar and disk components
No dierence between the local galaxy density of barred and non-barred galaxies
was found in addition neither the length nor strength of the bars are correlated
with the local environment These results suggest that local environment does
not play an important role in bar formation and evolution A statistical signi-
cant dierence between the central light concentration of barred and non-barred
galaxies was found The former were located in less concentrated galaxies This
dierence could explain the lower fraction and the weakness of bars detected in
S0 galaxies in comparison with the other types
