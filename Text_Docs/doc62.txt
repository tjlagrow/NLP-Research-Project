We present a new approach to nicotinic receptor kinetics and a new model explaining random
variabilities in the duration of open events The model gives new interpretation on brief and long
receptor openings and predicts for two identical binding sites the presence of three components in
the open time distribution two brief and a long We also present the physical model of the receptor
block This picture naturally and universally explains receptor desensitization the phenomenon of
central importance in cellular signaling The model is based on single-channel experiments con-
cerning the eects of hydrocortisone HC on the kinetics of control wild-type WT and mutated
D200Q mouse nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs expressed in HEK 293 cells The ap-
pendix contains an original result from probability renewal theory a derivation of the probability
distribution function for the duration of a process performed by two independent servers
INTRODUCTION
A generally accepted kinetic model GAKM of ACh
receptor gating assumes that the receptor opens when
one or two agonist molecules get bound to it and shuts
before agonists dissociation reviewed by Hille 2001
If only one molecule is bound to the receptor it opens
for a short time two bound molecules result in a long
opening of the receptor It was however noted that an
excess of brief openings that appeared in some recordings
at high agonist concentrations is not consistent with this
interpretation Colquchoun et al 1985 Sine et al 1987
 Hallermann et al 2005 Thus the question of how the
binding sites contribute to channel gating is still open
The GAKM assumes that the ACh-AChR binding is
formed as a result of the interaction between the -
electron systems originating from the agonist-binding-
sites-aromatic-amino-acids and the cholinum nitrogen
native to the quaternary ammonium ligands reviewed
by Arias 2000What is usually not discussed is the
fact that close to the ACh binding site there is an elec-
trically noneutral amino acid the negatively charged as-
partic acid which may have some inuence on the ago-
nist binding or tracking To check the role of this amino
acid for the ACh receptors kinetics we performed exper-
iments on the D200Q receptor Mukhtasimova et al
2005 with the negatively charged aspartic acid removed
and replaced by a polar amino acid glutamine Previ-
ous studies suggested that the amino acid D200 played
a role in the process of receptor activation ie in the pro-
cess that starts after a binding of the agonist OLeary
et al 1992 Akk et al 1996 In our present studies we
go a bit further we examine the role of this amino acid
in the process of the receptor block

We studied the receptors kinetics in both wild and
mutated versions to better understand the limits of the
validity of the GAKM discussed above This model has
very severe consequences for our understanding of the
structure of the receptor Applications of various block-
ers such as the open-channel blockers and the use of
GAKM predicts for example the amino acid content of
an ion channel Leonard et al 1988 Validity of the
models describing how the receptor is built is thus very
strongly dependent on the model of the receptors kinet-
The classical open-channel blockers theory is based
on the observation that the voltage dependence in the
blockers action occurs only when the blockers are elec-
trically charged Neher et al 1978 Akk et al 2003 It
turns out however that there exist electrically neutral
molecules such as HC Bouzat et al 1996 Nurowska
et al 2002 and physostigmine Wachtel 1993 which
block the ACh receptor with a very strong voltage depen-
dence They prove that the voltage dependency is quite
a complex phenomenon which is not only a consequence
of the molecule charge
Another doubt about the GAKM comes from the fact
that the open-channel blockers action is very often de-
pendent on the agonist concentration The occurrence
of this dependence is so common that some authors con-
sider it as the main feature of the open-channel blockers
Buisson et al 1998 This is in direct contradiction with
the claim of the open-channel blockers theory that the
blocker enters into the ionic channel once the blocker
is in the channel the agonist concentration should not
inuence the block
In this paper we introduce a model of the receptor
blocking which resolves the problems discussed above
Our model explains how an electrically neutral blocker
HC induces a voltage dependent eect
It also ex-
plains the dependence of the blocker action on the ago-
nist concentration This model naturally and universally
explains receptor desensitization Molecular rearrange-
ments causing receptor desensitization were up to now
poorly understood Our model of the receptor block re-
quires a new kinetic model of the AChR gating The
formulation of this new kinetic model is also given and
its consequences for the kinetic theory are discussed
II METHODS
Cell culture The human kidney cell line HEK 293 was
routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with heat-
inactivated foetal calf serum 10 L-glutamine 4mM
penicillin 100 unitsml1 and streptomycin 100 g
ml1 Cells were incubated in an atmosphere containing
5 CO2 at 37 C One day before transfection cells were
seeded into culture dishes
Transfection Mouse nAChR subunit     cD-
NAs in the expression vector pRBG4 Sine 1994 and the
mito-GFP construct were transiently expressed in HEK
293 cells using LipofectAmine Plus TM Reagent Life

-subunit with the D200 aspartic acid to Q glutamine
substitution were the generous gift of Prof Steven Sine

Ltd 50-500 nM ACh in experiments with the WT re-
ceptor and 10-100 M ACh in experiments with D200Q
receptor HC Sigma-Aldrich Co Ltd 002-1 mM was in-
corporated in the pipette solution by dissolving it in NES
Loftsson et al 2003 the suspension of HC was heated
35 C for about 4 hours and left under constant agita-
tion for another 24 h at room temperature
If not otherwise stated results represent experiments
performed at 60 mV of pipette potential
Data Analysis ACh-induced currents were recorded us-
ing an Axopatch 200B Axon Instruments Foster City
CA USA The signals were ltered 2-3 kHz -3dB and
transferred at 50 kHz using the Digidata 1200 inter-
face Axon Instruments to a hard disc Single currents
were analyzed using the pClamp 7 software Axon In-
struments Transitions were detected using a threshold-
crossing algorithm with a threshold for the open and the
closed states set at about 50 of the mean channel cur-
rent level Only recordings with rarely overlapping open-
ings were analysed and only openings to the rst level
were included in the dwell-time distributions In case of
stable patches after performing recordings at dierent
membrane potentials we performed the second registra-
tion at 60 mV of pipette potential starting about 15-
20 min after the patch formation The receptor kinetics
recorded at 60 mV immediately after the patch forma-
tion and after 15 min were compared We did not observe
any signicant changes neither in time constants nor in
current amplitude
In most of experiments the dwell-
time distributions were constructed from more than 1000
events however in few cases from more than 300 events
Open and blocked time constants open and blocked of
the open and closed time distributions were tted by the
method of maximum likelihood using the PSTAT pro-
gram pClamp7 with a probability density function be-
ing the sum of n exponential terms ie
exp t
ncid88
where ai represents the area of the i-th component The
open time distribution of the WT receptor was tted
with 2 components n  2 open corresponds to the
long component of the open time distribution The open
time distribution of the mutant D200Q receptor was
tted with 1 component only n  1 blocked corre-
sponds to the component that is present in the closed
time distribution of the blocked receptor only and such
its area increases with HC concentration It should be
also mentioned that due to the resolution of our single
channel recording 0110 -0180 ms very brief events
were probably undetected This however should not af-
fect the estimation of the duration of the blocked events
blocked They appear only within the bursts having at
least two openings It was shown previously Nurowska
et al 2002 that in such bursts brief openings are absent
Since brief openings exist only as isolated openings they
can not aect the closed periods within a burst
Statistical analysis Data are given as mean  SEM
The unpaired Students t-test was used to determine the
statistical signicance

III RESULTS
The inclusion of ACh in the patch pipette induced
single-channel currents in both types of cells expressing
WT receptors or mutated D200Q nACh receptors Fig
1 However the activity of the D200Q receptor was
visible only when the ACh concentration was approach-
ing micromoles Below this concentration of ACh the
activity of the D200Q receptor was negligible For this
reason in experiments with the D200Q receptor we in-
creased the agonist concentration up to 10-100 M This
activated the receptor but contrary to the standard be-
haviour of the receptor in high concentration of ACh
did not cause receptor desensitization Fig 1A Actu-
ally only one component was present in the closed time
distributions which time constant decreased with the ag-
onist concentration increase A second component in the
closed time distribution appeared only after adding the
hormone
The single-channel I-V relationship gave a slope con-
ductance of 334  08 pS n  9 for the WT receptor
and 320  08 pS n  17 for the D200Q receptor sug-
gesting similar pore conductance properties The mean
open-channel lifetime ie the mean time constant of the
main component open of the WT receptor was 690 
078 ms 50-500 nM ACh and did not depend on ago-
nist concentration The open of the D200Q receptor
increased with the agonist concentration increase being
081  022 ms for 10 M ACh and 157  046 ms for
100 M ACh P  00001 two-tailed t-test Even so
open of the mutated receptor was signicantly smaller
than open of the WT receptor in the presence of 50-
500 nM ACh P  0001 two-tailed t-test Fig 1B
The voltage-dependency of open for the mutated recep-
tor was nevertheless maintained Fig1B
In the presence of 1 mM HC in the patch pipette there
was no signicant eect on the single-channel I-V slope
conductance which was 320  05 pS n  10 for the
WT receptor and 316  05 pS n  12 for the D200Q
receptor In both types of cells HC decreased open in a
concentration-dependent manner Fig 2 and produced
a characteristic burst-opening eect When HC blocked
the WT receptor open did not change with change of the
patch membrane potential or changed very weakly Fig
3 However when HC blocked the mutated receptor
open increased with increasing membrane hyperpolariza-
tion Fig 3 Interestingly the blocked events induced
by HC were voltage-dependent in the WT receptor but
we did not notice any obvious voltage-dependency of the
mean time constants of the blocked events blocked in
the mutated receptor Fig 4 For all HC concentra-
tions blocked of the D200Q receptor were signicantly
shorter than blocked of the WT receptor Fig 5A P 
0001 This decrease in the blocked for the mutated re-
ceptor was not induced by the high agonist concentration
since our experiments with dierent agonist concentra-
tions and the D200Q receptor excluded this possibility
Fig 5B In both types of receptors blocked depended
on the HC concentration Fig 5A
to the direction blocked  open with a kinetic constant
equal to kHC
Here k denotes the dissociation constant of the
blocker It follows that the passage B1  open presented
by this scheme is not connected with the dissociation of
the blocker the blocker dissociates when passing from
B2 to B1 thus the state B1 is a state without a bound
blocker
sponding to the passage blocked  open given by
The complex scheme 1 has a kinetic constant corre-
kopen  a  kHC
1  kHC
Note that formula 2 becomes a  kHC in the limit
k  kHC This limit corresponds to the situation
when the state B2 is very much shorter in the dwell-time
than the state B1
A consequence of the postulated kinetic model de-
scribed by scheme 1 is that state B1 is very particular
the receptor leaves state B1 with the same frequency a
independently of the presence of the blocker Only after
leaving this state the receptor decides to pass to pre-
cisely one of the two possible states open and B2 Thus
the two states open and B2 which can not be occupied
simultaneously originate from the same event the aban-
donment of state B1 by the receptor This means that the
rough scheme 1 describing the kinetics of the receptor
is more precisely represented by
IV DISCUSSION
The main conclusion of our experiments is that 1block
decreases linearly with the HC concentration growth
Fig 5A This means that the kinetic constant describ-
ing the passage from a blocked to an open state is given
by a  kHC where a and k are HC-independent con-
stants We thus have
akHC block
This suggests that the state blocked is a complex state
consisting of two substates B1 and B2 between which
there exists a passage B1  B2 in the direction opposite
We further postulate that the state B1 is unliganded
This in particular means that the opening of the recep-
tor B1  open is caused by a binding of the agonist to
the binding activating site It also means that in an
open receptor the agonist is not permanently attached
to the binding site It switches between the state when
it is bound the states when it is o the binding site
again the state in which it is bound and so on The ex-
istence of two binding sites prevents the receptor from
being shut
in moments when the agonist leaves one
binding site the receptor will still be in an open state
provided that another agonist molecule is bound in the
second binding site The same is true when the second
agonist molecule leaves the binding site as only when
the rst agonist molecule is bound will the receptor be
B1openB2a-kHCkHCk-B1openB2a-kHCkHCk-aopened We assume that after leaving the binding site
the agonist eventually comes back due to the attractive
electric force associated with the negative charge of the
close-to-the-binding-site-amino acid D200 This assump-
tion was conrmed by our experiments we performed a
series of experiments with a mutated D200Q receptor
in which the amino acid D200 was replaced by a polar
amino acid Q with much smaller negative charge As
we expected in such a mutated receptor the openings
were much shorter than the openings of the wild type
receptor Fig 1B
These considerations enable us to formulate the follow-
ing oscillating model of the receptor opening
 The receptor has two sites say A and B at which
the agonist also called the activator can be bound
It opens immediately after one molecule of the ac-
tivator is bound to A or B and stays open as long
as at least one of the binding sites A or B is occu-
pied The activators dissociate from A and B after
some time tA and tB respectively These times
have the same exponential probability distribution
with parameter   0
 Let us assume that the receptor opens because of
an agonist binding at A Then the agonist stays
bound to the receptor at A for time tA We also
assume that the second binding site binds the sec-
ond agonists molecule after some time which de-
pends on agonist concentration say  measured
from the moment of the opening of the receptor 
is a random variable which if it is greater than tA
the opening time of the receptor is simply tA
 If   tA the receptor is still opened but now with
both A and B occupied In such situation each of
the two agonists may dissociate independently af-
ter the respective times tA and tB Each of them
returns to its binding site after time tx provided
that the other agonist is still bound The time tx is
a random variable having the exponential distribu-
tion with the parameter   0 which is the same
for both agonist molecules
 The situation in which the molecules from A and
B leave and return from and to their binding sites
repeats until the moment in which both binding
sites are empty In such situation the receptor shuts
The above assumptions about the receptors kinetics
suce to derive an explicit formula for the probability
Popentime  t of the receptors open time This orig-
inal derivation is given in the Appendix
Assuming that the shift time  is a random variable
with probability distribution F x not depending on tA
tB and  and denoting opentime we obtain the for-
mula for P  t given in the Theorem 1 in the Ap-
pendix expression 7
We emphasize that the analytic expression 7 for the
open time distribution is in total agreement with Monte
Carlo simulations of the open time assuming that the
receptor obeys the proposed model and has the shift time
distribution F x  1  ex see Fig6
The formula 7 is a superposition of three exponen-
tial functions The rst one which has the time constant
-1s1 we attribute to the distribution of long openings
The brief openings consist of two closely spaced compo-
nents with the corresponding time constants equal to -
1s2 and 1  Note that neither of them has a time
constant equal to the mean time a single agonist molecule
stays in the activating site contrary to what is often as-
sumed for brief openings Note also that three compo-
nents in the open time distribution were already observed
in high resolution Hallermann et al 2005 Parzefall et
al 1998 and classical Hatton et al 2003 single chan-
nel recordings The formula 7 tted by the minimum
2 method was in perfect agreement with the open time
distributions measured for WT and D200Q receptors
in all 38 recordings Examples of the comparison of the
theoretical distribution 7 with experimentally obtained
distributions of the open events for both receptors are
shown on Fig6 The mean values of the tting param-
eters  and  did not depend on agonist concentration
and were   103019 ms1   19046 ms1 for
the WT receptor n  17 and   135011 ms1 
 330076 ms1 for the D200Q receptor n  21
Similar values of the  parameter suggest that the times
the agonist stays in the activating site tA and tB are
not aected by the presence of the amino acid D How-
ever since the  parameter obtained for the WT receptor
diers signicantly P 00001 from the same param-
eter obtained for the mutated receptor we suggest that
when closed to the activating site the agonist stays in
the electric eld of the amino acid D This refers to the
open receptor Mean parameters  obtained for both
receptors do not dier signicantly for the WT recep-
tor   364120 ms1 and for the D200Q receptor
  164047 ms1 despite the dierent agonist con-
centration used in the experiments Thus  parameter
depends not only on the agonist concentration but also
on the presence of the amino acid D
We now pass to the discussion of the receptorss block-
ing mechanism
We assume that the unblocked receptor acts according
to the kinetic model presented above This model admits
a shortening of the opening time in the situation when
one of the binding sites is unoccupied In such situation
the returning-to-its-binding-site-agonist may encounter a
molecule that blocks its entrance to the site without re-
ally binding to this site resulting in turn in the closure
of the receptor We postulate that the molecule respon-
sible for such a block is HC
To present the detailed blocking mechanism we rst
explain what happens in the blocked receptor with the
agonist molecules which activated it The observed ex-
istence of bursts suggests that these molecules do not
return to the extracellular solution Indeed if the recep-
tor in the B1 state was activated by binding the agonist
molecules from the extracellular solution then blocked
would decrease with the agonist concentration Since this
is not observed Fig 5B we conclude that the agonist
needed for the transition B1  open comes from the re-
gion which is not accessible to other molecules of the acti-
vator Since it is widely accepted Miyazawa et al 1999
that the receptors activating sites are located in cavities
accessed through narrow tunnels we conclude that even
after the dissociation the activating molecules remain in
their tunnel-cavities Since these cavities are of the cor-
rect size and shape to accommodate one ACh molecule
Miyazawa et al 1999 no other agonist molecule could
bind to its binding site until the ACh molecule leaves the
tunnel-cavity Note that the agonist staying in the cavity-
tunnel experiences the electrostatic repulsion from other
agonist molecules trying to enter the tunnel It forces the
agonist to stay at the bottom of the tunnel If the ago-
nist binding site is not located there then blocked should
increase with the ACh concentration Such a behavior
of blocked was observed in our experiments with receptor
D200Q P 0001 Fig 5B We thus postulate that
the agonist binding site is situated in another place than
the end of the tunnel Fig 7
The main dierence between state B1 and the closed
state is that in state B1 both tunnels associated with the
activating sites are occupied by the corresponding ago-
nist molecules which at every moment may be bound to
the activating sites recall that state B1 is a state with-
out a blocker Surprisingly state B1 without a bound
blocker lasts longer than the blocked state B2 This is
again caused by the repulsive action of the outside ago-
nists molecules which are close to the entrance to the tun-
nel They prevent the agonist in the tunnel from reaching
the binding site Since these molecules are not present
at the entrance to the tunnel all of the time there are
moments when the entrance to the tunnel is free This
occurs with frequency a At such moments the agonist
within the tunnel can approach the entrance and bind to
the site opening the receptor again Moments when the
entrance to the tunnel is not occupied by the outside ag-
onist molecules can be also used by the blocker to enter
the tunnel The blocker as electrically neutral does not
feel the repulsive potential of the agonist within the tun-
nel Entering the tunnel it can freely penetrate it up to
the agonist binding site Once there it prevents the in-
side agonist from binding Note that the presence of the
blocker does not decrease the duration of the B1 state
the blocker has a chance to enter the tunnel only when an
agonist may return to the binding site thus only when
the receptor leaves state B1 This agrees with scheme
Since external molecules repulse the inside tunnel-
cavity agonist from the activating site it is clear that
block is longer in a receptor in which the entrance to the
tunnel is more frequently occupied by the agonist The
measured blocked Fig 5A indicates that such situation
occurs in the WT receptor despite of the lower concen-
tration of the agonist which thus must have agonists
molecules at the entrance to the tunnel more often than
the D200Q receptor We believe that the reason for
this dierence is the negative charge of the amino acid
D200 which most probably attracts positively charged
molecules of the activator towards the entrance of the
tunnel in the WT receptor This also explains why the
probability of the opening of the WT receptor is higher
than the probability of the opening of the D200Q re-
ceptor
This justies our next postulate that the location of
amino acid 200 is dierent in an open and a closed re-
ceptor
if the receptor is open the location of amino
acid 200 is close to the activating site inside the cavity-
tunnel if the receptor is closed 200 is located outside
the cavity-tunnel but still close to its entrance
Summing up it is the HC molecule that initiates the
blockage of the receptor At the initial stage of the block
ACh molecules do not act as blockers since the open
receptor does not attract them from the extracellular re-
gion toward the tunnel-cavity where the block occurs
Once the receptor is in the blocked state the situation
changes the closed receptor exposes the negative charge
to the outside of the tunnel starting the process of at-
tracting the extracellular molecules towards the tunnel-
cavity Thus in the process of blocking both ACh and
HC participate On the one hand the ACh molecule lo-
cated at the entrance to the tunnel-cavity repulses the
agonist trapped in the tunnel from the activating site
on the other hand the HC molecule when the tunnel en-
trance is empty enters into it preventing other molecules
from reaching the activating site If the location of the
amino acid D was changing with the membrane poten-
tial then the action of HC would be unaected HC is
an uncharged molecule But it would alter the action
of ACh We postulate that the amino acid D location is
voltage dependent This implies the voltage dependency
of block in the WT receptor In D200Q the situation
is dierent The frequency of the ACh approaches to
the tunnel cavity mainly depends on the ACh concentra-
tion and not on the attraction of the amino acid 200
which in the case of the amino acid Q is weak Thus in
the mutated receptor blocked has no signicant voltage
dependence Fig 4
Finally we emphasize that although the state B1 is
very peculiar we believe that it occurs very commonly
For this state to exist the blocker is not needed It is a
closed state which diers from the usual closed state
by the presence of unbound agonist molecules in the
tunnel-cavities in both subunits If such a state randomly
emerges eg in high concentration of the agonist then
if the agonist concentration remains high exiting from
this state would be very dicult the highly concentrated
activator molecules will be present at the entrance to the
tunnel-cavity repulsing the agonist from the binding site
We associate our state B1 with a particular closed state
of the receptor which is reported to be observed only in
high agonist concentration and to be characterized by a
very long duration Thus state B1 corresponds to the
desensitization of the receptor That in the process of
this desensitization amino acid D200 plays a role is con-
rmed by our experiments in which such desensitization
was not present in the receptor D200Q even if we went
to agonists concentration as high as 01 mM
Experiments with other blockers and D200 mutants
are needed to conrm the role of D200 amino acid in
mechanisms of the receptor block and desensitization A
presence of charged amino acids close to the agonist bind-
ing pockets may be in this family of receptors shared by
the nicotinic the GABAA and the 5-HT3 receptors the
common feature Schreiter et al 2003 Hartvig et al
2000 making the proposed model of the receptor desen-
sitization universal for other ligand-gated ion channels

Let us consider a system formed by two identical
servers say A and B  working independently and let
1 2 stand for the time of their trouble-free operation
It is supposed that Pi  t  et   0 t  0 i 
1 2 At the initial time t  0 both servers are in working
condition and say server A starts to work The second
server starts to work with some delay   0 having a

breakdown of any server its repairing starts immediately
and it lasts 1 2 time-unites respectively It is supposed
that Pi  t  et   0 t  0i  1 2 After the
repair is nished the server starts to work again The
above mentioned random variables are all supposed to
be independent
The breakdown of the whole system occurs if both
servers are not in working conditions ie they are being
repaired
