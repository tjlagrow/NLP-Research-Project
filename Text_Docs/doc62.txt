High frequency dispersion does not alter the low frequency
spectrum of Hawking radiation from a single black hole hori-
zon whether the dispersion entails subluminal or superlumi-
nal group velocities We show here that in the presence of
an inner horizon as well as an outer horizon the superlumi-
nal case diers dramatically however The negative energy
partners of Hawking quanta return to the outer horizon and
stimulate more Hawking radiation if the eld is bosonic or
suppress it if the eld is fermionic This process leads to
exponential growth or damping of the radiated ux and cor-
relations among the quanta emitted at dierent times unlike
in the usual Hawking eect These phenomena may be ob-
servable in condensed matter black hole analogs that exhibit
superluminal dispersion

I INTRODUCTION
Recent work has shown that Hawking radiation is
highly insensitive to modications of the short distance
physics of the quantum eld In these models linear elds
are considered and the eld equation is modied at high
wavevectors in some preferred frame yielding a nonlinear
dispersion relation k relating frequency to wavevector
Models with both subluminal 13 and superluminal 45
group velocities at high wavevectors have been studied
including lattice black hole spacetimes 6 which have
subluminal dispersion The picture that emerges from
these studies is that the thermal Hawking spectrum is
very robust for black holes with temperature much less
than the energy scale of the new physics Although the
short distance physics does modify this spectrum the
modications are so slight at the frequencies of interest
that they seem well nigh impossible to observe
We have found a dramatic exception to this rule how-
ever If there is both an outer and an inner horizon and if
the dispersion is superluminal then the Hawking process
for a bosonic eld is self-amplifying and the radiated ux
grows exponentially in time while for a fermionic eld
the process is self-attenuating What happens is that

the negative energy partner of a Hawking particle af-
ter falling to the inner horizon bounces and returns
to the outer horizon on a superluminal trajectory where
it either stimulates or suppresses more Hawking radia-
tion in the bosonic or fermionic case respectively This
secondary radiation is not only dierent than the usual
Hawking ux but it is correlated to the prior radiation
In the bosonic case the process continues to amplify at
least until the back reaction becomes important
Charged black holes have inner horizons but astro-
physical ones would loose their charge very rapidly so it
is dicult to imagine how this runaway Hawking eect
could ever be observed for real black holes Even so it
provides an interesting theoretical laboratory in which to
explore the eects of short distance physics Moreover
it is conceivably relevant to string theory and it might
be observable in a condensed matter analogue of a black
hole Let us briey indicate these ideas in turn
In spite of many points of close agreement between
the physics of near extremal D-branes and black holes a
glaring discrepancy persists If a radiating near extremal
D-brane state is maintained at xed energy by a constant
inux of energy in a pure state then the entropy in the
radiation will be constant and there will be correlations in
the radiation that emerges at dierent times For a black
hole on the other hand the usual Hawking process leads
to uncorrelated thermal radiation for all time The eects
of superluminal dispersion invalidate the usual Hawking
picture because the negative energy partners return to
the event horizon If there is something analogous to the
superluminal dispersion of our model in string theory
then perhaps that could eliminate the discrepancy be-
tween the string and black hole pictures This may not
be so far-fetched String theory is after all non-local
in some sense and there is some evidence 7 suggesting
that it supports superluminal eects
A condensed matter analogUnruhs sonic black hole
819was the original stimulus for the development of
the dispersive models In this model a sonic horizon oc-
curs where the ow velocity of an inhomogeneous uid
exceeds the speed of sound Although it seems unlikely
that this situation can be experimentally realized for a
low temperature superuid there are variations of the
idea that might be realizable involving quasiparticles
other than phonons in dierent systems For example
this may occur for fermion quasiparticles in rotating su-
peruid vortex cores with gap nodes such as 3He-A or
d-wave superconductors 10 or in moving 3He-A tex-
tures 11 In both these examples there are both inner
and outer horizons Moreover the quasiparticle disper-
sion relation is relativistic suciently near a gap node
and the group velocity increases ie becomes super-
luminal as the dierence between the momentum and
the gap node increases so the eective eld theory has
superluminal dispersion Thus it is not inconceivable
that the phenomena discussed here may someday be ob-
servable
This paper is organized as follows
In section II
the superluminal dispersion model for both bosons and
fermions is discussed The propagation of wavepackets in
the black hole spacetime with inner and outer horizons is
analyzed qualitatively in section III and the implications
for the amplication or suppression and the correlations
in the Hawking radiation are drawn in section IV Section
V renders the previous discussion quantitative by using
explicit wavepacket solutions derived in the appendix
to nd expressions for the number and correlations be-
tween the radiated quanta Open issues concerning the
boundary conditions on the quantum state and the grav-
itational back reaction are discussed briey in section VI
We use units with h  c  1 and metric signature

II SUPERLUMINAL DISPERSION MODEL
A 2-dimensional model suces to illustrate the essen-
tial physics We assume the spacetime metric is static
and therefore 12 coordinates can be chosen at least lo-
cally so that the line element takes the form
ds2  dt2 cid0dx  vxdtcid12
A special case is the line element of the t  r sub-
space of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole space-
time in Painleve-Gullstrand coordinates where vr 
p2GMr  Q2r2 These coordinates cover the black
hole interior down to where vr  0 at r  Q22GM 
More generally we consider any vx which is negative
vanishes as x   and is greater than 1 except be-
tween inner and outer horizons located at xi and xo
where vxio  1
A Boson eld
We adopt a linear eld theory with higher spatial
derivatives included in the action in order to provide a
superluminal dispersion relation In this section we re-
strict to the case of a real bosonic eld The case of a
Majorana fermion eld will be discussed in section II B
The action for the eld is given by
2Z d2xcid20cid16t  vxcid172
 bF xcid21 
In the ordinary relativistic action one has bF x  2
In this paper we take
bF x  2
To motivate this action we note that the black hole de-
nes a preferred frame the frame of freely falling ob-
servers
In the Painleve-Gullstrand coordinate system
t  vx is the unit tangent to free fall world lines that
start from rest at innity and x is its unit outward
pointing normal Our action comes from modifying the
derivative operator only along the unit normal x by the
addition of higher derivative terms which become impor-
tant only when the wavelength is of order 1k0 or shorter
We will assume that this length scale of new physics
is much shorter than the length scale of the metric 21
ie k0  vv
In particular we assume k0  
where   vxio is the surface gravity of the horizon
The idea is that the microstructure of spacetime or of a
condensed matter analog might give rise to such higher
derivative terms in the eective action The choice 23
is just the generic form for the lowest order such term that
is reection invariant and produces superluminal group
velocities
The action 2223 produces the equation of motion
t  xvt  vx  2
x 
To derive the dispersion relation for this equation we look
for solutions of the form
t x  expcid18it  iZ x
kx dxcid19
where kx is a position dependent wavevector Substi-
tuting this ansatz into the equation of motion 24 and
neglecting derivatives of vx and kx results in the dis-
persion relation
  vk2  F 2k
F 2k  k2  k4k2
The group velocity in the free-fall frame is dFdk so
wavepackets with k  k0 propagate near the speed of
light whereas wavepackets with k 
 k0 propagate super-
luminally
The dispersion relation 26 is a fourth order polyno-
mial equation in the wavevector k so it has four solu-
tions for k at given values of  and v The nature of
these roots is revealed by a graphical method
In g-
ure 1 we plot the straight line   vk for one value
of  satisfying 0    k0 and two values of v and
We dene F k
the curve F k as functions of k
as the positive square root of 27 The intersection
points are the allowed real wavevector roots to the dis-
persion relation When v  1 there are only two real
roots corresponding to the two roots for the ordinary
dispersion relation with Fordk  k the other two
being complex The positive wavevector is denoted ks
When v 
2 k023  1 on the other hand all
four roots are real with one positive and three nega-
tive The positive wavevector is denoted k in this case
and in decreasing magnitude the negative wavevectors
are denoted k and ks respectively the other negative
wavevector corresponds to an ingoing wave that plays no
role in this paper so we do not give it a name These
roots are labeled in gure 1
 1  3
FIG 1 Plot of  vk for one value of  and two values
of v and F k as functions of k The intersection points of
the curves are the allowed wavevector roots of the dispersion
relation 26
The dispersion relation plot in gure 1 is also quite
convenient for tracing the motion of wavepackets in the
background spacetime The coordinate group velocity
vg  dxdt of a wavepacket centered on a given wavevec-
tor is given by
 v 
where dFdk is the group velocity in the free-fall frame
Thus at any wavevector vg is just the slope of the F k
curve minus the slope of the straight line   vk
For all four types of wavevectors ks of interest to us
dFdk is positive hence the sign of vg is determined by
which of the two slopes is larger something that is easily
read from the gure For   0 the group velocity for
ks and k is positive whereas for ks it is negative
When generalized to a complex scalar eld the action
22 is invariant under constant phase transformations
of the eld This implies the existence of a conserved
current j The integral of the time component j0 over
a spatial slice serves as a conserved inner product when
evaluated on complex solutions to the equation of motion
24 For the metric 21 this inner product takes the
f g  iZ dxcid16f t  vxg  gt  vxf cid17 29
where f t x and gt x are solutions to 24
Two classes of complex solutions to the eld equation
24 are of special interest for quantization The rst are
the positive free fall frequency wavepackets They can be
written as sums of solutions satisfying
t  vxf t x  if t x
where   0 The second are the positive Killing fre-
quency wavepackets These are sums of solutions of the
form eitx where   0 A positive free fall fre-
quency wavepacket conned to a constant vx interval
at one time necessarily has a positive norm under 29
as does a positive Killing frequency wavepacket conned
to a region where vx  0 where Killing frequency co-
incides with free-fall frequency Since the norm is con-
served it is positive at all times if it is at one time even
when the wavepacket does not remain in an interval of
constant or vanishing vx Note that if the wavelength is
small compared to the scale of variations of vx then a
positive free-fall frequency wavepacket will have positive
norm even if vx is not constant
To quantize the eld we assume that bt x is a self-
adjoint operator solution to the eld equation that sat-
ises the canonical commutation relations We dene
the annihilation operator af  associated to a normal-
ized complex solution to the wave equation f t x by
af   fb
The commutation relations for the eld operator are
equivalent to the relations
af  ag  f g
If f t x is a positive norm solution
for all f and g
then af  behaves as an annihilation operator If f t x
is a negative norm solution f t x has positive norm
so af   af  behaves as a creation operator
B Fermion eld
For simplicity we consider two-dimensional massless
Majorana fermions Following the conventions of 13
the action in a general curved spacetime is given by1
1In higher dimensions there would be a spin connection term
as well In two-dimensions it is easy to show that this term
vanishes identically

and expanding the action in the metric 21 using the

cid0t  1  vxcid1cid17
In this form it is clear that  and  do not mix Fur-
thermore at innity where vx  0  is right-moving
while  is left-moving We therefore drop  in the
remainder as it plays no role in the Hawking radiation
calculation
Following the same motivation described in section II
we now modify the action for  by subtracting the
higher derivative term k2
x obtaining the action
0 3
Varying with respect to  results in the equation of
2Z d2xcid0t  1  vx  k2
cid16t  vx  xv2  x  k2
xcid17  0
xcid1  217
Substituting t x  expit  iR x kxdx into
the equation of motion and dropping derivatives of kx
and vx results in the dispersion relation
  vk  k  k3k2
This is the same up to the coecient of the k3 term
and higher order terms as the branch of the scalar eld
dispersion relation corresponding to positive group ve-
locity in the free-fall frame given in 26 and displayed
in gure 1 The classication of scalar wavepacket types
in section II A therefore applies to fermion wavepackets
as well In particular the higher derivative term leads to
superluminal propagation at large wavevectors
a self-adjoint operator solution to the eld equation
that satises the canonical anti-commutation relations
To quantize the eld we assume that bt x is
bt xbt x  x x The conserved inner
product is the integral of the time component of the con-
served current associated with phase invariance of the ac-
tion 217 generalized to complex fermions and takes
the form
We dene the annihilation operator bf  associated to a
normalized complex solution to the wave equation f t x
bf   hfbi
The anti-commutation relations for the eld operator are
then equivalent to the relations
bf  bg  hf gi
for all f and g We represent the operators bf  on the
fermionic Fock space generated by positive free-fall fre-
quency solutions to the equation of motion 218
f t x is a positive free-fall frequency solution then bf 
behaves as an annihilation operator on this space
f t x is a negative free-fall frequency solution then
f t x has positive free-fall frequency so bf   bf 
behaves as a creation operator
III WAVEPACKET PROPAGATION
 k0 it is because the
In this section we give a qualitative analysis of the
role of the inner horizon in modifying the Hawking radi-
ation This analysis will exploit a WKB description of
wavepacket propagation allowing for non-WKB mode
conversion in the vicinity of the horizons The anal-
ysis applies equally well for the bosonic and fermionic
quantum elds Scattering of waves on account of the
background curvature of the metric 21 is negligible as
long as the radius of curvature is much greater than 1k0
For small wavevectors k  k0 this is because the wave
equation is approximately conformally invariant and the
metric like any two-dimensional metric is conformally
at For large wavevectors k 
wavelength is much smaller than the radius of curvature
We begin outside the outer horizon with a low fre-
quency outgoing wavepacket peaked around a wavevector
of type ks see gure 1 and we follow this wavepacket
backwards in time A sketch of what we nd is given
in gure 2 The nal wavepacket ie the one we begin
with is labeled s in gure 2 This packet has posi-
tive group velocity and therefore is right-moving as can
be seen from the graph of the dispersion relation Fig
1 Following this packet backward in time it moves
toward the black hole and blueshifts The Killing fre-
quency  is conserved so the increase in the wavevec-
tor can be seen from Fig 1 by increasing the slope of
the straight line while keeping the intercept xed As
the wavevector grows the group velocity increases in the
free-fall frame and so the packet becomes superluminal
and crosses the horizon backward in time becoming a
packet with wavevectors of type k see gure 2
negative wavevector branch because its group velocity
drops to zero at the horizon Indeed the group velocity
goes through zero and becomes negative so the k packet
turns around and propagates back toward the outer hori-
zon as a ks packet still on the negative wavevector
branch In addition some mode conversion from the neg-
ative to the positive wavevector branch of the dispersion
relation occurs at the inner horizon Therefore part of
the k packet does cross the horizon as a ks packet and
is superposed with the ks packet that evolved from the
k packet
The ks packet inside the inner horizon continues
propagating to the left backward in time The ks packet
however returns to the outer horizon near which its
group velocity drops to zero Again partial mode con-
version to the positive wavevector branch occurs so the
ks packet evolves backward in time to a pair of k and
k packets which are heading back to the inner horizon
This is now almost the same situation we started with
since the original ks packet also evolved into a pair of
k and k packets between the horizons although with a
dierent relative weight The analysis given above thus
tells us qualitatively what happens when they reach the
inner horizon namely the same thing as happened be-
fore The general pattern that emerges is shown in gure
We have so far discussed the history of an outgoing ks
wavepacket followed backward in time It is also instruc-
tive to look at the future evolution of a ks wavepacket
in between the horizons since the negative energy part-
ner of a Hawking particle is such a wavepacket This
evolution can be inferred by the same sort of analysis
just given or simply by time and space reversal of that
analysis and is shown in gure 3
FIG 2 Spacetime sketch of the evolution of an outgoing
ks wavepacket backward in time A line end indicates a
wavepacket arising from mode conversion while an unbroken
line indicates that the wavevector evolves continuously on the
dispersion curve
The wavepacket inside the horizon also has a k com-
ponent which is not obvious if we simply follow contin-
uously along the dispersion curve In fact the WKB ap-
proximation breaks down near the horizon and mode
conversion from the positive wavevector to the nega-
tive wavevector negative free-fall frequency branch of
the dispersion relation occurs This is easily shown ana-
lytically and is made plausible by the fact that around
the horizon the straight line of gure 1 nearly coincides
with a large portion of the curved line of the dispersion
curve thus allowing other wavevectors to become mixed
in The dispersion relation allows wavevectors of types
k k and ks in between the horizons however only
the rst two are right moving whereas the last type is
left moving Since our nal wavepacket is by assumption
purely outgoing outside the horizon there can be no ks
component generated here The k and k wavepackets
In this gure a line
are labeled  and  in gure 2
end indicates a wavepacket arising from mode conver-
sion while an unbroken line indicates that the wavevec-
tor evolves continuously on the dispersion curve
The k and k packets propagate backward in time to-
ward the inner horizon where they both undergo partial
mode conversion The group velocity of the k packet re-
mains positive around the inner horizon and therefore it
can cross becoming a ks packet labeled s2 in gure
2 As before though there is also some mode conver-
sion from the positive to the negative wavevector branch
of the dispersion relation and a left-moving ks packet
s2 in gure 2 is generated which propagates backward
in time back toward the outer horizon The k packet
on the other hand cannot cross the inner horizon on the

particle and its partner forward in time A line end indicates a

IV PARTICLE CREATION ORIGIN OF THE
AMPLIFICATION OR SUPPRESSION OF
HAWKING RADIATION
The amount of particle creation in an outgoing posi-
tive frequency wavepacket  is indicated by the expec-
tation value of the number operator N   aa
To determine this expectation value an initial quantum
state must be specied Let us dene an in-Hilbert space
on some spacelike surface as the Fock space generated
by positive free-fall frequency wavepackets on that sur-
face The corresponding ground state is then annihi-
lated by annihilation operators of these wavepackets We
shall suppose the initial state is such a free-fall ground
state associated with a given surface  Decomposing
     into its positive and negative free-fall fre-
quency parts on  the ground state condition implies in
the bosonic case that hN i    and in the
fermionic case hN i  h i
Suppose we choose  as surface 1 in gure 2 ie a
surface that cuts through the k and k packets rst
produced by propagating the ks packet back in time
Then the number expectation value for the ks packet
is just minus the norm of the k packet In 45 this
was shown for bosons to be thermal at the Hawking
temperature for wavepackets with Killing frequencies 
satisfying  
   k0 That is the standard Hawking
eect occurs even in the presence of superluminal disper-
sion if there is only a single horizon
When there is also an inner horizon the particle cre-
ation depends very much on which surface is used to de-
ne the initial ground state
If we impose the ground
state condition on the earlier surface 2 in gure 2 in-
stead of surface 1 the occupation number for the nal
ks packet is no longer thermal The norm of the neg-
ative frequency part of the wavepacket on surface 2 is
determined not just by the nal passage across the outer
horizon but also by the mode conversion processes at the
inner and outer horizons
As the time between the initial ground state and the
nal outgoing wavepacket grows there is an exponential
amplication or suppression in the occupation number
of the nal wavepacket in the boson and fermion cases
respectively To see why note that the ks packet de-
noted s2 in gure 2 evolves into the orthogonal ks and
ks packets denoted s1 and s1 respectively hence the
norms are related by
 s22   s12   s12
where f2 stands for f f  in the bosonic case and hf fi
in the fermionic case
Consider rst the bosonic case A ksks packet
has positive negative free fall frequency and therefore
positive negative norm under 29 so it follows from
41 that  s12 is larger in magnitude than  s22
Continuing into the past this process repeats and for
each bounce between the horizons the norm of the
wavepacket between the horizons grows by some xed
multiple resulting in exponential growth of both sn2
and  sn22 Since the negative frequency part of this
wavepacket determines the number of created particles in
the nal outgoing wavepacket that number will grow ex-
ponentially in the time between the initial surface  and
the emergence of the outgoing wavepacket  Viewed
forward in time the Hawking eect is a self-amplifying
process since the negative energy partners of the Hawk-
ing particles return to the event horizon in the form of
a pair of k and k packets and stimulate the emission
of more radiation and more partners The wavepacket
trajectories associated with this forward in time picture
are shown in gure 3
For a fermionic eld the above discussion is modied
only by the fact that all wavepackets have positive norm
so equation 41 implies that  s12 is smaller in mag-
nitude than   s22 This means that the number of
created particles will be exponentially damped in time
In eect the allowed states between the horizons for the
negative energy partners of the Hawking particles become
lled cutting o further pair creation
One further important point can be extracted from this
analysis Since a single particlepartner wavepacket pair
evolves to a sequence of outgoing wavepackets as shown
in gure 3 the states of all these outgoing wavepackets
will be correlated This can also be seen from the back-
wards in time picture It is clear from gure 2 that suc-
cessive outgoing wavepackets will have past histories that
partly overlap in particular on the initial ground state
surface so there will be correlations between the quanta
emitted from the horizon at dierent times These corre-
lations are in sharp contrast to the usual Hawking eect
which produces uncorrelated thermal radiation The in-
formation loss that is normally associated with the cor-
relations between Hawking quanta and their partners is
largely eliminated since an unending sequence of Hawk-
ing quanta is coherently correlated to the same partner
degrees of freedom
2It is perhaps surprising to have exponential growth in time
when there are no imaginary frequency solutions to the disper-
sion relation 26 There is no contradiction however since
these exponentially growing wavepacket solutions cannot be
Fourier transformed in time so need not be expressible as
superpositions of time-independent mode solutions
V QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS
the previous
The qualitative analysis of
section
will now be sharpened by explicitly constructing the
wavepacket solutions discussed there This will allow us
to quantify the amount of amplication suppression and
correlation of the black hole radiation In the rst two
subsections we treat only the bosonic case and in the
last subsection we discuss the fermionic case
A Wavepacket solutions
The basic idea applied here is to patch together lo-
cal wavepacket solutions with the aid of evolution for-
mulae The derivation of these evolution formulae is
discussed in the Appendix of this paper They are de-
rived using connection formulae for time-independent
mode functions which are obtained by matching WKB
solutions to near-horizon approximations
Forming
wavepackets with the mode functions we then obtain the
evolution formulae for the wavepackets
Evolution formulae are needed for two dierent bound-
ary conditions at both the inner and outer horizons cor-
responding to the spacetime diagrams in gures 4a-d
Using the notation f  g  to denote f evolves to g 
forward in time the evolution formulae about the outer
horizon are
n  n  ns
n  n  n1s
while about the inner horizon they are
ins  ns  n  n
ins  ns  n  n
where all packets have been left unnormalized in order
to keep the formulae as simple as possible The evolu-
tion formulae given here are preferred for evolving pack-
ets backwards in time Following the same techniques
described in the appendix evolution formulae more con-
ducive to evolving wavepackets forward in time can be
derived The  s and s subscripts denote which
type of wavevector the packet is peaked about ns lies
outside the outer horizon while ins and ins both
lie inside the inner horizon The subscript n is a sort
of time variable Translation of n by one unit has the
eect of translating the wavepacket in time by a certain
amount and also distorting the wavepacket Note that
in the evolution formula at the outer horizon 51b n
increases by one unit on the n1s wavepacket The
evolution formulae 51a-d are basically scattering so-
lutions about a black hole event horizon with 51a-b
corresponding to scattering the ns and ns packets
o the outer horizon backward in time see gures 4a and
b respectively and 51c-d corresponding to scattering
the resulting combinations of  and  packets o the in-
ner horizon backward in time as well see gures 4c and
d respectively
FIG 4 Spacetime sketches of the local wavepacket evolu-
tions given by 51a-d respectively
To construct the wavepacket solution with nal data
consisting of a ks packet outside the outer horizon we
start with the local solution 51a gure 4a This
clearly is not a global solution since n do not solve
the equation of motion 24 about the inner horizon
The combination may be replaced by 51c which does
however This results in the evolution formula
ins  ns  ns
The evolution 52 is also not a global solution to
the equation of motion 24 however since ns is not
a solution about the outer horizon Using 51b to
evolve ns about the outer horizon followed by 51d
to evolve the resulting wavepackets n1 and n1
about the inner horizon we obtain an evolution formula
that can be iterated indenitely
in1s  n1s  ns
Beginning with 52 and iterating 53 n  m times
cid18ins 
nmXj1
injs  mscid19  ns
In this manner we can evolve the nal wavepacket packet
back to the spacelike surface where the initial ground
state boundary condition is dened Solutions of the
form 54 correspond to those used in the qualitative
discussion of section III which are depicted in Fig 2
wherein the rst ks packet has been traded for a k
pair using 51b
If the horizons are not suciently widely separated
then intermediate wavepackets that arise between the ini-
tial and nal packets of 54 will overlap with the initial
and nal wavepackets thus complicating the analysis of
particle creation We can avoid such complications by
constructing a dierent solution Setting n equal to m in
52 and subtracting from 54 we obtain
cid18ins 
nmXj1
injsimscid19
cid0ns  mscid1
This solution corresponds to sending nm iks pack-
ets and a pair of iks packets into the inner horizon
and getting a pair of s packets out of the outer horizon
B Particle creation
We can now compute the average number of particles
in the wavepacket3 ns and the correlations between
emitted particles for dierent values of the time index
n To begin with let us evaluate the occupation number
h0N  0s0i of the rst outgoing packet after the ini-
tial state condition is assumed Then the only evolution
formula we need is 51a with n  0 The annihila-
tion operator for a normalized wavepacket f is given by
af   fb 211 Taking the inner product of 51a
with the quantum eld b and using the ground state
conditions
a 00i  0  a

we obtain

just the Planck distribution at the Hawking temperature
TH  2 as was shown previously 45 for a superu-
minal dispersive eld theory in the case that there is just
one horizon It holds for  
We would have obtained a dierent

The phase angles  are dened implicitly in A18
and the norms A30 were used in the last equality of

It is not yet clear to us what is the correct initial
condition on the quantum state of the eld To deter-
mine this would require following the evolution of the
eld state as the black hole or condensed matter black
hole analog forms It does seem however that the con-
ditions a iks0i  0 are likely to hold while the
remaining specication of the state remains to be de-
termined Fortunately these conditions alone suce to
determine the rate of growth of the number of particles
emitted and the correlations between them
In order to nd the number and correlations in the
radiation for n  0 we use the solution 55 We take n 
m  1 so that the intermediate wavepackets that entered
the construction of 55 will not have any support on the
initial surface and we assume the ground state conditions
a iks0i  0  a iks0i
for k  m Taking the inner product of 55 with the
eld operator b and using conditions 510 we obtain
a ns0i s ms ms
a ms0i
ns ns
from which it follows that
h0a ksa ns0i 
ms ms
pks ksns ns h0N  ms0i
h0N  ns0i 
In particular taking k  n we obtain
ms ms
ns ns h0N  ms0i
The norm of ns A30 is given by

where we have used A21 This decreases monotonically
with n except for at most a discrete set of frequencies for
which   2k for some integer k For these
frequencies T1 A21 vanishes so according to A20 the
corresponding mode is a bound state trapped between
the horizons Therefore the particle creation in ns
increases monotonically with n diverging as n   In
particular if the wavepackets are narrowly peaked about
a frequency  513 yields
h0N  ns0i
h0N  ms0i
which grows exponentially with n  m
is given by

which is nonvanishing only to the extent that these
wavepackets are not orthogonal As nm grows the over-
lap of these wavepackets and hence the correlation 517
goes to zero whereas the correlation 516 remains
Finally let us estimate the time between the succes-
sive particle emissions see gure 3 ie the dierence in
times when successive ns packets A22 cross a xed
x coordinate The trajectory of the packets is given ap-
proximately by the condition of stationary phase

and therefore the time t between the nth and n  1th
packets crossing the coordinate x is given approximately

where we have substituted for An using A23 and T3 is
given by A21
Using the results given in the appendix the -
dependence of the phase factors  and  can be
computed Rather than carrying out this calculation
which we can only do explicitly for any particular vx in
some approximation anywaylet us make a rough esti-
mate The interval t is determined by the time it takes
a wavepacket to bounce back and forth between the
horizons If vx  1 is of order unity between the hori-
zons then using the group velocity of the ks and k
waves one nds that this bounce time is of order a the
coordinate distance between the horizons
C Fermionic case
In this section we briey describe the dierences in the
quantitative analysis of the fermion case The derivation
of the wavepacket solutions for fermions parallels that
given for the scalar eld in section V A and yields an
evolution formula very similar to 55 The nal ex-
pression for the average value of the number operator is
identical in form to 513 however the norm Nns now
increases monotonically with n so that the number ex-
pectation value decreases exponentially in n This is to
be expected since unlike the scalar case the conserved
norm hf fi 220 is positive denite The eect of this
crucial dierence is that instead of exponential growth of
Hawking radiation we now get exponential decay
VI DISCUSSION
We left the question of the correct initial condition
unanswered For a condensed matter black hole it should
be straightforward to deduce this by following the state
of the eld as the black hole forms
It seems fairly
clear that the is wavepackets inside the inner horizon
will be in their ground states What is less clear is the
state of the wavepackets  
s between the
horizons For a real black holeif one wants to entertain
the possibility of superluminal dispersionthe same may
be true The is wavepackets inside the inner horizon
arise from ingoing waves that scatter around or through
the central singularity of a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
in the manner discussed in 14 Since the region inside
the inner horizon is static it would seem plausible that
these are in their ground state as well
 and 
Another issue we have not touched is that of the grav-
itational back-reaction to the radiation studied here In
the bosonic case the exponential growth of the number of
negative energy Hawking partners between the horizons
would surely rapidly entail a strong gravitational reac-
tion In the fermionic case the exponential suppression
of radiation leads quickly to a state with no radiation
at all This is hard to reconcile with the usual picture
in which Hawking radiation is a robust consequence of
a general well-behaved state near the horizon One
would expect that although the negative energy states
of the Hawking partners in the ergoregion between the
horizons become lled there is not all that much energy
in these states since the partners at late times are the
same as the partners at earlier times due to the bounce
between the horizons so the back-reaction should be lim-
ited If so then why doesnt the Hawking radiation con-
tinue The answer it would seem is that although the
state is reasonably well-behaved in terms of energy den-
sity it has peculiar features in just those modes relevant
to the Hawking eect

APPENDIX WAVEPACKET SOLUTIONS
where the approximate WKB wavevectors are given by
In this appendix we explain how the evolution formulae
51a-d for wavepacket solutions are derived with the
help of the results of 5 We treat only the bosonic case
although the fermionic case is essentially identical
The wavepacket evolution formulae are inferred from
connection formulae for mode solutions to the eld equa-
tion 24 of the form
ut x  eitx 
where x  satises the ordinary dierential equation
 ivx1  v2xx  2vxi  vxx
ii  vxx  0
In 5 such solutions were constructed for a black hole
spacetime with a single horizon The basic technique
used was to nd approximate solutions to A2 using
the WKB approximation away from the horizon and to
match these solutions across the horizon by comparing
to the near horizon solution obtained by the method of
Laplace transforms
1 Outer horizon connection formulae
Assuming that the horizon is located at x  0 and
that the metric in the vicinity of the horizon is given by
vx  1  x
the analysis of 5 leads to the following two connection
formulae
Ke2  e2  s
s  Ke2  e2  0
K  2 sinh12
The notation 1x  2x denotes that the approx-
imate WKB solution 1x behind the horizon connects
k  k0pv2  1  v1  v2
ks  1  v
provided we assume   k0 and choose x  
k023 The WKB solutions are only valid for
x  13k23
 The coecients Cs are neces-
sary to match these WKB solutions to the near-horizon
Laplace transform solutions They can be determined by
comparing the Laplace transform solutions given in 5
to the matching formulae A4a-b with the WKB modes
A6A7 evaluated in the small x limit5 We nd that
the coecients are given by

2 Inner horizon connection formulae
In the case of a black hole with both inner and outer
horizons the connection formulae A4a-b remain valid
4We have changed notation slightly from that in 5 We
have added the lower limit of integration  to the integrals
appearing in the exponents and consequently the coecients
Cs acquire some  dependence to compensate Further-
more a factor of i appearing in the matching formulae of 5
has been absorbed in  and the phase of N as dened in 5
has been absorbed into s We have also renamed the m
solution in 5 as s here
5x cannot be arbitrarily small however because the WKB
approximation breaks down as x  0
In 5 it was shown
that the WKB and Laplace transform approximate solutions
are both valid when 13k23
0  x  1 and therefore
the matching can be done in this range We also choose  to
satisfy the same inequality
locally about each horizon after some slight modica-
tions to be discussed presently but the solutions are no
longer global Assume that the outer horizon is located
at xo  0 with vx taking the same form as given by
A3 and that the inner horizon is at xi  a with vx
near the inner horizon taking the form
vx  1  x  a
We assume that the surface gravity of the inner hori-
zon has the same magnitude as that of the outer horizon
to simplify the results There is no diculty however
in allowing the surface gravities to be dierent Then
the connection formulae A4a-b are valid for equation
A2 locally about the outer horizon where the notation
1x  2x now denotes that 1x is valid between
the horizons and 2x is valid outside the outer horizon
To nd the local mode solutions about the inner
horizon we reexpress the mode equation A2 in terms
of the new coordinate y  x  a The resulting y-
equation is the complex conjugate of the x-equation A2
Since we have chosen the surface gravities to have the
with vx replaced byevy  vy  a We denote the
WKB mode solutions to this y-equation by e and es
same magnitude evy takes the same form near the in-
ner horizon as vx does near the outer horizon A3
Therefore the mode solutions near the inner horizon are
the complex conjugates of those about the outer horizon
with x replaced by y so they satisfy the same connection
formulae
the inner horizon We have included a subscript i in
Kcid0e2e  e2ecid1  eis
es  Kcid0e2e  e2ecid1  0
The notation e1y  e2y now denotes that e1y
is valid between the horizons and e2y is valid inside
eisy to make it clear that this solution is valid only
The WKB solutions esyx are in fact the same
functions of x up to -dependent phases as the WKB
solutions sx respectively To see this note that
the WKB modes sx given in A6A7 all take the
inside the inner horizon

ds kvs cid19 A14
where C is x-independent and f and k are real functions
of vx Since as discussed above the x and y equations
are related by substituting vx  evy  vy  a
and complex conjugating the WKB modes esy are
given by
6We have dropped the  s subscripts on x C f  and k

Using y  x  a and evy  vx and changing the

integration variable in A15 to s  s  a we obtain
a
which diers from A14 only by an -dependent phase
factor ie

rather shall assume the generic form

where   also depend on vx k0 and a the coordinate
distance between the horizons but do not depend on 
as long as it is chosen large enough so that the WKB
approximation holds
Using the phase relations A18 the inner horizon
connection formulae A13aA13b can be reexpressed in
terms of the same linear combinations of  appearing
in the outer horizon formulae A4aA4b

3 Wavepacket evolution formulae
We can now form wavepackets from the modes and
use the mode connection formulae to obtain wavepacket
evolution formuale To keep the latter simple the -
dependence of the coecients in the connection formulae
is built into the denition of the wavepackets as follows

ns Z u
n Z u
n1 Z u
ins Z u
in1s Z u
An eits
Bn eits
Cn eit
Dn1 eit
En eiteis
Fn1 eiteis
where the coecients A    F depend on  and the mode
functions  depend on both  and x
With these denitions the evolution formulae about
the outer horizon 51a51b follow immediately from
the outer horizon connection formulae A4aA4b pro-
vided we choose Cn  K exp2 An and Dn 
K exp2 Bn1 Similarly the inner horizon evo-
lution formula 51c follows provided Bn  eiT1An and
En  T2An while 51d requires Fn  T1Bn1 and
Bn  T3Bn1 The solution up to an undetermined
overall constant is given by

4 Norm of the wavepackets
The wavepackets dened in A22 are not normalized
Their norms can be determined as follows A generic one
of these wavepackets has the form
 Z u
G eit
which has the norm cf 29
   iZ dxZ d
G
Z d
  
G eit
t  vx
t  vx
The norm is conserved under time evolution so it suces
to evaluate it at any one time
The key assumption we need in order to evaluate the
norm is that at some time the wavepacket is conned to
a constant v region This is certainly the case for the
s wavepackets since they are outgoing and eventually
reach the asymptotic region If the region between the
horizons is large and has a large constant velocity region
then it may similarly hold for the s and  wavepack-
ets as well Alternatively these wavepackets spend some
time squeezed near the horizon with wavelengths much
smaller than the length scale over which vx changes
but in the case of ks still much longer than k1
we can nevertheless use the small k approximation If
the wavepacket is contained in a constant v region then
for the purposes of evaluating the norm we can imag-
ine this region to extend to innity in both directions
The xed  mode equation A2 in a constant v region
has solutions   C expikx where   vk  F k
with F k given by 27 Matching to the WKB modes
A6A7 we see that C  1 v2  134 for the s
modes and  modes respectively Thus we have
