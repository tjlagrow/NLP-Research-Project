Abstract
The kinematics of metalenriched lowionization gas at large galac-
tocentric distances are compared to the host galaxy properties and are
discussed in the context of global galaxy evolution
1 Galaxies Selected by Mg II Absorption
Like H i studies the goal of quasar absorption line studies is to develop an
understanding of the role of gas in the formation and evolution of galaxies
Whereas an advantage of H i studies is that both the spatial and lineofsight
velocity distribution of neutral gas can be studied in the context of the galaxy
environment quasar absorption lines oer a complementary approach using an
extremely sensitive pencil beam probe through many galaxies over a wide
range of cosmic epochs independent of redshift absorption lines can sample H i
down to log N H i  12 cm2 eg Tytler 1995
Using the resonant Mg ii 2796 2803 doublet  H i can be probed in galactic
environments with 15  log N H i  21 cm2 Churchill et al 1999 Churchill
 Charlton 1999 Churchill et al 2000 making Mg ii an ideal tracer for studies
of global galaxygas evolution kinematic chemical and ionization The sta-
tistical properties of strongish Mg ii systems are thoroughly documented to
z  22 eg Lanzetta Turnshek  Wolfe 1987 Steidel  Sargent 1992 and
are well established to be associated with bright normal galaxies of almost all
morphological types to z  1 eg Steidel Dickinson  Persson 1994 Steidel
et al 1997 Steidel 1998 Therefore once the requisite observational survey
work is undertaken it is expected that Mg ii absorption can be used as a tracer
of extended gas around galaxies to the highest redshifts where stars rst formed
2 Galaxies and Absorption Kinematics
Because the H i column densities of the gas probed in Mg ii absorption are several
orders of magnitude below those observed with 21cm emission the regions and
physical conditions studied are quite dierent yet complementary to H i studies
The actual Mg ii equivalent width measured from a parcel of gas is dependent
upon ionization condition metallicity H i column density and velocity disper-
sion For a metallicity of 01 solar low ionization gas with log N H i  17 cm2
and a lineofsight velocity dispersion of  20 km s1 would produce a rest
frame equivalent width of Wr2796  03 A This value is well within the
Churchill
detection capabilities of 4meter telescopes However dispersing the absorption
at high resolution to reveal the component to component velocity splittings
requires a 10meter class telescope
In Figure 1 WFPC2HST images of 10 Mg ii absorptionselected galaxies
Steidel 1998 are shown with corresponding absorption line proles of the Mg ii
2796 transition Churchill  Vogt 2000 obtained with HIRESKeck I The
galaxies are presented in increasing impact parameter order from left to right

upper portion of the panels and the redshifts in the lower portion The absorbing
gas is shown in the galaxy restframe velocity from 220 to 220 km s1 Ticks

matics in increasing impact parameter order see text for details
These pencil beam probes reveal a wide range of kinematic complexity
with velocity spreads of  150 km s1 at various impact parameters
small samples including the one shown here there are no statistically signif-
icant  3  correlations between the spatial and kinematic distributions of
the metalenriched N H i gas and the galaxy properties Churchill Steidel 
Vogt 1996 However the stochastic behavior in the gas properties yield gen-

eral trends including decreasing equivalent width Steidel 1995 and increasing
ionization with decreasing optical thickness with impact parameter Churchill
et al 2000
The absorption line results are consistent with H i 21cm kinematic and
spatial distributions which extend to several tens of kiloparsecs often in a at-
tened geometry eg Irwin 1995 also see Charlton  Churchill 1996 1998 The
main dierence is that the H i column densities sampled by the two techniques
dier by as much as three orders of magnitude Within a  40 kpc region
around galaxies the covering factor of H i gas with log N H i  19 cm2 is of-
ten patchy and highly structured spatially see many contributions throughout
this volume whereas the log N H i  17 cm2 gas has a covering factor very
near unity Steidel et al 1994 Regardless of the processes that gives rise to
the gas it is evident that the lling factor ie spatial structure patchiness
decreases as the H i column density increases
An additional important point that can be gleaned from Figure 1 is that
what may appear as a normal galaxy in an optical image may be far from
normal in its spatial and kinematic distribution of metalenriched gas An ex-
ample is the z  0851 very blue compact galaxy at impact parameter 181 kpc
that has velocity splittings as large as 400 km s1 with complex variations in
component strengths
3 Absorption Lines and Global Galaxy Evolution
Strong metalline absorption systems are excellent candidates for placing power-
ful constraints on global galactic evolution models Metals are produced in stars
and stars are produced in galaxies an group element is best suited since it is
a tracer of the earliest stages of stellar evolution ie Type II supernovae Also
the absorption lines should be accessible for study over a large range of redshift
from z  0 to z  5 so that gas can be studied from its rst enrichment by
stars This requires a nearUV transition so that confusion with Ly  forest
lines can be avoided The Mg ii 2796 2803 doublet meets all these criteria
Figure 2 is a schematic of global galaxy evolution based upon the models of
Pei Fall  Hauser 1999 Three basic epochs are shown Growth z  3
Working 1  z  3 and Retirement z  1 with the respective percent
of cosmic time in parenthesis As shown with grey shading Mg ii surveys have
been conducted with detection limits of 03 A from 03  z  22 Lanzetta
et al 1987 Steidel  Sargent 1992 and of 002 A with high resolution from
04  z  14 Churchill et al 1999 Churchill  Vogt 2000
There is strong dierential evolution in the Mg ii equivalent width distri-
bution from z  2 to z  05 in that the strongest systems evolve away from
Working epoch to the Retirment epoch Observationally this is due to
dierential evolution in the complexity of the Mg ii kinematics with equivalent
width Churchill  Vogt 2000 Physically it is likely due to strong metallicity
and stellar evolution until z  1 An additional clue to the Mg ii kinematics evo-
lution is a strong correlation of a separate C iv phase with the Mg ii kinematics
Churchill et al 2000 This suggests a direct connection between mechanisms
that give rise to extended multiphase halos eg star formation Dahlem 1998
and Mg ii kinematics

It is expected that the properties of Mg ii systems will evolve even more
dramatically from z  4 which includes the Growth phase observations
