ABSTRACT
We examine the evolution of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the eagle cosmo-
logical hydrodynamical simulations which has been shown to reproduce the observed
redshift z  01 colour-magnitude distribution well The median u-r of star-forming
blue cloud galaxies reddens by 1 magnitude from z  2 to 0 at xed stellar mass
as their specic star formation rates decrease with time A red sequence starts to
build-up around z  1 due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the
faint end and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active
galactic nuclei AGN at the bright end This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass
red sequence galaxies at z  1 which is mostly lled in by z  0 We quantify the
time-scales of colour transition due to satellite and AGN quenching nding that most
galaxies spend less than 2 Gyr in the green valley On examining the trajectories of
galaxies in a colour-stellar mass diagram we identify three characteristic tracks that
galaxies follow quiescently star-forming quenching and rejuvenating galaxies and
quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track
Key words galaxies colours galaxies evolution galaxies formation
1 INTRODUCTION
A scatter plot of observed galaxies in optical colour versus
broad-band magnitude or stellar mass reveals two rela-
tively well-dened distinct populations a red sequence and
a blue cloud in a volume-limited sample While a narrow
red sequence was evident in early datasets eg Sandage 
Visvanathan 1978 Larson et al 1980 Bower et al 1991
this striking colour bi-modality was perhaps rst revealed
most clearly by Strateva et al 2001 who exploited the
step-change in sample size oered by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey sdss York et al 2000 the statistics and general
properties of these two sequences were subsequently char-
acterised quantitatively by eg Baldry et al 2004 The
u-r colour of a galaxy correlates strongly with its morphol-
ogy Hubble type the galaxy zoo1 citizen science project
and the MegaMORPH survey have put this correlation on

a rm statistical footing Willett et al 2013 Hauler et al
2013 Blue colours are typically due to light from massive
hot young stars Broadly speaking the more massive blue
galaxies are star-forming discs and the fainter ones are irreg-
ulars The red galaxies in contrast are elliptical or lenticular
types with the red colour reecting an old stellar popula-
tion These galaxies are often referred to as red-and-dead
to stress that their star formation has mostly ceased eg
Brammer et al 2009
At higher redshifts z  1 the blue cloud is clearly
dominant and its colour becomes increasingly blue with in-
creasing z Selection eects bias against the detection of red
galaxies at higher z but it is clear that the bright end of
the red sequence is already in place by z  1 albeit with a
small shift in colour eg Wolf et al 2003 Bell et al 2004
It is dicult to establish how these sequences arise or
how individual galaxies evolve in colour space using ob-
servations alone This is because both star formation and
galaxy destruction by mergers change the number density
of galaxies of given mass across time Faber et al 2007
JW Trayford et al
noted that the number density of blue galaxies remains ap-
proximately constant below redshift z  1 whereas that of
red galaxies increases markedly This led them to propose
a model in which one or more mechanisms operate that de-
crease the star formation rate of blue galaxies with such
quenching making galaxies redder until they join the red
sequence Bell et al 2012 showed that there is signicant
scatter in the properties of quenched galaxies One correla-
tion that stood out in their sample is that quenched galaxies
usually exhibit a prominent bulge by association suggesting
a supermassive black hole
A model in which an accreting supermassive black hole
quenches star formation in its host galaxy appears very at-
tractive This is because black hole mass increases rapidly
as a function of bulge mass eg Haring  Rix 2004 Mc-
Connell  Ma 2013 hence such a model might explain why
most massive galaxies are red - as observed Unfortunately
the evidence that star formation in galaxies hosting X-ray
bright AGN is indeed suppressed appears inconclusive Sev-
eral studies have found no correlation between star forma-
tion rate and X-ray luminosity for an X-ray selected sam-
ple of AGN eg Rosario et al 2012 Harrison et al 2012
Stanley et al 2015 However a close to linear correlation
has been observed for galaxies selected in the infrared eg
Delvecchio et al 2015 The fact that the luminosity of an
AGN likely varies on a range of time-scales from hours to
Myrs might explain the apparent disparity Hickox et al
2014 Volonteri et al 2015 Powerful radio galaxies associ-
ated with the centres of groups and clusters do appear to
disrupt the inow of cold gas McNamara  Nulsen 2012
Another well-documented process that quenches star
formation in a galaxy is restriction of its supply of gas by
either ram-pressure stripping of disc gas Larson et al 1980
eg or removal of halo gas eg strangulation Gunn  Gott
1972 as the galaxy traverses a region of higher gas pressure
associated with a group or cluster The quenching of star-
formation turns these satellites red eg Knobel et al 2013
Originally suggested by Gunn  Gott 1972 the eciency
of these mechanisms have been investigated using simula-
tions by many groups eg Quilis et al 2000 Roediger 
Bruggen 2007 with more recently Bahe et al 2013 point-
ing out that galaxies may be stripped before they become
satellites by the gas in the outskirts of massive systems
McCarthy et al 2008 presented a theoretical framework
that improves upon the simple analysis by Gunn  Gott
1972 and describes their simulation results well
Observational conrmation that environmental quench-
ing indeed operates is evidenced by the fact that red galaxies
preferentially reside in regions of high galaxy number den-
sity Dressler 1980 or equivalently that red galaxies are
more strongly clustered than blue galaxies even at xed
mass eg Zehavi et al 2005 and that the clustering am-
plitude of red galaxies depends little on mass in contrast to
that of blue galaxies eg Coil et al 2008 This is compati-
ble with a model where red galaxies reside close to or even
inside more massive and hence strongly clustered halos that
cause the quenching Trends between the environment and
gas content of galaxies provide further evidence with galax-
ies residing in clusters seen to be decient in both HI and
H2 gas relative to the eld eg Cortese et al 2011 Boselli
et al 2014 Particularly convincing is the similarity of the
trails of HI gas seen to be emanating from gas rich galaxies
in clusters eg Chung et al 2007 Fumagalli et al 2014 and
of the ram-pressure stripped gas behind simulated galaxies
that fall onto a cluster eg Roediger  Bruggen 2008
Even though observations suggest two empirical mod-
els of quenching ie AGN and environmental models of
galaxy formation have struggled to reproduce simultane-
ously the detailed distribution of galaxies in the colour-
magnitude diagram and the dierent clustering properties of
red and blue galaxies This is true of semi-analytical mod-
els which use phenomenological prescriptions to describe
the physical processes that lead to quenching eg Font et al
2008 Lacey et al 2015 for example Henriques et al 2015
compare the Munich semi-analytical L-galaxies model to
sdss data Although in many aspects this model reproduces
the observations better than its predecessors limitations re-
main For example L-galaxies u  r colours are consider-
ably more bimodal than observed
Hydrodynamical simulations can in principle model
many physical processes self-consistently but lack of numer-
ical resolution and other limitations of the hydrodynami-
cal integration may limit their realism Fortunately rela-
tively small changes to the basic hydrodynamics scheme eg
Price 2008 Hopkins 2013 seem to resolve most numerical
issues such that the dominant uncertainties in hydrodynam-
ical simulations become associated to the implementation of
unresolved subgrid processes rather than the details of the
hydrodynamics scheme Scannapieco et al 2012 Schaller
et al 2015b
The huge dynamic range required to simulate a cos-
mologically representative volume with the required resolu-
tion to follow the hierarchical build-up of galaxies presents
a major challenge to numerical simulations Until recently
such simulations did not reproduce the galaxy stellar mass
function well let alone the detailed coloursclustering of
galaxies A redblue bimodality appears in the zoomed-
simulations of Cen 2014 even though these do no include
AGN However the rband luminosity function of these
simulation contains many more massive galaxies than ob-
served Gabor  Dave 2012 include the eects of AGN
using a heuristic prescription of heating gas where cooling
is simply switched o in halos deemed massive enough to
host AGN They illustrate how this process builds-up a red
sequence below redshift z  2 initially lower-mass satellites
and more massive quenched centrals appear in heated ha-
los with a characteristic dip in the abundance of red galax-
ies of stellar mass Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 that is more prominent
at higher z While this simulation may provide valuable in-
sight into the build up of the red sequence the heuristic
nature of the halo heating limits their practical applicabil-
ity Sales et al 2015 show that the illustris simulation
Vogelsberger et al 2014 broadly reproduces the colours of
satellites which they attribute to the relatively large gas
fractions of satellites at infall
The eagle reference model was calibrated to the z 
01 stellar mass function black hole masses and sizes of
galaxies and is currently the only hydrodynamical simula-
tion that reproduces these observations Eagle also repro-
duces many independent galaxy observations such as the
content and ionisation state of gas Bahe et al 2016 Lagos
et al 2015b mass proles Schaller et al 2015a and evolu-
tion in star formation rate and size Furlong et al 2015ba
The clustering of galaxies as a function of colour is investi-
MNRAS 000 1 2015
gated in a companion paper Artale et al in prep Tray-
ford et al 2015 showed that eagle reproduces the g-r 
Mr colour magnitude and the g-r  Mcid63 relation from the
gama spectroscopic survey Driver et al 2011 very well
Including a model for dust-reddening computed using the
skirt radiative transfer scheme Baes et al 2005 Camps
 Baes 2015 improves the quantitative agreement further
Trayford et al in prep With low-redshift z  01 galaxy
colours in eagle appearing to be realistic studying how
they have arisen given the physical feedback model of the
simulation may provide new insight
In section 2 we describe the eagle simulations used in
this study particularly the aspects of star formation metal
enrichment and feedback that are most relevant for setting
intrinsic galaxy colours We investigate in section 3 the evo-
lution of the galaxy population across the colour-mass dia-
gram and correlate colour changes with galaxies becoming
satellites or hosting an AGN In section 4 we expound these
processes by analysing the behaviour of individual galax-
ies using galaxy merger trees Typical time-scales associated
with colour transition are presented in section 42 We show
that the colour evolution of most galaxies can be described
well in terms of three generic tracks and quantify the frac-
tion of galaxies that follow each path Finally our ndings
are summarised in section 5 Throughout this work we refer
to dust-free rest-frame colours as intrinsic colours and we
take Zcid12  00127 for the metallicity of the Sun Allende
Prieto et al 2001 Note that while the Zcid12 value aects
the normalisation of metallicities in solar units colours are
unaected by the assumed Zcid12 see Trayford et al 2015
2 THE EAGLE SIMULATIONS
The eagle suite Schaye et al 2015 Crain et al 2015 in-
cludes simulations performed in a range of periodic volumes
and at various numerical resolutions to enable convergence
testing The simulations were performed with the gadget-
3 tree-SPH code Springel 2005 but with changes to the
SPH and time-stepping algorithm collectively referred to as
anarchy see appendix of Schaye et al 2015 for details
and Schaller et al 2015b for the relatively minor impact
of these changes on the properties of simulated galaxies
We use the CDM cosmological parameters advocated by
Planck Collaboration et al 2014 and initial conditions
generated at z  127 Jenkins 2013 using second order
Lagrangian perturbation theory We concentrate here on
analysing the largest reference model Ref-100 This is a cu-
bic cosmological volume of 100 comoving Mpc cMpc on a
side with an initial gas particle mass of mg  181106 Mcid12
The simulation has a Plummer equivalent gravitational soft-
ening of prop  07 proper kpc pkpc at redshift z  0
21 Subgrid model and galaxy identication
The eagle reference model implements subgrid modules for
physical processes that occur below the resolution limit cor-
responding approximately to the Jeans length of the warm
ISM The free parameters that enter the modules for feed-
back were calibrated using the redshift z  01 galaxy stel-
lar mass function the z  01 stellar mass-size relation
and the z  0 stellar mass - black hole mass relation see
MNRAS 000 1 2015
Colour evolution in EAGLE
Crain et al 2015 for motivation and details We briey
summarise these subgrid modules here paying particular
attention to those aspects most crucial for this paper
 Radiative cooling and photo-heating of gas by the
evolving optically-thin UVX-ray background of Haardt 
Madau 2001 is implemented element-by-element following
Wiersma et al 2009a
 Star formation is
implemented as a pressure-law
Schaye  Dalla Vecchia 2008 so that simulated galaxies
reproduce the observed z  0 relation between gas and star
formation surface density of Kennicutt 1998 Each gas par-
ticle is assigned a star formation rate
mcid63 and gas particles
are converted to star particles stochastically The star forma-
tion rate is zero for particles below the metallicity-dependent
threshold of Schaye 2004 We resample young stars using
a probability proportional to the estimates of
mcid63 to reduce
sampling noise when estimating the galaxy luminosities as
described in Trayford et al 2015
 Feedback from star formation is
implemented by
stochastically heating gas particles neighbouring newly-
formed star particles as described by Dalla Vecchia  Schaye
2012
 Seeding merging accretion and feedback from super-
massive black holes is implemented as described in Schaye
et al 2015 Briey dark matter halos with virial mass
 1010 h1Mcid12 are seeded with a black hole of mass
105 h1Mcid12 These can grow through Eddington-limited ac-
cretion of gas while accounting for the gas angular momen-
tum as by Rosas-Guevara et al 2015 and through mergers
with other black holes following Springel et al 2005 and
Booth  Schaye 2009 Feedback from accreting black holes
is modelled by heating the gas in their surroundings
Each star particle represents a simple stellar popula-
tion SSP characterised by an assumed stellar initial mass
function IMF eagle adapts the Chabrier 2003 IMF over
the mass range 01100 Mcid12 and assuming that stars have
a metallicity inherited from the converted gas particle with
a single age corresponding to the time that the gas parti-
cle was converted to a star particle We then use published
stellar life-times evolutionary tracks and yields to compute
the rate at which these stars evolve and lose mass as well
as the rate of core collapse and Type Ia supernova events as
described in Wiersma et al 2009b The simulation tracks
11 elements H He C Ni O Ne Mg Si S Ca Fe as
well as a total metallicity metal mass fraction variable
for each gas and star particle The mass age and metal-
licity of the SSP are input parameters for the population
synthesis model described below
 Dark matter halos are identied using the friends-
of-friends algorithm fof linking dark matter particles
within 02 times the mean inter-particle separation into a
single fof halo Other particles are assigned to the same
halo if any as the nearest dark matter particle We charac-
terise the mass of the halo by its M200crit value This is the
mass enclosed within a sphere of radius R200crit centered on
the location of the particle with minimum gravitational po-
tential in the halo This radius is chosen such that the mean
density within this sphere is 200 times the critical density
given the assumed cosmology
JW Trayford et al
 Galaxies are identied with the subfind algorithm
Springel et al 2001 Dolag et al 2009 subfind identi-
es self-bound substructures within halos which we asso-
ciate with galaxies The central galaxy is the galaxy closest
to the center of the parent fof halo this is nearly always
also the most massive galaxy in that halo The other galax-
ies in the same halo are its satellites Particles in a halo
not associated with a bound substructure ie satellites
are assigned to the central galaxy Central massive galaxies
Mcid63  1011 Mcid12 say then have an extended halo of stars
around them usually referred to as intra-group or intra-
cluster light Determining the mass or indeed luminosity of
such a large galaxy is ambiguous both in simulations and
in observations For this reason we impose an aperture on
the denition of a galaxy we follow Schaye et al 2015 and
calculate masses and luminosities in spherical apertures of
30 pkpc
22 Galaxy colours
The stellar population properties age metallicity  as-
sumed IMF of an eagle galaxy are combined with the
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 population synthesis model to
construct an SED for each star particle Summing spectra
over all stars within the aperture described in section 21 and
convolving with a lter response function yields broad-band
colours which we compute using the ugrizYJHK photomet-
ric system for optical and near infrared photometry taken
from Doi et al 2010 Hewett et al 2006 We express these
absolute magnitudes in the AB-system see Trayford et al
2015 for more details
It is well known that dust can alter the optical colour
of a galaxy signicantly particularly for gas-rich discs seen
edge-on We describe a simple model for dust reddening in
a previous study Trayford et al 2015 as well as a model
that uses ray-tracing to account for the patchy nature of
dust clouds enshrouding star-forming regions described in a
forthcoming study Trayford et al in prep However here
we use the intrinsic ie rest-frame and dust-free colours
of galaxies to examine the changes arising purely from the
evolution of their stellar content To simplify the interpreta-
tion we always quote rest-frame colours there is therefore no
k-correction needed to compare galaxies in the same band
at dierent redshifts We concentrate here on ucid63-rcid63 colours
with the cid63 referring to intrinsic colours rather than gcid63-rcid63
because the u band is more sensitive to recent star forma-
tion leading to more clearly separated bluered colour se-
quences Indeed the ucid63-rcid63 index traverses the 4000A break
often used as a proxy for star formation activity eg Kau-
mann et al 2003 The photometry is presented here with-
out dust eects comparison is possible with various obser-
vational data where dust corrections have been estimated
eg Schawinski et al 2014
3 COLOUR EVOLUTION OF THE ENSEMBLE
GALAXY POPULATION
Figure 1a shows that a scatter plot of eagle galaxies in a
colour-stellar mass diagram ucid63-rcid63 vs Mcid63 exhibits strong
bimodality in colour at redshift z  0 The well dened red
sequence resides at ucid63-rcid63cid38 22 with colours becoming redder
with increasing Mcid63 The blue cloud is at ucid63  rcid63  13
with a slope similar to that of the red sequence These two
sequences are indicated by red and blue lines to guide the
eye respectively obtained by a spline t to the maxima in
the probability distribution of ucid63-rcid63 in bins of Mcid63 We keep
the location of these lines xed in Fig 1b-d to facilitate
comparison at higher z We clearly see that
i The red sequence becomes bluer and less populated
with increasing z It is in place at z  1 but has mostly
disappeared by z  2 A gap in the red sequence is notice-
able at z  1 for Mcid63  1097 Mcid12
ii The blue sequence becomes bluer with increasing z and
exhibits decreasing scatter
The main features of the galaxy population that
drive these trends are illustrated in the bottom panels
of the gure Figs 1e  g show that for a narrow stel-
lar mass range around Mcid63  101025 Mcid12 that ucid63-rcid63 is
strongly anti-correlated with the specic star formation
rate sSFR  Mcid63Mcid63 provided the galaxy is star-forming
log10sSFRGyr cid38 2 This is not surprising since the
light in the ucid63 lter is dominated by emission from mas-
sive and hence young stars while rcid63 is dominated by the
older population Galaxies in this plot follow a very tight
relation at a given z sliding along a narrow locus in colour
that becomes bluer at higher z At z  2 the galaxies fol-
low almost the same relation in ucid63-rcid63 versus sSFR as at
z  0 with just a small but noticeable oset towards red-
der colours  01 mag for log10sSFRGyr cid38 125 This
is a result of the redder population being younger on av-
erage and hence brighter for a z  2 star-forming galaxy
compared to a star-forming galaxy at z  0 For lower star
formation rates log10sSFRGyr cid46 125 the old popu-
lation has more inuence on ucid63-rcid63 and the younger average
stellar age of z  2 galaxies causes an oset to blue colours
With ucid63-rcid63 colour so strongly correlated with sSFR the
colour vs Mcid63 diagram of Fig 1 is one view of the fun-
damental plane of star-forming galaxies discussed recently
by Lagos et al 2015a These authors showed that eagle
galaxies from dierent redshifts fall onto a single 2D surface
Mcid63Mcid63 and gas fraction or
when plotted in the 3D space of
metallicity which they attributed to self-regulation of star
formation Lagos et al 2015a also showed that observed
galaxies follow very similar trends The increasingly bluer
colours of the blue cloud towards higher z is a consequence
of the increased star formation activity at xed Mcid63
The scatter in colour at xed Mcid63 on the red sequence
is mostly due to metallicity Z as is clear from examination
of the ucid63-rcid63 distribution of galaxies at a given Mcid63 with low
sSFR  103 Gyr2 plotted as green points in Fig 1f The
colour of star-forming galaxies with sSFR  103 Gyr1
black points also depends on Z but from comparison of
these panels it is clear that this eect is much smaller than
the dependence of colour on sSFR itself - it induces the small
scatter in ucid63-rcid63 in panel e on top of the main trend with
As discussed by many others the dependence of colour
on Z is also the origin of the slope of the red sequence more
massive galaxies are more metal rich and hence redder see
Trayford et al 2015 To illustrate this we calculated the
median metallicity ZmedMcid63 in bins of stellar mass We
then calculated ucid63-rcid63 colours for a 10 Gyr old population

with that dependence of Z on Mcid63 and plot the resulting
ucid63-rcid63 colour as a function of Mcid63 in Fig 1a as red squares Al-
though this sequence has the same slope as the red sequence
in eagle it is systematically redder by  025 magnitudes
This is not an age eect but a consequence of stellar pop-
ulations exhibiting a spread in metallicity within an eagle
galaxy In fact the metallicity distribution function of stars
in an eagle galaxy is fairly well described by an exponen-
tial distribution We therefore generated another comparison
toy model for the red sequence colour in which we impose
an exponential metallicity distribution and again assume a
coeval 10 Gyr old population The exponential metallicity
distribution is dened by a mean value at xed mass given
by the ZmedMcid63 dependence of eagle galaxies This model
is plotted as lled red circles and it reproduces the eagle
red sequence very well This simple exercise shows that the
assumption that all stars have the same metallicity results in
systematic errors in the metallicity from broad-band colours
We note that the slope of ucid63  rcid63 relation as a function
of Mcid63 in the blue cloud is set by the sSFR-Mcid63 relation and
not by metallicity eects Therefore the similarity between
the slopes of the blue and red lines is coincidental

31 Satellite colours
The extent to which satellite galaxies are preferentially red
relative to the general population is illustrated in Fig 2 We
divide colour vs mass diagrams at dierent redshifts into
equal bins of ucid63-rcid63 and log10Mcid63Mcid12 The satellite fraction
in each bin is computed and normalised by the total satellite
fraction for all galaxies in the same stellar mass range Bins
containing  10 galaxies are shaded by the log10 normalised
satellite fraction such that positive values indicate a higher
than average satellite fraction for that mass while negative
values indicate a lower than average value The satellite frac-
tion as a function of stellar mass in eagle is plotted for each
redshift in the bottom panels
Galaxies with Mcid63  1010Mcid12 that are red are predom-
inately satellites seen most strikingly at z  2 At lower z
there is still a trend for low-mass red galaxies to be satellites
but the trend is less pronounced because some galaxies clas-
sied as centrals are also red To some extent this may be
a consequence of galaxies being quenched by ram-pressure
stripping in the outskirts of more massive halos before they
are classied as being a satellite eg Bahe et al 2013 In-
deed they may not be part of the fof halo yet Another
JW Trayford et al
Figure 2 The impact of satellite fraction on the evolution of the ucid63-rcid63vs Mcid63 colour-stellar mass relation Top panels Each square
corresponds to a bin in colour and Mcid63 and is coloured according to the median normalised satellite fraction in that bin such that higher
satellite fractions correspond to redder colours see the colour bar The satellite fraction is normalised to the average satellite fraction
at that stellar mass bottom panel removing trends of satellite fraction with stellar mass and redshift At z  2 most red galaxies
with Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 are satellites red colour in satellite fraction This trend persists to z  0 although it becomes weaker as galaxies
classied as centrals also get quenched Bottom panels Fraction of galaxies classied as satellites as a function of Mcid63 At redshift
z  0 the satellite fraction is nearly constant at just below 50 per cent below Mcid63  1010Mcid12 and decreases above that mass At higher
z the satellite fraction decreases for all Mcid63
possibility is that some of these galaxies were stripped as
satellites when they fell inside a massive halo but have trav-
elled out again the so-called backsplash population Balogh
et al 2000
At redshift z  0 the fraction of satellites is  50 per
cent at Mcid63  109Mcid12 decreasing slowly to 30 per cent by
Mcid63  10105Mcid12 and then dropping rapidly towards higher
Mcid63 Satellite fractions decrease slowly at all Mcid63 with in-
creasing z to z  1 and then drop much faster to below
30 per cent at all masses by z  2 This rapid drop in the
satellite fraction with increasing z is the reason that the red
sequence disappears at low Mcid63 cid47 1010Mcid12 for z cid38 2
32 AGN host colours
The eect of feedback from accreting black holes on galaxy
colours is illustrated in Fig 3 We only plot central galaxies
to disentangle satellite quenching from eects induced by
AGN The gure is analogous to Fig 2 with median black
hole mass replacing satellite fraction The median black hole
mass M as a function of Mcid63 is plotted for each redshift
as the bottom panels in Fig 3
At redshift z  2 there is a very strong trend for red
galaxies with Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 to exhibit unusually high black
hole masses more than 4 times the median black hole mass
at that stellar mass This trend persists but becomes weaker
at higher Mcid63 and is completely absent at lower masses This
correlation between the residuals of the M  Mcid63 relation
and the colour of the galaxy is still mostly present at z  1
but begins to be washed out at later times
The trend for galaxies with high black hole masses to
be predominantly red when Mcid63 cid39 1010 Mcid12 is likely re-
lated to the largely redshift independent characteristic halo
mass Mh  1012 Mcid12 above which black holes start to
grow rapidly in eagle fed by the growing hot halos around
them Bower et al in prep The accreting black hole then
quenches star formation in its host galaxy turning it red
A corollary of the existence of this characteristic halo mass
is that black holes only start to grow signicantly when the
galaxys stellar mass is  1010 Mcid12 Fig 3 bottom panels
The scatter in the Mcid63  Mh relation results in the transi-
tion between dormant and rapidly growing black holes being
less well-dened in the M  Mcid63 relation in comparison to

Colour evolution in EAGLE

panels Each square corresponds to a bin in ucid63-rcid63 and Mcid63 and is coloured according to the median black hole mass M in that bin
such that larger values of M correspond to redder colours see the colour bar The median black hole mass in each square is normalised
to the median black hole at that stellar mass bottom panel removing trends of M with Mcid63 and redshift At z  2 there is a trend for
redder galaxies to have more massive black holes This trend is particularly striking for galaxies with Mcid63  1010Mcid12 and becomes less
pronounced at higher masses There is no obvious correlation at lower stellar mass These trends persist to lower z but become weaker
Lower panels The median black hole mass M as a function of stellar mass is plotted in solid black Dashed black lines represent the
16th and 84th percentiles M is nearly independent of Mcid63 below Mcid63  1010Mcid12 and increases with Mcid63 above this characteristic mass
This trend is almost independent of redshift
when they become satellites whereas galaxies above this
characteristic mass are quenched by their AGN This rea-
soning also explains why the red sequence starts to build-up
from both the low-mass and the high-mass ends leaving ini-
tially a noticeable scarcity of red galaxies at Mcid63  1097Mcid12
at z  1 Such galaxies are too low mass to host a vigor-
ously accreting black hole yet too massive to be satellites
in the typically lower-mass groups at that higher z It is not
until redshifts z  1 that the more massive halos that host
Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 satellites appear
The extent to which eagle predicts the characteris-
tic stellar mass above which AGN quenching occurs and
the evolution of the underabundance of intermediate-mass
red galaxies not only depends on the details of the sub-
grid physics but also on the volume that is simulated This
is because massive clusters are under-represented or simply
absent due to missing large-scale power in the density eld
and poor sampling of rare objects in the relatively small
periodic eagle volume of 1003 cMpc3 However we believe
that the relevant physics described here is robust and cor-
roborates the similar conclusions of Gabor  Dave 2012
who used an ad-hoc model for quenching in massive galax-
ies as opposed to our physically motivated subgrid scheme
MNRAS 000 1 2015
for the eagle simulations that are implemented on smaller
sub-kpc scales
A corollary of satellite quenching for lower-mass galax-
ies and AGN quenching for more massive galaxies is that
these low- and high-mass red galaxies tend to inhabit the
same dark matter halos The more massive red galaxy is
the central galaxy of this halo and is quenched by its AGN
Conversely the lower-mass red galaxies are the satellites of a
massive central red galaxy This eect is termed galaxy con-
formity Kaumann et al 2013 As a consequence the low-
and high-mass red galaxies have similar clustering strengths
with both clustering more strongly than blue galaxies ea-
gle reproduces the observed clustering as a function of
colour and luminosity well as will be discussed by Artale
et al in prep We next investigate how and at what rate
individual galaxies move through the ucid63-rcid63 vs Mcid63 diagram

and z2  1 snapshots a period of  09 Gyr The left panel shows the galaxy ow interpolated between the z  01 and z  0 snapshots
to yield the same time period with z1  007 and z2  0 Black circles represent the mean location of galaxies at z1 selected in a bin of
ucid63-rcid63- Mcid63 the size of the circle is proportional to the logarithm of the total stellar mass in galaxies in that bin Black vectors represent
the mean motion of the galaxies in that bin between z1 and z2 Orange vectors purple vectors are for those galaxies that at redshift
z2 belong to halos with virial mass M200crit  1013Mcid12 M200crit  1013Mcid12 Centre coordinates and vectors sampling fewer than 10
galaxies are not plotted The overall distribution at the later redshift is plotted as grey contours for comparison We do not take into
account galaxies merging into hosts that are more than four times their mass illustrating such mergers in more detail in Fig 8
at one redshift we measure the median dierence in ucid63-rcid63
and log10Mcid63 for their descendant galaxies at a second red-
shift We plot these dierences for galaxies over an equal
time period at high z  1 and low z  0 redshift This
is achieved by using two consecutive snapshots z  13 and
z  1 for the left panel corresponding to a time interval
of  09 Gyr and interpolating the galaxy vectors between
the lowest redshift snapshots z  01 and z  0 to match
the same time period Descendants that grow in Mcid63 by a
factor  4 through merging into a more massive host galaxy
are eliminated from the measurement to prevent them con-
tributing extreme vectors to their bin
For both redshift ranges it is clear that the colours
of galaxies generally become redder with vectors pointing
in the positive ucid63-rcid63 direction Exceptions can be seen on
the red sequence in which some red galaxies become star-
forming following a gas-rich merger - we discuss the fraction
of such rejuvenated galaxies below Red sequence galax-
ies show little change in ucid63-rcid63 but in general those with
Mcid63 cid46 101075Mcid12 lose mass with only the most massive red
sequence galaxies showing mass growth Considering that we
do not count mergers into hosts of factor  4 higher Mcid63 this
suggests that red sequence galaxies are being stripped prior
to a dry merger with a massive central We also see evidence
of mass quenching with the vectors for blue-cloud selected
galaxies becoming steeper with increasing stellar mass For
Mcid63  1010Mcid12 this is attributable to the presence of AGN
Fig 3
Another notable behaviour seen in Fig 4 is that the
bluest galaxies ucid63-rcid63  05 left panel tend to change their
ucid63-rcid63colour more than the average blue galaxy to the extent
that they end-up on the red side of the blue sequence at the
later redshift The strong reddening and mass increase of
these galaxies suggests that they are starbursts triggered
just prior to a merger Such a scenario is consistent with the
fact that a higher proportion of satellites are found at these
colours than at the centre of the blue peak see Fig 2
For each redshift range we see that galaxies in more
massive halos red vectors have a stronger median shift in
ucid63-rcid63 than their low-mass halo counterparts blue vectors
suggesting that they have a higher likelihood of quenching
Galaxies in massive halos also generally exhibit more mass
loss than the overall population showing the role of envi-
ronment in how galaxies evolve in the ucid63-rcid63 Mcid63 plane
42 Evolution of colour populations in eagle
To track the evolution of galaxies selected to be red blue
or green we must rst dene these populations To do this
we apply cuts that evolve with redshift z for red and blue
galaxies
ucid63  rcid63red  02 log10Mcid63Mcid12  025 z06  024
ucid63  rcid63blue  02 log10Mcid63Mcid12  025 z06  031
The green galaxies are taken to be those that are not in-
cluded in either set These cuts are dened in an ad-hoc
way to divide the galaxies into three populations at each
redshift This is a similar procedure to that used by many
observational studies with authors adopting diering func-
tional forms and normalisations see eg the discussion in
Taylor et al 2015 The exact form of the colour cuts is

43 Colour-mass tracks of individual galaxies
We have examined a large number of tracks of individ-
ual galaxies in ucid63-rcid63 Mcid63 space and have identied three
generic tracks that we illustrate in Fig 7 In Fig 8 we also
show the track of a central galaxy that is very massive at
z  0 Mcid63  1011Mcid12 to illustrate individual tracks of
satellites that merge with it More details of the four galaxies
tracked in these panels are given in Table 1 The time-scale
over which galaxies transition to the red sequence is com-
pared to that of a passively evolving population by plotting
single star-burst tracks initiated at dierent times grey
curves in middle panels
The blue track in Fig 7 is for a galaxy that remains
in the blue cloud down to z  0 forming stars in a blue
disc that grows in time As its sSFR decreases with time
and the contribution of an older population of stars becomes
more important it slowly reddens with ucid63-rcid63  02 from
z  1 to z  0 elapsed time  8 Gyr We see from Table 1
and Fig 3 that the black hole mass is  06 dex lower than
the median value for its stellar mass at approximately the
3rd percentile of galaxies for that Mcid63 suggesting low levels
of black hole feedback in the galaxys history
The red track in Fig 7 corresponds to a galaxy that
becomes red more rapidly reddening by ucid63-rcid63  1 in
 2 Gyr joining the red sequence at z  2 From then on
its colour or stellar mass hardly changes it has been a very
compact elliptical galaxy since at least z  1 maintaining
a stellar half-mass radius of  23 pkpc The similar rate
of colour transition for this galaxy to that of an instanta-
neous starburst suggests rapid quenching of star formation
Considering the black hole mass in Table 1 and the bottom-
left panel Fig 3 shows that the galaxy has a central black
hole mass  06 dex higher than the median black-hole stel-
lar mass relation at approximately the 99th percentile of
galaxies for that Mcid63 suggestive of black hole quenching
The thick green track shows a galaxy that reddens at
MNRAS 000 1 2015
Colour evolution in EAGLE
a similar rate ucid63-rcid63  15 in  2 Gyr at z  1 after
undergoing a near-equal mass merger thin green line indi-
cates the track of the other galaxy It then changes mor-
phology from being a disturbed disc to a compact elliptical
at z  05 At redshift z  025 it starts forming stars again
turning blue ucid63-rcid63  1 over  2 Gyr By z  0 it has
grown signicantly in size with a prominent bulge and an
extended distribution of stars around it The value of M in
Table 1 puts the black hole mass at approximately the 75th
percentile of galaxies for that stellar mass
The massive z  0 galaxy in Fig 8 is a blue star-
forming disc until just below z  1 after which it becomes
red and evolves into an elongated elliptical Thin lines show
the tracks of ve galaxies that merge with it with the line
colour changing from blue to red while these galaxies be-
come satellites Examination of these tracks reveals that
while some galaxies become red when they are still centrals
most galaxies quench after being identied as satellites This
suggests that satellite identication is a good predictor of
colour change in eagle particularly for galaxies falling into
a more massive halo The satellite tracks exhibit a charac-
teristic shape of rapid quenching followed by stellar mass
loss as the galaxy is stripped and eventually merges We
also see that the central galaxy exhibits quite a stochastic
colour evolution compared to those in Fig 7 perhaps due
to the interaction with satellite galaxies
To quantify the fraction of galaxies that undergo a rapid
colour transformation we trace the main progenitors of all
galaxies with mass Mcid63  1010Mcid12 at z  0 back in time
a sample of  3000 galaxies We nd that the fraction
of galaxies with at least one ucid63-rcid63  08 change over
any 2 Gyr period in their history is  40 per cent We will
refer to such galaxies as rapidly reddening galaxies they
follow a track similar to the red track in Fig7 Galaxies
that do not not ever undergo such a rapid reddening event
make-up 60 per cent of the sample We will refer to these
as quiescently star-forming galaxies they follow a track
similar to the blue track in Fig7 Of the galaxies that redden
quickly  16 per cent undergo a colour change to the blue
of ucid63-rcid63  08 over a 2 Gyr period We will refer to
this small fraction of galaxies galaxies as rejuvenated they
follow track similar to the green track in Fig 72
Fig 9 shows the distribution of z  0 colours for
1010  Mcid63Mcid12  10105 galaxies classied as having un-
dergone a rapid transformation to redder colour red his-
togram and those that never underwent such a rapid red-
dening quiescently star-forming galaxies blue histogram
A small fraction of galaxies become red without ever ex-
periencing a rapid reddening event this is the tail of the
blue histogram towards red ucid63-rcid63 colour Similarly there is
a tail to blue ucid63-rcid63 colour in the red histogram representing
galaxies that underwent a rapid colour transition to the red
followed by more recent star formation turning them blue
once more The fraction of these galaxies is much higher
than the 16 per cent of galaxies we classied as rejuvenat-
2 Galaxies may also undergo slower colour transitions due to sec-
ular evolution and the number density of galaxies does not re-
main constant because of mergers These quoted fractions there-
fore inevitably depend on how galaxies are selected ie the colour
choice we made in Eq 1

The mode of the colour transition time distribution is
 15 Gyr with a median of  2 Gyr mostly independent
of whether quenching is likely due to becoming a satellite or
AGN activity blue and red histograms respectively This
is the time-scale for a passively evolving blue population of
stars to turn red as can be seen from Fig7 Strikingly there
is a very long tail to high values in the distribution of tgreen
as inecient quenching allows a small fraction of galaxies
to spend a long time in the green valley before eventually
turning red whether due to becoming a satellite or hosting
an AGN Though quenched galaxies are more prevalent in
high-mass halos the colour transition time-scales show little
dependence on halo mass Despite this the longest time-
scales we measure are for halo masses  1013 Mcid12
The time-scales for colour transition and the quenching
of star formation are clearly linked however colour transi-
tion times are longer due to the passive evolution of stellar
populations This is illustrated by the grey curves in Fig 7
and 8 showing that the colour transition time for an SSP
is  2 Gyr The quenching time-scales of observed satellites
presented by Muzzin et al 2014 are signicantly shorter
typically cid46 05 Gyr Although the ucid63-rcid63 colour index alone
is not sensitive enough to resolve these quenching times the
typical colour transition times of eagle galaxies are consis-
tent with such rapid quenching An analysis of the physical
quenching times is left to a future study

5 CONCLUSIONS
We have investigated the evolution and origin of the colours
of galaxies in the eagle cosmological hydrodynamical sim-
ulation Schaye et al 2015 Crain et al 2015 We apply the
single population synthesis models from Bruzual  Char-
lot 2003 to model galaxy colours in the absence of dust
as described by Trayford et al 2015 We also use galaxy
merger trees to trace descendants as well as main progeni-
tors through time
The ucid63-rcid63 vs Mcid63 diagram is bimodal at redshift z  0
with a clearly dened red sequence of quenched galaxies and
a blue cloud of star-forming galaxies The scatter and slope
of the red sequence are both determined mainly by stellar
metallicity while the normalisation additionally depends on
stellar age Fig 1 The scatter in the blue cloud in contrast
is mostly due to scatter in the specic star formation rate at
xed stellar mass sSFR  Mcid63Mcid63 The slope of blue cloud
colours versus Mcid63 is similar to that of the red sequence but
as their origins are dierent this is coincidental At higher
z both colour sequences become bluer and the red sequence
becomes less populated until it has mostly disappeared by
From studying the evolution of eagle galaxies in ucid63-rcid63
and Mcid63 we note that in general
 Galaxies in eagle turn red either because they become
satellites mainly at lower masses see Fig 2 or because of
feedback from their central supermassive black hole mainly
for more massive galaxies see Fig 3 As a consequence the
red sequence builds-up from both the low-mass and high-
mass sides simultaneously with the low-mass red galaxies
being satellites of the massive red centrals that are quenched
by their AGN This results in a dearth of red galaxies at in-
termediate mass Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 at z  1 - such galaxies
are too low mass to host a massive black hole but too mas-
sive for a large fraction of them to be satellites in the ea-
gle volume While we believe the existence of such a decit
is unlikely to change with increased simulation volume it
should be noted that the limited volume and lack of large
scale power in the eagle 1003 Mpc3 simulation may aect
the depth of the decit
 The colour evolution in the blue cloud is driven by the
decrease in the sSFR rates of star-forming galaxies with cos-
mic time
 The characteristic time scale for galaxies to cross the
green valley from the blue cloud to the red sequence Fig
10 is tgreen  2 Gyr mostly independent of galaxy mass
and cause of the quenching It is determined by the rate
of evolution of a passive population of blue stars to the
red This timescale is consistent with rapid or instantaneous
quenching of star formation as inferred from observations
of satellite galaxies by Muzzin et al 2014 The distribu-
tion of tgreen has an extended tail to  10 Gyr a small
fraction of galaxies remain green for a long time However
most galaxies spend only a short time tgreen cid46 2 Gyr in
the green valley - it is not easy being green
We identied three characteristic tracks that galaxies
follow in the ucid63-rcid63vs Mcid63 diagram Figs 7 and 8 Quies-
cently star-forming galaxies remain in the blue cloud at all
times without sudden reddening episodes of ucid63-rcid63  08
in any 2 Gyr interval Nearly 60 per cent of galaxies with
stellar mass at z  0 greater than Mcid63  1010 Mcid12 fall into
this category see Fig 9 The remaining 40 per cent of
galaxies do undergo such sudden episodes of star formation
suppression The majority of these rapidly reddened galaxies
move onto the red sequence permanently as per the evolu-
tionary picture of Faber et al 2007 however we nd that
16 per cent undergo an episode in which star formation
causes the galaxy to change colour to the blue again hav-
ing ucid63-rcid63  08 over a 2 Gyr period eg Fig 7 The
fraction of such rejuvenating galaxies is thus very small Nev-
ertheless a much larger fraction of the galaxies that at z  0
are blue were red in the past the rate of colour transition of
galaxies to the blue is much slower than that of rejuvenating
galaxies
