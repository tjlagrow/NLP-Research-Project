ABSTRACT   
The manner the galaxy accretes matter along with the star formation rates at different epochs in-
fluence the evolution of the stable isotopic inventories of the galaxy A detailed analysis is present-
ed here to study the dependence of the galactic chemical evolution on the accretion scenario of the 
galaxy  along  with  the  star  formation  rate  during  the  early  accretionary  phase  of  the  galactic  thick 
disk  and  thin  disk  Our  results  indicate  that  a  rapid  early  accretion  of  the  galaxy  during  the  for-
mation of the galactic thick disk  along with  an enhanced star formation rate in the early stages of 
the galaxy accretion could explain the majority of the galactic chemical evolution trends of the ma-
jor elements  Further we corroborate the  recent  suggestions regarding  the formation  of a massive 
galactic thick disk rather than the earlier assumed low mass thick disk

1 Introduction 
The  big-bang  origin  of  the  universe  occurred  137  billion  years  Gyr  ago  The  onset  of  the 
accretion  of  the  Milky-way  galaxy  along  with  the  formation  of  the  earliest  generations  of  stars  is 
considered  to  have  commenced  quite  early  The  various  stellar  nucleosynthetic  processes  that 
operate  within  the  numerous  generations  of  stars  formed  over  the  evolution  of  the  galaxy 
established the galactic inventories of all the stable nuclides 1-5 The gradual growth of the stable 
isotopic  abundances  of  the  galaxy  critically  depend  upon  the  accretional  growth  scenario  of  the 
galaxy and the star formation rate at different epochs 1-5 The traditional adopted approach for the 
formation  of the Milky-way  galaxy involves  episodes of  two exponentially declining  accretionary 
growth  related  with  the  formation  of  the  galactic  thick  and  thin  disks  1  4  5  According  to  this 
scenario the accretional growth of the galactic thick disk occurred over a timescale of the initial 1 
billion  years  whereas  the  accretional  growth  of  the  galactic  thin  disk  occurred  over  a  prolonged 
timescale of 7 billion years This scenario deals with the formation of a massive thin disk with the 
final surface mass density of 44 M pc-2 subsequent to the accretion of the galactic thick disk with 
a  final  surface  mass  density  of  10  M  pc-2  see  eg  4  This  adopted  accretion  scenario  of  the 
galaxy has been used in the previous GCE galactic chemical evolution models 13-5 to explain 
the majority of the observed features of the galaxy in terms of the elemental abundance evolution 
and the supernovae rates An alternative scenario involving two main accretion episodes with both 
Gaussian infall rates has been also proposed for the formation of the galaxy 2 The timescale for 
the accretion of the galactic thin disk was assumed to be 4 Gyr in some of these models   
On the basis of the observed elemental composition of the F G and K dwarf stars in the solar vi-
cinity two alternative scenarios for the formation of the galaxy have been recently proposed 6-8 
One  of  these  scenarios  involve  episodes  of  three  exponentially  declining  accretionary  growth  6 
involving  the  rapid  accretion  of  the  galactic  halo  and  the  thick  disk  over  a  timescale  of  02  and 
125 Gyr respectively followed by a prolonged accretion of the thin disk over a timescale of 6 
Gyr On contrary to the traditional scenarios with a thick disk of low mass 10 M pc-2 in com-
parison to  a massive thin disk  44 M pc-2 1-5 the surface mass density of the thick  and thin 
disks were optimized to 24 and 30 M pc-2 respectively in order to explain the elemental abun-
dance evolutionary trends 6 The star formation rate SFR in this scenario was evaluated on the 
basis of the prevailing total surface mass and gas densities 1-5     
An alternative  scenario  for the formation  and the evolution  of the galaxy  has been recently pro-
posed 7 8 on the basis of the distribution of SiFe versus age of the F G and K dwarf stars in the 
solar vicinity This scenario is based on the closed box approximation for the GCE with no inflow 
or outflow of matter The galaxy is assumed to have accreted matter rapidly in the early universe A 
phase  transition  between  the  galactic  thick  and  thin  disk  occurs  8-9  Gyr  ago  The  thick  disk  ac-
quires  almost  half  of  the  mass  On  contrary  to  all  the  previous  works  on  GCE  1-6  the  star  for-
mation rate was not estimated on the basis of the prevailing total and gas surface mass densities 7 
8 It was rather considered as a fitting parameter to reproduce the distribution of SiFe versus age 
of the F G and K dwarf stars in the solar vicinity This work suggests the presence of large amounts 
of gas in the beginning of the formation of the galaxy and an enhanced early star formation rate               
Based on these two recent proposed scenarios 6-8 in the present work we study the influence of 
the rapid early accretion and rapid early star formation history of the galaxy within the framework 
of episodes of two exponentially declining accretionary growth of the galactic thick and thin disks 
We present results on the basis of our N-body numerical simulations of the evolution of the galaxy 
whereby  we  treat  the  formation  and  evolution  of  several  generations  of  stars  during  the  galactic 
evolution The analysis was performed to reproduce the bulk elemental abundance of the sun 5 9 
at the time of its formation The numerically deduced normalized elemental abundance distribution 
trends of some major elements were compared with the observed elemental abundance distribution 
of F G and K dwarf stars in the solar vicinity The essential aim is to parametrically impose con-
straint on the formation of the galactic thick and thin disks along with the star formation history     
2 Numerical simulations   
The  conventional  approach  of  developing  the  GCE  model  deals  with  numerically  solving  the 
integro-differential equations dealing with the isotopic abundance evolution 1-4 6 An alternative 
approach  of  the  N-body  numerical  simulation  was  developed  5  10-13  to  evolve  the  galaxy  in 
terms of formation and evolution of numerically simulated stars of different generations A detailed 
parametric  analysis  of  the  GCE  model  was  performed  to  constrain  the  galaxy  formation  scenario 
the star formation rate the stellar initial mass function and the supernova Ia SN Ia contributions to 
the  GCE  5  The  analysis  on  the  influence  of  the  star  formation  rate  and  the  SN  Ia  rate  on  GCE 
10 indicated an enhanced star formation rate in the beginning of the formation of the galaxy Fur-
ther  it  was  also  concluded  10  that  a  proposed  normalized  SN  Ia  delay  distribution  14  corre-
sponding to  single degenerate SN  Ia with  a 13   contributions of the  prompt SN  Ia would  ade-
quately  explain  the  SN  Ia  contributions  to  GCE  The  inhomogeneous  GCE  models  11  further 
supported these deductions A detailed analysis of SN II  SN Ibc contributions on GCE indicated 
several limitations related with the use of specific set of stellar nucleosynthetic yields on the GCE 
models 12   
In the present  work we  specifically study the role of the galaxy formation scenario and the star 
formation  rate on GCE  The work is  motivated by  the recent  developments  6-8 that present  two 
distinct  views  regarding  the  formation  of  the  galaxy  One  of  these  works  6  deals  with  the  pro-
longed formation of the galaxy 6 and the other one deal with the rapid accretion of the galaxy in 
the  early  universe  7  8  However  as  mentioned  earlier  both  of  these  works  indicate  rapid  for-
mation of a massive thick disk

We have developed numerical simulations of GCE in the solar neighborhood using the formu-
lation discussed elaborately in the earlier works 5 10-13 We have specifically adopted our recent 
models for the formulation of the SN Ia and the star formation rate 10 We here avoid repetitive 
discussion  of  the  details  of  the  numerical  simulations  We  adopted  the  scenario  related  with  two 
exponentially declining accretionary growth episodes associated with the formation of the galactic 
thick and thin disks with the assumed timescales of 1 Gyr and 7 Gyr respectively 1 3-5 The ex-
tent of the distribution of mass among the galactic thick and thin disks is treated as one of the simu-
lation parameters to understand its dependence on GCE Table 1 The traditional galaxy accretion 
scenario deals with the formation of a galactic thick disk with a final surface mass density of 10 
M pc-2 Table 1 This is subsequently followed by the accretion of a massive thin disk with a final 
surface mass density of 44 M pc-2 see eg 4 The Model A Table 1 refers to this specific sce-
nario We ran Model B  C by varying the final accreted mass distribution of the galactic thick and 
thin disks The star formation rate in the present work was estimated on the basis of the prevailing 
total surface and gas baryonic matter density of the galaxy 4 5 10 11 This approach is identical 
to the recent work 6 The Models A B and C were run by assuming a value of 1 for the star for-
mation rate parameter  see Equation 1 of 10 The simulations Model D and E were run with 
a value of 3 for  It has been demonstrated earlier 10 11 that the GCE models with this particular 
value explain majority of the observed elemental abundances distribution of the F G and K dwarf 
stars in the solar vicinity It should be noted that the Models B and D Table 1 in the present work 
deals with the accretion of the galactic thick disk of substantial mass that is comparable to the thin 
disk These scenarios are almost identical to the recent GCE scenario 6 However the Models C 
and E Table 1 deal with rapid accretion of substantial matter in the early evolution of the galaxy 
Although this scenario does not  exactly correspond to  the SFR and galaxy formation  formulation 
that was adopted in the recent works 7 8 the two distinct approaches however would eventually 
result in an early rapid growth of the galaxy and an early enhanced star formation           
During  the  evolution  of  the  galaxy  in  the  solar  vicinity  the  stars  in  the  mass  range  01-100  M 
were formed at the time of formation of stellar clusters of different generations according to an as-
sumed  piece-wise  three  step  normalized  stellar  initial  mass  function  IMF  5  10-13  The  power 
exponent x of the IMF in the mass rages 11-100 M was considered as one of the simulation pa-
rameters Table 1 to reproduce the metallicity of 0014 9 and FeH  0 at the time of formation 
of the solar system 10-13 The stellar nucleosynthetic yields of SN II  SNI bc 15 the low and 
the intermediate mass stars 16 and SN Ia 17 were used to deduce the stable isotopic abundance 
evolution of the various elements from hydrogen to zinc over the galactic timescales We adopted 
the  SN  Ia  formulation  that  involves  a  SN  Ia  normalized  delay  distribution  14  corresponding  to 
single degenerate SN Ia with a 13  contributions of the prompt SN Ia 10 A fraction f of stars 
in the mass range 3-16 M from the IMF was considered as one of the other simulation parameters 
apart from the parameter x Table 1 This fraction of stars evolves as binary stars and eventually 
produces  SN  Ia  the  main  contributors  of  the  iron-peaked  nuclides  to  the  galaxy  The  optimized 
values of the simulation fitting parameters are mentioned in Table 1 
3 Results and Discussion 
    Numerical simulations were run to study the dependence of the galaxy formation scenario and the 
star  formation  rate  on  the  galactic  elemental  abundance  evolution  Table  1  The  star  formation 
rates  SFR  inferred  from  the  simulations  are  presented  in  Figure  1  Compared  to  Model  A  the 
Models B and C infer higher star formation rate during the early evolution of the galaxy The star 
formation rate parameter  see Equation 1 of 10 in these models was assumed to be 1 It is in-
teresting that the deduced SFR in the case of Model C follows almost an identical trend as observed 
in the recent work based on treating the SFR as a fitting parameter 7 As mentioned earlier even 
though the present adopted approach is distinct from the recent work 7 the two approaches how-
ever  identically  invoke  an  early  rapid  accretion  of  the  galaxy  and  a  high  SFR  An  increase  in  the 
value of SFR parameter  to 3 results in a further enhancement of the SFR as is noticed in the case 
of simulations Model D and Model E This aspect was also noticed in the recent work 6 It should 
be mentioned that the galactic thick disk is assumed to accrete over a timescale of 1 Gyr and the 
parameter  is taken to be unity during the accretion of galactic thin disk in all the simulations The 
enhanced SRF during the early accretion of the galaxy results in a lower SRF during the latter evo-
lutionary stages of the galaxy in all the simulations 
The numerically simulated total baryonic surface matter density accretion and distribution for 
the  various  models  is  presented  in  Figure  2  Due  to  substantially  more  baryonic  matter  accretion 
during the galactic thick disk accretionary stage Table 1 the Models B and D acquire an earlier 
high matter accretion compared to the Model A The Models C and E result in an even higher mat-
ter accretion during the early evolution of the galaxy All the models eventually acquire an identical 
present day observed value of 54 M pc-2 for the combined galactic thick and thin disks total bar-
yonic  matter  surface  density  The  distributions  of  the  baryonic  matter  among  stars    stellar  rem-
nants and interstellar gas are also presented in  Figure 2 for the various models Compared to the 
Model A the early enhanced star formation in the models B and C occurs due to the early rapid ac-
cretion  of  the  galaxy  There  is  a  sharp  rise  in  the  surface  gas  density  prior  to  enhanced  star  for-
mation  Compared to the Models  B and C in the case of the Models D and E a further enhance-
ment in the SFR during the initial couple of billion years is due to the choice of a higher value of 3 
for the SFR parameter  Table 1 However it should be noted that this does not significantly alter 
the SFR during the latter stages of the galaxy evolution   
The predicted supernovae rates for the various simulations are presented in Figure 3 The SNII 
SNIbc supernovae rates follow the star formation rate temporal trends Figure 1 This is due to 
the fact that most of the massive 11 M stars explode as SNII SNIbc within a timescale of 25 
million years Myr subsequent to their formation in a stellar cluster 11-13 The enhancement in 
the  star  formation  rate  Figure  1  in  the  earlier  stages  of  galaxy  results  in  earlier  enhanced  SNII 
SNIbc rates This would result in an earlier enrichment of the stellar nucleosynthetic yields of the 
massive stars It should be also noted that the power exponent x of the stellar initial mass function 
increases due to the earlier rapid accretion of the galaxy or the enhancement in the SFR Table 1 
Further as mentioned earlier the SN Ia rates are according to the normalized delay distribution of 
single degenerate SN Ia with a 13  contributions of the prompt SN Ia 10 14 The fraction f of 
the stars in the mass range 3-16 M that eventually results in SN Ia decreases with the earlier rapid 
accretion of the galaxy or the enhancement of SFR Table 1     
The estimated evolutionary trends in the FeH versus age are presented in Figure 4 for all the 
models As far as the earlier temporal evolutionary trend in the FeH are concerned the Model D 
explains the best match with the observational data of the F G and K dwarf stars in the solar vicin-
ity  The  Model  D  corresponds  to  the  scenario  dealing  with  the  early  rapid  accretion  of  a  galactic 
thick disk with a mass comparable to the galactic thin disk Table 1 This scenario also deals with 
an enhanced star formation rate with a value of 3 for the SFR parameter  10-11 Based on the 
comparison among the Models B-C and D-E Figure 4 it should be noted that a further increase in 
the mass of the galactic thick disk in comparison with the thin disk Table 1 makes the mismatch 
larger with the observational data in the earlier temporal evolutionary trends in FeH   
The temporal normalized evolutionary trends of some major elements for the Models B C D and 
E  are  presented  in  Figure  5  As  mentioned  earlier  an  enhanced  SNII  SNIbc  rates  in  the  early 
evolution  of  the  galaxy  result  in  an  earlier  enrichment  of  heavier  elements  due  to  the  stellar 
nucleosynthetic yields of massive stars Except for nitrogen the Models D and E with an enhanced 
SFR in  the early  galaxy  results in  earlier high elemental  yields  compared to  the Models B and C 
The Models D and E provide a better match with the observational data Further except for carbon 
nitrogen copper and zinc the elemental evolutionary trends among the Models B-C and D-E hav-
ing  an  identical  value  of  the  SFR  parameter    are  not  distinct  Based  on  the  normalized  SiFe 
versus  FeH  Figure  5  and  FeH  versus  age  Figure  4  it  seems  that  the  Model  D  could  be 
most preferred choice for FeH  -10 7 Finally as discussed in the earlier works it is impossi-
ble to match all the elemental evolutionary trends with the observational data 5 10-12     
4 Conclusions 
Based on the detailed numerical simulations of the galactic chemical evolution we corroborate 
the  recent  findings  6  7  that  the  formation  of  the  galactic  thick  disk  of  mass  comparable  to  the 
mass of the galactic thin disk occurred rapidly in the early universe This was followed by the ac-
cretion  of  a  galactic  thin  disk  perhaps  over  a  prolonged  timescale  Further  we  present  predicted 
normalized elemental evolutionary trends for several elements for the first time
