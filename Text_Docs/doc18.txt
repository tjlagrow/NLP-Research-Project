Abstract The CNOC2 Field Galaxy Redshift Survey presently con-
tains some 5000 galaxy redshifts plus extensive UBgRI photometry and
is the largest galaxy sample at moderate redshifts 01  z  06 Here we
present some preliminary results on the galaxy luminosity function LF
and its redshift evolution using a sample of R  215 CNOC2 galaxies
subdivided into early intermediate and late types based on their B  R
colors relative to non-evolving galaxy models We nd a signicant steep-
ening in the faint-end slope  of the LF as one proceeds from early to late
types Also for all galaxy types we nd a rate of M  evolution consistent
with that from passively evolving galaxy models Finally late-type galax-
ies show positive density evolution with redshift in contrast to negative
or no density evolution for earlier types
Introduction to the Survey
The determination of the clustering luminosity star formation and other prop-
erties of galaxies and the measurement of the evolution of those properties with
redshift are fundamentally important goals of observational cosmology The
CNOC2 Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Red-
shift Survey is explicitly designed to study the evolution of galaxy clustering
and luminosity properties over 01  z  06 and currently constitutes the
largest galaxy sample at these intermediate redshifts see Yee et al 1997 for
more details The survey has a total area of some 15 deg2 in the form of
4 widely-separated patches on the sky where each patch is an L-shape that
spans about 15 The spectroscopic observations are carried out at the Canada-
France-Hawaii Telescope using ecient MOS multi-slit spectroscopy of typically
100 objects at once This is made possible with a band-limiting lter that re-

The present CNOC2 survey redshift histogram Note that
stricts the spectra to 4300-6300 A resulting in a redshift range 012  z  055
with unbiased coverage of important galaxy absorption and emission features
Redshift errors are about 75 km s1 in the rest frame The survey also includes
5-color UBgRI photometry for nearly all elds plus K for some with average
5 limits at Kron-Cousins R  240 and B  246
At present 1197 the CNOC2 survey is 80 complete with 3 of the 4
patches essentially done The survey contains some 5000 redshifts with nearly
4000 for galaxies brighter than the nominal R  215 spectroscopic completeness
limit at which the cumulative redshift sampling rate is about 1 in 2 Figure 1
shows the redshift histogram for the survey and Figure 2 plots observed B  R
color vs redshift
In the present paper we discuss some preliminary results
on the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function using a subset of about
2000 R  215 galaxies from the 0223 and 0920 patches which are the 2
current patches with almost fully reduced redshift and 5-color data We adopt
H0  100 h km s1 Mpc1 and q0  05 throughout as is typically done in the
analysis of other redshift surveys at similar z
2 The Luminosity Function
The luminosity function LF of galaxies is a fundamentally important quantity
in the study of galaxy populations and their evolution Accurate determinations
of the LF at both low and high redshifts are crucial Large wide-angle redshift
surveys are providing precise measurements of the luminosity function in the
local z  0 universe eg Loveday et al 1992 Marzke et al 1994b Lin et al
1996 and smaller but deeper surveys have begun to measure the LF up to
Figure 2 B  R color vs z for CNOC2 galaxies Dotted lines show
k-corrected B  R from Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 SEDs and
solid lines show the interpolations used to subdivide CNOC2 galaxies
The vertical lines denote the redshift range 012  z  055 within
which there is unbiased coverage of spectral features important to red-
shift identication for all galaxy types
redshifts z  1 eg Lilly et al 1995 Ellis et al 1996 Cowie et al 1996 Lin et
al 1997 revealing clearly the rapid evolution of the LF of blue star-forming
galaxies but relatively little change in the LF of red more quiescent objects
Here we will examine the luminosity function and its evolution for galaxies of
dierent types in the CNOC2 sample and we will exploit the large CNOC2
sample size to derive improved constraints
Figure 3 shows the BAB-band luminosity function for a sample of 2075
galaxies with R  215 and 012  z  055 from the CNOC2 0223 and
0920 patches The LF is computed using standard inhomogeneity-independent
maximum-likelihood techniques eg Efstathiou Ellis  Peterson 1988 The
CNOC2 LF appears to be well t by a nearly-at Schechter function   08
and it is also consistent with the 02  z  05 LF from the Canada-France
Redshift Survey CFRS Lilly et al 1995 as seen in the comparison of 2 M -
 error ellipses in the Figure 3 inset Note in particular the much smaller LF
uncertainties of the CNOC2 sample which contains about ten times as many
galaxies as the CFRS over the same redshift range
However as has been observed in many previous galaxy samples the lu-
minosity function does appear to depend on various galaxy properties such as
rest-frame color spectral type or morphology see eg Lilly et al 1995 Lin
et al 1996 1997 Heyl et al 1997 Marzke et al 1994a To check the type
dependence of the LF we have also divided CNOC2 galaxies into early inter-

then clearly shows that the luminosity function depends on galaxy type with a
strong steepening of the faint-end slope  as one proceeds from red early-type
galaxies to blue late-type ones These type-dependent dierences are also quite
signicant as shown in the Figure 4 inset and are also similar to those seen in
previous smaller surveys at moderate redshifts including the CFRS Lilly et al
1995 and Autob Ellis et al 1996 samples
3 Luminosity and Number Density Evolution
So far the LFs have been t without regard to evolution but we know from
previous surveys that galaxies do evolve signicantly over z  1 As a simple but
useful parameterization of luminosity and number density evolution we adopt
the following model
z  01004P z
M z  M 0  Qz
z  0
where  is the galaxy number density P quanties the rate of number density
evolution and Q describes the rate of M  or luminosity evolution P and Q
are essentially just the linear coecents in an expansion in z of  and M 
respectively For simplicity  is assumed not to evolve so that the LF shape
does not change with redshift We use maximum-likelihood techniques to derive
best-tting LF and evolution parameters and Figure 5 shows the resulting 1
P vs Q error ellipses for the three CNOC2 galaxy types which do indeed show
dierent evolutionary trends
In particular late-type galaxies show positive
density evolution P  0 so  increases at higher z early-type galaxies show
negative density evolution P  0 and intermediate types show no density
evolution On the other hand all three galaxy types show positive luminosity
evolution ie M  is brighter in the past and the derived values of Q  1  2
are consistent with those expected from passively evolving galaxy models eg
Bruzual  Charlot 1993 Note that using q0  01 instead of q0  05 will
roughly decrease P by 08 and increase Q by 04
Also in our parameterization the luminosity density varies as Lz 
L01004P Qz  so P  Q characterizes the rate of evolution of the luminosity
density Figure 6 plots L vs z for the three galaxy types and shows the rapid
rise in the luminosity density of late-type galaxies relative to that of early- and
intermediate-type galaxies again consistent with similar trends seen in previous
smaller surveys eg Lilly et al 1996 Lin et al 1997 Finally Figure 7 com-
pares the observed CNOC2 galaxy number counts with those predicted by the
LF and evolution parameters t from the spectroscopic data alone The observed
and LF-predicted counts are in good agreement for all 5 CNOC2 bands showing
that our simple 3-population evolution model is a reasonable description and
that there are no conspicuous unaccounted spectroscopic selection eects Note
also from the R counts that our LF evolution model remains valid beyond the

in the R B I g and U bands with those computed from the LF
evolution model t to the spectroscopic sample lines Note that the
spectroscopic sample used to derive the LF evolution parameters is
limited to R  215 as indicated by the vertical line in the R panel
adopted R  215 limit of the spectroscopic sample Moreover as our galaxy
classications are based only on observed B  R colors the good match to the I
U  and g counts gives us an independent check on the validity of our LF models
However an important caveat needs to be kept in mind namely the sensi-
tivity of the LF evolution results to the precise choice of SEDs used to classify
galaxies In particular the present choice of non-evolving SEDs obviously does
not account for the color evolution of galaxies If one were to use more physi-
cally motivated evolving SEDs the resulting galaxy classications will generally
be dierent For example one can eliminate the negative density evolution of
early-type galaxies by using simple evolving models with exponentially declin-
ing star formation rates Bruzual  Charlot 1993 wherein galaxies are bluer
at higher redshifts this allows more galaxies to be classied as early-type at
higher z and thus increases the value of P  There are obviously many possi-
ble combinations of evolving SEDs that one may choose by varying parameters
such as star formation rate age metallicity or dust content Work is ongoing to
test particular evolutionary scenarios for example to see whether simple pure
luminosity evolution models no density evolution with various choices of star
formation history age etc are consistent with both the CNOC2 LF and num-
ber count data The availability of 5-color data for all CNOC2 galaxies will be
of great help here as it permits tight constraints on the SED of any particular
galaxy The LF evolution model outlined in the present paper should thus be
considered as a rst step a description of galaxy evolution within the framework
of non-evolving SEDs rather than an explanation of galaxy evolution in terms
of more physically motivated evolving models
We will also be able to constrain those physical models using additional
tools Note that there is much spectroscopic information available which will
permit measurements of star formation rates using emission line indices as well
as classication of galaxies via principal component analysis Moreover pho-
tometric redshifts can be accurately calibrated using the spectroscopic sample
and use of a larger photometric-redshift sample will help to constrain the LF
at fainter magnitudes as well as reduce errors on the P and Q parameters
Measurements of the evolution of the surface brightnesses and morphologies of
CNOC2 galaxies will also be possible Finally the environmental dependence
of luminosity and star formation properties and the relation to the evolution of
galaxy clustering will be explored using catalogs of groups and pairs of galaxies
and through measurements of the correlation function by galaxy type Ulti-
mately we hope to put clustering luminosity star formation and spectral prop-
erties together into a coherent and self-consistent picture of galaxy evolution at
moderate redshifts z  1
