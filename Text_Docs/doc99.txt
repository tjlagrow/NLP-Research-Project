Abstract
We derive the general form of Hawking temperature for Vaidya black hole in the tunneling pictures This
kind of black hole is regarded as the description of a more realistic one since its time dependent decreasing
mass due to the evaporation process Clearly the temperature would be time dependent as our ndings
We use the semiclassical methods namely radial null geodesic and complex paths methods Both methods
are found to give the same results Then we discuss the possible form of corresponding entropy

INTRODUCTION
In 1974 Hawking startled the physics community by proving that black hole evaporates particles
1 2 It contradicts with classical general relativistic denition of a black hole an object that
nothing can escape from it 3 Hawkings derivation was a quantum eld theoretically With
Hartle 22 he also derived the black hole temperature by using Feynman path integral which can
be categorized as semiclassical method but it still has such mathematical complexity Semiclassical
methods for black hole radiation 4 7 were developed in the past decade and they attract many
attentions eg Refs 15 and 16
There are two ways to perform semi-classical analysis for a black hole radiation The rst is by
the use of radial null geodesic method developed by Parikh and Wilczek 4 In this method one
has to get the expression drdt from the radial null geodesic condition ds2  d  0 for a metric
that has the form ds2  a r dt2  b r dr2  r2d2 Then the obtained expression is used to
calculate the imaginary part of the action for the process of s-wave emission and relates it to the
Boltzman factor for emission to get Hawking temperature
The second one is called complex paths method was developed by Padmanabhan etal 6 7 In
the method the scalar wave function is determined by the ansatz  r t  exp iS r th where
S r t is the action for a single scalar particle Inserting this ansatz into the Klein-Gordon equation
in a gravitational background one yields an equation for the action S r t which can be solved by
the Hamilton-Jacobi method After obtaining the action one can get the probability for outgoing
and ingoing particles P out  out2 and P in  in2 respectively The Hawking temperature
can be obtained by using the principle of detailed balance 6 7 P out  exp E P in 
exp E since all particles must be absorbed by the black hole
In this paper we consider a more general metric with the mass of black hole is time t and radius
r dependent As generally known this subject is well described by the Vaidya metric To get an
exact t  r dependence of the Hawking temperature we insist to work in using Schwarzschild like
metric for the Vaidya space time 17 rather than standard Eddington-Finkelstein metric which is
widely used for this case We derive the general form for Hawking temperature both in the radial
null geodesic and complex paths methods We arrive only at the general form since one has to get
the exact t  r dependence of mass which of course needs a specic model of the related black
hole Until now even though some models for dynamical black holes had been proposed eg Refs
23 and 24 but eorts to get better one are still performed
The organization of our paper is as follows
In the second section we will derive the Hawking
temperature for a metric with a varying mass by the use of radial null geodesic method In the
third section the Hawking temperature is obtained by the complex paths method by considering
only the lowest order expansion of action At the fourth section we show the possible expression
of entropy
In the last section we give a conclusion for our work For the rest of this paper
we use the unit dimension Newton constant light velocity in vacuum and Boltzman constant
G  c  kB  1
II RADIAL NULL GEODESIC METHOD
Previously a tightly connected work has been performed by T Clifton 8 but with dierent
method of calculations In this work we keep that the metric contains the mass of black hole as
the function of standard radius-time r  t coordinate rather than Eddington-Finkelstein radiation
coordinate u  v We start with the metric derived by Farley and DEath 17 for Vaidya space-
ds2  cid18 m
x mcid192cid181 
r cid19 dt2 cid181 
r cid191
dr2  r2d2
In the above the black hole mass m varies with time t and radius r m  m r t The x m
is an arbitrary function of mass and d2  d2  sin2 d2 is the metric of unit 2sphere We
will let the arbitrariness of x m since the determination of this function depends on the model of
corresponding black hole A short discussion of the model will be given at the last section but will
not the main subject of this paper The metric 1 has the general form
ds2  F r t dt2  G r t1 dr2  r2d2
where in our case F r t  m2x m2cid01  2mr1cid1 and G r t  1  2mr1 The general form
2 will simplify our next calculation Unless for specic purposes we will write x m F r t
and G r t as x F  and G respectively for the sake of brevity
It turns out that the metric 1 has a coordinate singularity at rh  2m which of course is time
dependent Painleve transformation that is used to remove the coordinate singularity for a metric
with time-like Killing vector is also applicable for this analysis By transforming
dt  dt s 1  G
the metric 2 changes into
ds2  F r t dt2  2Fs 1  G
dtdr  dr2  r2d2
and therefore no coordinate singularity is found Thus by such a Painleve transformation it is
understandable that in principle a coordinate singularity in general relativity can be removed only
by changing coordinate without dening new physical condition or theorem By this thought it
would be alright if we still insist in using the metric 1 for carrying out a tunneling process In
the null geodesic condition for 1  1 dimension ds2  d2  0 the radial null geodesic can be
obtained from 4 as
1  Gcid17 
where  signs denote outgoingingoing radial null geodesics
Near the horizon we can expand the coecient F and G by the use of Taylor expansion Since both
Gcid161 
F and G are t  r dependent and we only need their approximation values for short distances
from a point horizon we could apply the Taylor expansion at a xed time So we can write
F r tt  F  r tcid12cid12t r  rh  Ocid16r  rh2cid17cid12cid12cid12t
G r tt  G rh tcid12cid12t r  rh  Ocid16r  rh2cid17cid12cid12cid12t
By the approximations 6 and 7 above the dependence of radius to time in 5 can be approached
2qF  rh t G rh t r  rh 
Now we discuss the action of outgoing particle through the horizon In the original work by Parikh
and Wilczek 4 the imaginary action is written as
ImS  Im
prdr  Im
The above expression is due to the Hamilton equation drdt  dHdprr where r and pr are
canonical variables in this case the radial component of the radius and the momentum As a
reminder the action of a tunneled particle in a potential barrier higher than the energy of the
particle itself will be imaginary pr  p2m E  V  Dierent from discussions of several authors
for a static black hole mass eg Refs 4 815 21 and 22 the outgoing particles energy must be
time dependent for black holes with varying mass So the dH  integration at 9 is for all values
of outgoing particles energy say from zero to E t
By using approximation 8 we can perform the integration 9 For dr integration we can perform
a contour integration for upper half complex plane to avoid the coordinate singularity rh The result
Since the tunneling probability is given by   exph 2
factor exp E t for a system with time dependent energy we obtain
h ImSi equalizing it with the Boltzmann
2E t
pF  rh t G rh t
hpF  rh t G rh t
As seen in expression 11 the Hawking temperature TH is time dependent We will see it later
that it is also radius dependent Partial derivatives of F and G with respect to r are easily to be
found in the following forms
F  
x2 cid20mcid181 
r cid19 
x cid181 
r cid19  mcid18
r2cid19cid21 
r cid20m 
r cid21 
Inserting the values of rh  2m to the last expressions yields Hawking temperature 11 in a general
h 12  m rh t
4x rh t
In the above the m and x are written has the complete expression as m rh t and x rh t These
mean that both m and x are evaluated at rh the radius of event horizon Our nding in 12
behaves as it is expected for radius independent black hole where it means that mrh t  0 and
we get TH  h4x t which is close to an expression that had been guessed by Ashtekar long
time ago TH  h8m t
III COMPLEX PATHS METHOD
Massless scalar particles under the gravitational background g obey the Klein-Gordon equa-

For spherical symmetric black hole we may reduce our attention only to t  r sector in the
space-time or in other words we reduce to two dimensional black hole problems Later since we
are dealing with massless particle described in 13 we can employ the radial null geodesic without
Painleve transformation27 drdt  F G for outgoing and ingoing particles path Equation

By the standard ansatz for scalar wave function  r t  exph i
the equation for the action S r t

Now our next step is to solve this equation An approximation method can be applied by expanding
the action in the order of Planck constant power
S r t  S0 r t Xn
nhnSn r t
for n  1 2 3  The constant n is set to keep all the expansion terms have the actions dimension
Taking unit dimensions G  c  kB  1 n would have the dimension of m2n which m refers
to the mass It is clear that this expansion would lead to a very long equation Due to the very
small value of the Planck constant many authors 8 10 21 neglect the terms for n  1 This
consideration is acceptable and including higher terms is just adding correction for semi-classical
derivation of Hawking temperature By grouping all the terms into the same powers of h and take
the term with lowest order of Plancks constant zero power one can write
F G rS02  tS02  0
Our next task is to nd the solution for the last equation which is not too simple since our F G is
r t dependent In the standard Hamilton-Jacobi method S0 r t can be written into two parts
the time part which has the form of Et and the radius part S0 r which is in general a radius
dependent only Since our metric coecients are both radius and time dependent the standard
method would not be applicable We could generalized the method by making an ansatz
S0 r t 
Ecid0tcid1 dt  S0 r t 
At the rst sight it seems that the ansatz is rather strange that is S r t and S0 r t are both t
and r dependent The term R E t dt is more understandable since the emitted particles energy
is continuum and time dependent Let see how it works
From 18 one can write that
tS0 r t  E t  t S0 r t
rS0 r t  r S0 r t 
Since S0 r t is t and r dependent one can write
d S0 r t
 r S0 r t  t S0 r t
Eliminating dtdr by the use of drdt  F G equation 21 can be written as
d S0 r t
t S0 r t  r S0 r t 
Combining the rst equation of 17 with equations 18 and 22 where we should note that
the action equation  F G12 tS0 r t  rS0 r t is belong to outgoing particle and with the
radial evolution is drdt  F G then we could write
 F G12cid16E t  t S0 r tcid17 
d S0 r t
 F G12 t S0 r t 
From 23 we can get the exact dierentiation of S0 r t
d S0 r t
  F G12 E t 
and the solution of S0 r t can be obtained by integration
S0 r t  E tZ
The integration 25 can be evaluated by adopting the value of R F G12 dr as in obtaining
expression 10 from 9 along with its approximation method near horizon Taylor expansion
The result for the integration 25 is
S0 r t  E t
F G
The equation gives the complete action
S r t 
Ecid0tcid1 dt  E t
F G
The signs   in expression 27 refer to the action for ingoing outgoing particle
Back to our rst ansatz for scalar wave function   exph i
h S r ti the wave function for ingoing
and outgoing massless scalar particle can be read of as
in r t  exp
Ecid0tcid1 dt  E t
out r t  exp
Ecid0tcid1 dt  E t
F G
F G
respectively Consequently from 28 one can get the ingoing probability of particle as below
Pin  exp
Ecid0tcid1 dt 
E t
F G
This ingoing probability must be equal to unity since all particles including the massless one are
absorbed by the black hole This consideration gives us the relation
Ecid0tcid1 dt  
E t
F G
which leads the outgoing probability
Pout  expcid20

Finally to get the Hawking temperature from the outgoing probability 31 we equate this prob-
ability expression with exp E t which in Refs 6 and 7 is called detailed balance principle
It yields

IV GENERAL FORM OF ENTROPY
The law of black hole mechanics which expresses the conservation of energy by relating the
change in black hole mass m to the changes of its entropy Sbh angular momentum J and electric
charge Q is given by 25
dm  TH dSbh  dQ  dJ
where  is the angular velocity and  is electrostatic potential By simplifying the black hole with
no angular velocity and electrical charges one only has to pay attention on
Inserting our previous result for TH from 12 we have an integral form for entropy as
dm  TH dSbh
1  2m dm
To get an exact value of entropy which is intuitively should be equivalent to dynamical area of
black hole we must write x m m and m in their exact forms This manner would be such an
interesting work to be pursued further
V SUMMARY
To summarize our ndings above we can state that we have derived a general expression for
Hawking temperature up to the model function x m and partial derivative of black hole mass
with respect to radius at 11 and 12 in two dierent semiclassical approaches null geodesic
and complex paths methods for a Vaidya black hole This kind of black hole is regarded as the
description of a more realistic one since its time dependent decreasing mass due to the evaporation
process Clearly the temperature would be time dependent as our ndings Both methods are
found to give the same results Then we discuss he possible general form of discussed black hole
entropy 35 This last nding perhaps can be compared to some models that had been proposed
eg Refs 23 and 24
