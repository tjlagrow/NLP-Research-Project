CENTRAL LIMIT THEOREM FOR NONLINEAR HAWKES
PROCESSES
LINGJIONG ZHU
Abstract Hawkes process is a self-exciting point process with clustering ef-
fect whose intensity depends on its entire past history It has wide applica-
tions in neuroscience nance and many other elds In this paper we obtain a
functional central limit theorem for nonlinear Hawkes process Under the same
assumptions we also obtain a Strassens invariance principle ie a functional
law of the iterated logarithm
1 Introduction and Main Results
11 Introduction Hawkes process is a self-exciting simple point process rst in-
troduced by Hawkes 9 The future evolution of a self-exciting point process is
inuenced by the timing of past events The process is non-Markovian except for
some very special cases In other words Hawkes process depends on the entire past
history and has a long memory Hawkes process has wide applications in neuro-
science seismology genome analysis nance and many other elds It has both
self-exciting and clustering properties which is very appealing to some nancial
applications According to Errais et al
8 The collapse of Lehman Brothers
brought the nancial system to the brink of a breakdown The dramatic repercus-
sions point to the exisence of feedback phenomena that are channeled through the
complex web of informational and contractual relationships in the economy This
and related episodes motivate the design of models of correlated default timing that
incorporate the feedback phenomena that plague credit markets The self-exciting
and clustering properties of Hawkes process make it a viable candidate in modeling
the correlated defaults and evaluating the credit derivatives in nance for example
see Errais et al 8 and Dassios and Zhao 6
Most of the literature of Hawkes processes studies only the linear case which has
an immigration-birth representation see Hawkes and Oakes 10 The stability
law of large numbers central limit theorem large deviations Bartlett spectrum etc
have all been studied and well understood Almost all of the applications of Hawkes
process in the literatures consider exclusively the linear case Because of the lack of
immigration-birth representation and computational tractability nonlinear Hawkes
process is much less studied However some eorts have already been made in this
direction For instance see Bremaud and Massoulie 3 Zhu 14 and Zhu 15 In
this paper we will prove a functional central limit theorem for nonlinear Hawkes

let Ft

for all intervals a b is called an Ft
A general Hawkes process is a simple point process N admitting an Ft

In the literature h and  are usually referred to as exciting function and
A Hawkes process is linear if  is linear and it is nonlinear otherwise
Bremaud and Massoulie 3 proved that under the assumption that  is -
Lipschitz with khkL1  1 there exists a unique stationary and ergodic version of
Hawkes process satisfying the dynamics 12
Bremaud and Massoulie 3 studied the stability of nonlinear Hawkes process
in great details including existence uniqueness stability in distribution and in
variation etc
Later Bremaud et al
4 studied the rate of convergence of nonlinar Hawkes
process to its stationary version
13 Limit Theorems for Hawkes Processes When  is linear say z 
  z for some   0 and khkL1  1 Hawkes process has a very nice immigration-
birth representation see for example Hawkes and Oakes 10 For the linear Hawkes
process limit theorems are very well understood There is the law of large numbers

Recently Bacry et al

multivariate Hawkes process under certain assumptions That includes the linear
Hawkes process as a special case and they proved that
Nt  t

where B is a standard Brownian motion The convergence is weak convergence on

Very recently Karabash and Zhu 12 obtained central limit theorem and large
deviation principle for the linear Hawkes process with random marks In a nutshell
the linear Hawkes process satises very nice limit theroems and the limits can be
computed more or less explicitly
On the contrary when  is nonlinear the usual immigration-birth representa-
tion no longer works and you may have to use some abstract theory to obtain limit
theorems Some progress has already been made for nonlinear Hawkes process
Bremaud and Massoulie 3s stability result implies that by the erogdic theorem
t    EN 0 1
as t   where EN 0 1 is the mean of N 0 1 under the stationary and ergodic
measure
When h is exponential and  is nonlinear the Hawkes process is Markovian
and Zhu 14 obtained a large deviation principle for Ntt   in this case Zhu
14 also proved the large deviation principle for the case when h is a sum of
exponentials and used that as an approximation to recover the result for the linear
case proved in Bordenave and Torrisi 2
For the most general h and  Zhu 15 proved a process-level ie
level-3
large deviation principle for the Hawkes process and used contraction principle to
obtain a large deviation principle for Ntt  
law of the iterated logarithm for nonlinear Hawkes process
In this paper we will prove a functional central limit theorem and a functional
14 Main Results The following is the assumption we will use throughout this
Assumption 1 We assume that
thtdt  
 h  0  R is a decreasing function and R 
  is positive and increasing and -Lipschitz ie x y  x y
for any x y such that khkL1  1
Bremaud and Massoulie 3 proved that if  is -Lipschitz with khkL1  1
there exists a unique stationary and ergodic Hawkes process satisfying the dynamics
12 Hence under our Assumption 1 which is slightly stronger than 3 there
exists a unique stationary and ergodic Hawkes process satisfying the dynamics 12
Let P and E denote the probability measure and expectation for a stationary
ergodic Hawkes process and let PF0
 denote the conditional
probability measure and conditional expectation for the Hawkes process given the
past history
 and EF0

The following are the main results of this paper
Theorem 1 Under Assumption 1 let N be the stationary and ergodic nonlinear
Hawkes process with dynamics 12 We have
Nt  t

where B is a standard Brownian motion and 0     where

EN 0 1  N j j  1  
The convergence in 18 is weak convergence on D0 1 the space of cadlag func-
tions on 0 1 equipped with Skorokhod topology
Remark 1 By a standard central limit theorem for martingales ie Theoerem 4
it is easy to see that

In the linear case say z    z Bacry et al
 That is not

surprising because Nt  t should have more uctuations than Nt R t
0 sds
Therefore we guess that for nonlinear  2 dened in 19 should also satisfy
2    EN 0 1 However it might not be very easy to compute and say
something about 2 in such a case

2 Proofs
This section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 1 We use a standard central
limit theorem ie Theorem 3 In our proof we need the fact that EN 0 12  
which is proved in Lemma 2 Lemma 2 is proved by proving a stronger result rst
ie Lemma 1 We will also prove Lemma 3 to guarantee that   0 so that the
central limit theorem is not degenerate
Let us rst quote the two necessary central limit theorems from Billingsley 7

the weak convergence is on D0 1 equipped with the Skorohod topology

Now we are ready to prove our main result
Proof of Theorem 1 Since in the stationary regime EN n n  1  EN 0 1 for
any n  Z and let us denote EN 0 1   In order to apply Theorem 3 let us
rst prove that

Let E1 N n n  1 and E2 N n n  1 be two independent copies of EN n n

because under Assumption 1
where EN n n  1 denotes the expectation of the number of points in n n 
1 for the Hawkes process with the same dynamics 12 and empty history ie
N  0  0
Next let us estimate E1 N n n  1  EN n n  1 E1 N n n  1 is
the expectation of the number of points in n n  1 for the Hawkes process with
intensity t  cid16P 1 0t ht   cid17 It is well dened for ae 1 under P

which implies that t   P-as
It is clear that E1 N n n  1  EN n n  1 almost surely so we can use
a coupling method to estimate the dierence We will follow the ideas in Bremaud
and Massoulie 3 using the Poisson embedding method Consider F P the
canonical space of a point process on R  R in which N is Poisson with intensity

history and intensity 0

Following the arguments as in Bremaud and Massoulie 3 we know that each n
is an F N
is the -algebra generated by N up to time
t By our Assumption 1  is increasing and it is clear that nt and N nC
increase in n for all t  R and C  BR Thus Dn is well dened and also that
as n   the limiting processes t and N exist N counts the number of points of
N below the curve t 7 t and admits t as an F N

Letting n   it is valid since we assume that  is Lipschitz and thus continu-
ous we conclude that N  t satises the dynamics 12 Therefore with intensity
t N  N 0 Pi1 Di is the Hawkes process with past history 1 
We can then estimate the dierence by noticing that

Here EP means the expectation with respect to P the probability measure on the

where the rst equality in 211 is due to the construction of D1 in 27 the
second equality in 211 is due to the denitions of 1 and 0 in 27 and nally
the inequality in 211 is due to the fact that  is -Lipschitz by Assumption 1
