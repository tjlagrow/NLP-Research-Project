ABSTRACT 
UNL  system  is  designed  and  implemented by  a  nonprofit organization  UNDL  Foundation  at  Geneva  in 
1999  UNL  applications  are  application  softwares  that  allow  end  users  to  accomplish  natural  language 
tasks  such  as translating  summarizing  retrieving or  extracting  information  etc  Two  major  web  based 
application  softwares  are  Interactive  ANalyzer  IAN  which  is  a  natural  language  analysis  system  It 
represents  natural  language  sentences  as  semantic  networks  in  the  UNL  format  Other  application 
software  is  dEep-to-sUrface  GENErator  EUGENE  which  is  an  open-source  interactive  NLizer  It 
generates  natural  language  sentences  out  of  semantic  networks  represented  in  the  UNL  format  In  this 
paper NLization framework with EUGENE is focused while using UNL system for accomplishing the task 
of machine translation In whole NLization process EUGENE takes a UNL input and delivers an output in 
natural language without any human intervention It is language-independent and has to be parametrized 
to  the  natural  language  input  through  a  dictionary  and  a  grammar  provided  as  separate  interpretable 
files In this paper it is explained that how UNL input is syntactically and semantically analyzed with the 
UNL-NL  T-Grammar  for  NLization  of  UNL  sentences  involving  verbs  pronouns  and  determiners  for 
Punjabi natural language

1 INTRODUCTION 
Today all over the world work is in progress by  various governmenteducational organizations 
and  some  individual  researchers  for  technological  development  of  most  widely  spoken  natural 
languages  Machine  Translation  is  most  challenging  task  which  is  to  be  accomplished  before 
excelling  further  in  other  sub  domains  of  NLP  Natural  Language  Processing  The  process  of 
translating  a  text  written  in  some  language  to  another  languages  text  is  called  Machine 
Translation  
There are many approaches used for machine translation Interlingua based approach which is a 
rule based can be adopted for multilingual machine translation as depicted in Figure 1 
In  this  approach  the  target  language  is  first  transformed  into  some  intermediate  form  while 
preserving  the  semantic  information  associated  with  the  words  of  source  language  This 
intermediate  form  is  independent  of  source  language  From  this  intermediate  form  variety  of 
natural  languages  can  be  generated  by  a  separate  process  using  respective  language  word 
dictionaries and sets of grammar rules If traditional statistical approach is followed then total of 
nn-1 systems will be required for n number of languages in multilingual machine translation 
But  interlingua  approach  for  machine  translation  system  is  a  novel  approach  here  only  2n 
language systems are required ie two systems per language 
Figure 1  Model of Interlingual based Machine Translation 
Universal  Networking  Language  ie  UNL  system  is  based  on  interlingua  approach 
UNL  system  is  designed  and  implemented  by  UNDL  foundation  which  is  a  non-profit 
organization based in Geneva Switzerland in 1996 UNL system comprises of two components 
one  is  UNLizer  for  converting  the  source  language  to  UNL  form  an  intermediate  form  and 
other is NLizer for generating target language from UNL form using respective language word 
dictionaries  and  sets  of  grammar  rules  UNLization  and  NLization  are  different  for  different 
languages because sentence structures of different languages are different 
In this paper NLization for Punjabi language    for  verb  pronouns and determiners from UNL 
form  an  intermediate  form  is  discussed  EUGENE  dEep-to-sUrface  Natural  language 
GENErator is an open-source interactive NLizer which is a new deconverter based on a high-
level  linguist-driven  three-layered  formalism  developed  by  UNDL  Foundation  It  generates 
natural  language  sentences  out  of  semantic  networks  represented  in  the  UNL  format  In  its 
current release it is a web application developed in Java 1 
2 RELATED WORK 
Initially DeCo was a tool  for NLization which was proposed by UNDL  foundation in 2000 
This  DeConverter  actually  transforms  the  input  a  UNL  expression  into  a  directed  graph 
structure  with  hyper-nodes  DeConversion  of  a  UNL  expression  is  carried  out  by  applying 
DeConversion  rules  to  these  nodes  It  processes  the  nodes  from  the  entry  node  to  find  an 
appropriate  word  for  each  node  and  generates  a  word  sequence  of  target  language  In  this 
process  the  system  makes  use  of  syntactic  rules  in  order  to  produce  syntactic  structure  of  the 
target  language  and  morphological  rules  to  generate  its  morphemes  as  depicted  in  Figure  2 
DeConversion  process  ends  when  all  words  for  all  nodes  are  found  and  a  word  sequence  of 
target sentence is completed  
Figure 2  Structure of the DeConverter 2 
Here  G  indicates  generation  windows  and  C  indicates  condition  windows  of  the 
DeConverter The DeConverter operates on the node-list through generation windows Condition 
windows are used to check conditions for applying a rule In the initial stage the entry node of a 
UNL expression exists in the node-list and at the end of DeConversion the node-list is converted 
to list of equivalent morphemes  of the target language arranged syntactically to  produce target 
language sentence 2 
3 EUGENE SPECIFICATIONS 
 EUGENE  is  a  fully  automatic  engine  It  takes  a  UNL  input  and  delivers  an  output  in 
natural  language  without  any  human  intervention  3  It  is  language-independent  and  as  a 
universal  engine  EUGENE  must  be  parameterized  to  the  target  languages  with  few  files  for 
UNL-NL generation These files are processed by EUGENE through following tabs 
31 UNL Input 
UNL Documents containing universal semantic network to be used for the generation of natural 
language texts are inputted into the system using first tab of EUGENE 
32 Dictionary 
An  editor  and  for  inputting  a  lexical  database  where root  words are  mapped  into  natural 
language  entries  along  with  the  corresponding  features  to  be  provided  according  to  the UNL 
Dictionary Specifications  
33 T-Rules 
An  editor  and  inputting  transformation  grammars  ie  a  set  of  transformation  rules  used  to 
convert the UNL  graphs into natural language sentences to be  provided according to the UNL 
Grammar Specifications 
34 D-Rules 
An editor and for inputting disambiguation grammars  ie a set of disambiguation rules used 
to improve the results of the tokenization and of the transformation 
35 EUGENE 
A  console  from  where  the  output  corresponding  to  the  UNL  input  sentence  can  be  generated 
The out can be displayed in five different trace levels It takes a UNL input processes it using T-
rules and Dictionary loaded finally delivers an output in natural language without any human 
intervention 
In the next subsection features of Punjabi language and positioning of different part of speech in 
a sentence of Punjabi language discussed in brief  
4 FUTURE OF PUNJABI LANGUAGE 
Punjabi  is  an  Indo-Aryan  language  and  is  constitutionally  recognized  language  of  India  Indo-
Aryan languages form a subgroup of the Indo-Iranian group of languages which in turn belong 
to  Indo-European  family of languages Punjabi is widely spoken in north-west  India Pakistan 
United States  Australia  United  Kingdom  and  Canada  There  are  more  than  91  million  native 
speakers  of  Punjabi  language  which  makes  it  approximately  the  12th  most  widely  spoken 
language in the world 4 
Punjabi has word classes in the form of noun pronoun adjective cardinal ordinal main verb 
auxiliary verb adverb postposition conjunction interjection and particle Punjabi nouns change 
forms for number singular or plural and case in sentences Punjabi nouns have assigned gender 
masculine or feminine eg  kandh fence is used in feminine gender and  mz table 
is  used  in  masculine  gender Punjabi has  six  types  of  pronouns  These  are  personal  pronouns 
eg   mai  i  reflexive  pronouns  eg   p  some  what  equivalent  to honorific  form  of 
English second person  you demonstrative pronouns  eg  uh that indefinite pronouns 
eg  k etc relative pronouns to join two clauses in a complex sentence  eg  j and 
interrogative pronouns  eg  kau whoetc In Punjabi language adjectives usually precede 
the  nouns  but  follow  the  pronouns  The  example  of  adjective  preceding  noun  is    
 
sh mu handsome boy and the example of adjective following pronoun is    
 mai sh h I am handsome In a Punjabi sentence verbs must agree with the subject 
or object of the sentence in terms of gender number and person Punjabi verbs change forms for 
gender number person and tense The verbs have assigned transitivity and causality In Punjabi 
there  are  two  auxiliary  verbs     hai  for  present  tense  eg       rm  amb 
khnd hai Ram eats mango and  s for past tense eg        rm n 
amb khdh s Ram had eaten mango All the forms of these two auxiliary verbs can equally 
be used for both the genders 2 For future tense in sentences EGA form of main verb is used 
and in those sentences auxiliary 
5 IMPLEMENTATION FOR NLIZATION OF PUNJABI 
The  proposed  NLization  system  for  Punjabi  has  been  tested  on  five  types  of  part  of  speech 
sentences which are Determiners Nouns Verbs Pronouns Sentence Structure and Cardinals 
Here in this paper NLization for Determiners Verbs and Pronouns types of parts of speech are 
discussed  Table  1  depicts  the  number  T-rules  and  Dictionary  words  written  corresponding  to 
each type of part of speech

6 RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
In  this  paper  it  is  described  in  detail  that  how  UNL  input  sentence  can  be  converted  into 
Punjabi natural language for Determiners Verbs and Pronouns phrases using dictionary words 
and  T-rules  in  the  EUGENE  console  5  As  a  whole  near  about  140  sentences  are  processed 
successfully  with  exact  desired  output  All  other  sentences  which  fall  in  these  three  categories 
can also be processed easily by same set of written rules and by appending new dictionary words 
to the respective dictionaries  
There is a feature available on the UNDL foundations website which is  F-measure 6 which 
rates  the  output  of  NLization  output  generated  using  EUGENE  tool  with  the  actual  expected 
Punjabi natural langauge sentences on the scale of 0-1 We can upload both the files saved in 
UTF-8 txt format and this gives us F-measure for it F-measure for all the processed sentences is 
come out to be more than 90 as depicted in Figure 3  
Figure 3  Combined F-measure for determiners pronouns and verbs 7 
7 CONCLUSIONS 
Many issues come while processing these UNL sentences some changes  made in the rules for 
the  later  sentences  may  cause  the  earlier  sentences  to  get  effected  Every  time  care  should  be 
taken while making changes to the rules for creating generalized rule sets So writing the rules 
and editing them according to the grammar and sentence structure in Punjabi natural language is 
bit tedious task but once the rules and dictionary gets written we can process all other sentences 
which fall in these categories EUGENE tool is very effective tool for accomplishing this task It 
has  very  high  quality  because  of  its  quality  features  like  high  availability  usability  high 
performance due to these features changes and crosschecking of sentences can be made readily

ABSTRACT 
UNL  system  is  designed  and  implemented by  a  nonprofit organization  UNDL  Foundation  at  Geneva  in 
1999  UNL  applications  are  application  softwares  that  allow  end  users  to  accomplish  natural  language 
tasks  such  as translating  summarizing  retrieving or  extracting  information  etc  Two  major  web  based 
application  softwares  are  Interactive  ANalyzer  IAN  which  is  a  natural  language  analysis  system  It 
represents  natural  language  sentences  as  semantic  networks  in  the  UNL  format  Other  application 
software  is  dEep-to-sUrface  GENErator  EUGENE  which  is  an  open-source  interactive  NLizer  It 
generates  natural  language  sentences  out  of  semantic  networks  represented  in  the  UNL  format  In  this 
paper NLization framework with EUGENE is focused while using UNL system for accomplishing the task 
of machine translation In whole NLization process EUGENE takes a UNL input and delivers an output in 
natural language without any human intervention It is language-independent and has to be parametrized 
to  the  natural  language  input  through  a  dictionary  and  a  grammar  provided  as  separate  interpretable 
files In this paper it is explained that how UNL input is syntactically and semantically analyzed with the 
UNL-NL  T-Grammar  for  NLization  of  UNL  sentences  involving  verbs  pronouns  and  determiners  for 
Punjabi natural language

1 INTRODUCTION 
Today all over the world work is in progress by  various governmenteducational organizations 
and  some  individual  researchers  for  technological  development  of  most  widely  spoken  natural 
languages  Machine  Translation  is  most  challenging  task  which  is  to  be  accomplished  before 
excelling  further  in  other  sub  domains  of  NLP  Natural  Language  Processing  The  process  of 
translating  a  text  written  in  some  language  to  another  languages  text  is  called  Machine 
Translation  
There are many approaches used for machine translation Interlingua based approach which is a 
rule based can be adopted for multilingual machine translation as depicted in Figure 1 
In  this  approach  the  target  language  is  first  transformed  into  some  intermediate  form  while 
preserving  the  semantic  information  associated  with  the  words  of  source  language  This 
intermediate  form  is  independent  of  source  language  From  this  intermediate  form  variety  of 
natural  languages  can  be  generated  by  a  separate  process  using  respective  language  word 
dictionaries and sets of grammar rules If traditional statistical approach is followed then total of 
nn-1 systems will be required for n number of languages in multilingual machine translation 
But  interlingua  approach  for  machine  translation  system  is  a  novel  approach  here  only  2n 
language systems are required ie two systems per language 
Figure 1  Model of Interlingual based Machine Translation 
Universal  Networking  Language  ie  UNL  system  is  based  on  interlingua  approach 
UNL  system  is  designed  and  implemented  by  UNDL  foundation  which  is  a  non-profit 
organization based in Geneva Switzerland in 1996 UNL system comprises of two components 
one  is  UNLizer  for  converting  the  source  language  to  UNL  form  an  intermediate  form  and 
other is NLizer for generating target language from UNL form using respective language word 
dictionaries  and  sets  of  grammar  rules  UNLization  and  NLization  are  different  for  different 
languages because sentence structures of different languages are different 
In this paper NLization for Punjabi language    for  verb  pronouns and determiners from UNL 
form  an  intermediate  form  is  discussed  EUGENE  dEep-to-sUrface  Natural  language 
GENErator is an open-source interactive NLizer which is a new deconverter based on a high-
level  linguist-driven  three-layered  formalism  developed  by  UNDL  Foundation  It  generates 
natural  language  sentences  out  of  semantic  networks  represented  in  the  UNL  format  In  its 
current release it is a web application developed in Java 1 
2 RELATED WORK 
Initially DeCo was a tool  for NLization which was proposed by UNDL  foundation in 2000 
This  DeConverter  actually  transforms  the  input  a  UNL  expression  into  a  directed  graph 
structure  with  hyper-nodes  DeConversion  of  a  UNL  expression  is  carried  out  by  applying 
DeConversion  rules  to  these  nodes  It  processes  the  nodes  from  the  entry  node  to  find  an 
appropriate  word  for  each  node  and  generates  a  word  sequence  of  target  language  In  this 
process  the  system  makes  use  of  syntactic  rules  in  order  to  produce  syntactic  structure  of  the 
target  language  and  morphological  rules  to  generate  its  morphemes  as  depicted  in  Figure  2 
DeConversion  process  ends  when  all  words  for  all  nodes  are  found  and  a  word  sequence  of 
target sentence is completed  
Figure 2  Structure of the DeConverter 2 
Here  G  indicates  generation  windows  and  C  indicates  condition  windows  of  the 
DeConverter The DeConverter operates on the node-list through generation windows Condition 
windows are used to check conditions for applying a rule In the initial stage the entry node of a 
UNL expression exists in the node-list and at the end of DeConversion the node-list is converted 
to list of equivalent morphemes  of the target language arranged syntactically to  produce target 
language sentence 2 
3 EUGENE SPECIFICATIONS 
 EUGENE  is  a  fully  automatic  engine  It  takes  a  UNL  input  and  delivers  an  output  in 
natural  language  without  any  human  intervention  3  It  is  language-independent  and  as  a 
universal  engine  EUGENE  must  be  parameterized  to  the  target  languages  with  few  files  for 
UNL-NL generation These files are processed by EUGENE through following tabs 
31 UNL Input 
UNL Documents containing universal semantic network to be used for the generation of natural 
language texts are inputted into the system using first tab of EUGENE 
32 Dictionary 
An  editor  and  for  inputting  a  lexical  database  where root  words are  mapped  into  natural 
language  entries  along  with  the  corresponding  features  to  be  provided  according  to  the UNL 
Dictionary Specifications  
33 T-Rules 
An  editor  and  inputting  transformation  grammars  ie  a  set  of  transformation  rules  used  to 
convert the UNL  graphs into natural language sentences to be  provided according to the UNL 
Grammar Specifications 
34 D-Rules 
An editor and for inputting disambiguation grammars  ie a set of disambiguation rules used 
to improve the results of the tokenization and of the transformation 
35 EUGENE 
A  console  from  where  the  output  corresponding  to  the  UNL  input  sentence  can  be  generated 
The out can be displayed in five different trace levels It takes a UNL input processes it using T-
rules and Dictionary loaded finally delivers an output in natural language without any human 
intervention 
In the next subsection features of Punjabi language and positioning of different part of speech in 
a sentence of Punjabi language discussed in brief  
4 FUTURE OF PUNJABI LANGUAGE 
Punjabi  is  an  Indo-Aryan  language  and  is  constitutionally  recognized  language  of  India  Indo-
Aryan languages form a subgroup of the Indo-Iranian group of languages which in turn belong 
to  Indo-European  family of languages Punjabi is widely spoken in north-west  India Pakistan 
United States  Australia  United  Kingdom  and  Canada  There  are  more  than  91  million  native 
speakers  of  Punjabi  language  which  makes  it  approximately  the  12th  most  widely  spoken 
language in the world 4 
Punjabi has word classes in the form of noun pronoun adjective cardinal ordinal main verb 
auxiliary verb adverb postposition conjunction interjection and particle Punjabi nouns change 
forms for number singular or plural and case in sentences Punjabi nouns have assigned gender 
masculine or feminine eg  kandh fence is used in feminine gender and  mz table 
is  used  in  masculine  gender Punjabi has  six  types  of  pronouns  These  are  personal  pronouns 
eg   mai  i  reflexive  pronouns  eg   p  some  what  equivalent  to honorific  form  of 
English second person  you demonstrative pronouns  eg  uh that indefinite pronouns 
eg  k etc relative pronouns to join two clauses in a complex sentence  eg  j and 
interrogative pronouns  eg  kau whoetc In Punjabi language adjectives usually precede 
the  nouns  but  follow  the  pronouns  The  example  of  adjective  preceding  noun  is    
 
sh mu handsome boy and the example of adjective following pronoun is    
 mai sh h I am handsome In a Punjabi sentence verbs must agree with the subject 
or object of the sentence in terms of gender number and person Punjabi verbs change forms for 
gender number person and tense The verbs have assigned transitivity and causality In Punjabi 
there  are  two  auxiliary  verbs     hai  for  present  tense  eg       rm  amb 
khnd hai Ram eats mango and  s for past tense eg        rm n 
amb khdh s Ram had eaten mango All the forms of these two auxiliary verbs can equally 
be used for both the genders 2 For future tense in sentences EGA form of main verb is used 
and in those sentences auxiliary 
5 IMPLEMENTATION FOR NLIZATION OF PUNJABI 
The  proposed  NLization  system  for  Punjabi  has  been  tested  on  five  types  of  part  of  speech 
sentences which are Determiners Nouns Verbs Pronouns Sentence Structure and Cardinals 
Here in this paper NLization for Determiners Verbs and Pronouns types of parts of speech are 
discussed  Table  1  depicts  the  number  T-rules  and  Dictionary  words  written  corresponding  to 
each type of part of speech

6 RESULT AND DISCUSSION  
In  this  paper  it  is  described  in  detail  that  how  UNL  input  sentence  can  be  converted  into 
Punjabi natural language for Determiners Verbs and Pronouns phrases using dictionary words 
and  T-rules  in  the  EUGENE  console  5  As  a  whole  near  about  140  sentences  are  processed 
successfully  with  exact  desired  output  All  other  sentences  which  fall  in  these  three  categories 
can also be processed easily by same set of written rules and by appending new dictionary words 
to the respective dictionaries  
There is a feature available on the UNDL foundations website which is  F-measure 6 which 
rates  the  output  of  NLization  output  generated  using  EUGENE  tool  with  the  actual  expected 
Punjabi natural langauge sentences on the scale of 0-1 We can upload both the files saved in 
UTF-8 txt format and this gives us F-measure for it F-measure for all the processed sentences is 
come out to be more than 90 as depicted in Figure 3  
Figure 3  Combined F-measure for determiners pronouns and verbs 7 
7 CONCLUSIONS 
Many issues come while processing these UNL sentences some changes  made in the rules for 
the  later  sentences  may  cause  the  earlier  sentences  to  get  effected  Every  time  care  should  be 
taken while making changes to the rules for creating generalized rule sets So writing the rules 
and editing them according to the grammar and sentence structure in Punjabi natural language is 
bit tedious task but once the rules and dictionary gets written we can process all other sentences 
which fall in these categories EUGENE tool is very effective tool for accomplishing this task It 
has  very  high  quality  because  of  its  quality  features  like  high  availability  usability  high 
performance due to these features changes and crosschecking of sentences can be made readily
