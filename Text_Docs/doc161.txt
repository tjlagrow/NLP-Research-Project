Abstract We present a model of chemical and spectrophotometric evolution
of disk galaxies based on a stochastic self-propagating star formation scenario
The model incorporates galaxy formation through the process of accretion

ulations SSP and parameterized gas dynamics inside the model The model
reproduces observational data of a late-type spiral galaxy M 33 reasonably well
Promising test results prove the applicability of the model and the adequate
accuracy for the interpretation of disk galaxy properties

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the recent decades galaxy evolution models became sophisticated and
based on large state of art codes Hensler 2009 Despite this the main processes
controlling the evolution of galaxies eg star formation rate and star formation
feedback must be taken into account more carefully Therefore there are still
advantages of using relatively simple models of galactic evolution based on param-
eterized physical processes Due to the fast computation of these models one can
explore a wide range of galactic parameters and galaxy properties
A part of such simple models apply a stochastic self-propagating star forma-
tion SSPSF scenario which has been used with success to explain the occulent
spiral patterns in late-type disk galaxies Gerola  Seiden 1978 Initially these
models were applied to explain galactic disk spiral patterns by applying the perco-
lation phenomena to star formation propagation More advanced models include
gaseous disks and perform galaxy modeling self-consistently Successful attempts
have been made to explain properties of dwarf galaxies Gerola et al 1980 have
explained a highly diverse star formation rate in these systems as a characteristic
behavior of SSPSF models on a spatially small disk SSPSF models were developed
further by introducing anisotropic propagating star formation probabilities to ac-
count for dierent galaxy morphologies Jungwiert  Palous 1994 and physical
groundings for the self-propagating star formation process Palous et al 1994
By incorporating SSPSF ideas into the models of disk galaxy evolution Sleath
 Alexander 1995 were able to reproduce the Kennicutt-Schmidt law Kenni-
cutt 1998 Later on following a rapid evolution of computational power galaxy
T Mineikis V Vansevicius
evolution models have been developed mainly by applying N-body methods
We have developed a model based on the ideas of Seiden  Gerola 1982 with
updated input physics and modern-day knowledge of the star formation process in
disk galaxies This model was applied to interpret observational data of the M 33
galaxy
2 THE MODEL
We use the disk galaxy model scheme proposed by Seiden  Gerola 1982 and
supplement it with a prescription of physical processes characterizing star forma-
tion and galaxy evolution The disk of a galaxy is subdivided into regions cells
of characteristic size which to some degree are independent entities evolving ac-
cording to chemical evolution scenarios The most practical representation of such
a disk structure is a two dimensional 2-D polar grid Figure 1 which makes the
implementation of the galaxy rotation curve simple and produces realistic galaxy
disk models
Fig 1 The galaxy disk model subdivided into cells The neighboring cells open
circles to a cell under consideration lled circle and the fraction of its perimeter ij
contacting with a particular neighbor are marked
21 Model geometry
A galaxy is approximated by a 2-D disk subdivided into concentric rings of the
same width see Figure 1 A ring with a running number i contains 6i cells This
division produces cells of the same area and perimeter except for the central cell
with an area smaller by a factor of 34 Cells are the basic structure elements in
the model The main parameter describing galactic disks is the number of rings
Each ring rotates according to a given rotation curve which remains constant
during the simulation procedure
22 Disk formation
The simulated galaxy consists of two main parts ie the galaxy itself and
the reservoir where all the gas is initially located The galaxy formation proceeds
gradually by accreting gas from the reservoir The rate of accretion onto the galaxy
disk At R gradually decreases in time and is assumed to be proportional to gas

At R  A0 R  expcid18
acccid19 
where acc is an accretion timescale and A0 R is an initial accretion rate at the
galactocentric distance R
23 Star formation prescription
A cell is able to experience star formation events SF events of two types
spontaneous and stimulated The spontaneous star formation process is assumed
to be related to collisions of giant molecular clouds GMCs However we do not
consider the formation of GMCs explicitly and assume that the number of GMC
collisions in the cell is proportional to 2
gasi Therefore the likelihood that a cell
experiences a spontaneous SF event is proportional to gasiSP2 where SP
is a parameter controlling spontaneous star formation assumed to be equal to
320 M pc2 ie double the density of GMCs in M 33 Bolatto et al 2008
Stimulated star formation occurs when the cell i which forms stars in the
present time step induces SF events in the neighboring cells during the next
time step This process can be parameterized by the likelihood of stimulated star
formation LST dened as the average number of new cells in which SF events can
be induced by the SF event in the i cell Therefore the likelihood of stimulated
star formation in the neighboring cell j is proportional to LST  ij where ij
is the fraction of the i cells perimeter contacting the cell j see Figure 1 In our
model we assume LST  2 Seiden  Gerola 1982
Galaxy disks gradually grow due to gas accretion therefore initially within
the entire galaxy and later on at the disk edge star formation is weak due to the
critical gas surface density C which is assumed for star formation This density
reduces the likelihood of a SF event by a factor of gasiC where gasi is the
average gas surface density of a particular cell
Schaye 2004 models support the critical surface gas density C  310 M
pc2 independent of the galactocentric distance We applied C  7 M pc2 a
value adopted for the investigation of the disk evolution in our Galaxy Chiappini
et al 2001
During a SF event in a cell lasting one time step eg 10 Myr the fraction of
gas converted to stars is dened by star formation eciency 
  0 cid18 gasi
gas0cid19 
where 0 is the eciency of star formation at a gas surface density used for cali-
bration gas0 A linear dependency on gasi for self-regulated star formation was
suggested by Koppen et al 1995 In our model we assume gas0  10 M pc2
derived for the Milky Way galaxy Wolre et al 2003 which produces the ob-
served star formation eciency in GMCs Myers et al 1986 0  002
In the next time step after a SF event in the cell star formation ceases due to
the energy injected by high-mass stars Another SF event in the same cell becomes
highly improbable since some time the refractory time is needed to settle and cool
the disturbed hot gas Throughout the simulation we use a constant refractory

24 Chemical evolution
The cells in the galaxy model experience discrete star formation bursts During
the burst in a particular cell gas considered to be well-mixed within the cell is
converted into stars and the formed stellar population can be represented satis-
factorily by a simple stellar population SSP approach Using SSP properties
calculated with the PEGASE software v 20 Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange 1997
see Table 1 for the parameters and following the track of a cells star formation
history we compute the chemical evolution of the cell i The equation of chemical
evolution includes the three main contributions
Zi  gasi
 At R  Z0 Xj
Fij  Zij Xk
Gik  Zik
Here the left-hand side represents the change in the metal content of the cell i
The rst right-hand side term is a contribution by the accreted primordial gas with
metallicity Z0 from the reservoir at the galactocentric distance R The second term
is a sum of gas ows Fij from all neighboring cells to the cell i see below The
last term is the sum of metal contributions through all SSPs formed in the cell
i Gik is the expelled gas from stars in the stellar population k with metallicity

25 Gas dynamics
The galactic disk model subdivided into isolated cells of  100 pc in size would
be an unrealistic approach as typical multi-supernovae powered super-bubbles
reach a similar size eg Chu 2008 The isolated cells could also lead in some
cases to the highly inhomogeneous metallicity of interstellar matter in galaxy disks
which clearly contradicts observations Scalo  Elmegreen 2004
The gas dynamics implemented in our model is based on assumptions that
the equilibrium gas distribution is dened by an exponential disk scale length
and that every SF event in a cell is powerful enough to inate a super-bubble
beyond the cells boundaries leaving in it only the rareed gas of high temperature
Assuming the initial mass function IMF see Table 1 and the energy released
by supernovae ESN  1044 J the super-bubble radius after 10 Myr is equal to
 140 pc McCray  Kafatos 1987 at the edge of the star forming disk gasi 
7 M pc2 This proves that SF events in the cells are powerful enough to drive
Disk galaxy SSPSF models
inter-cell gas dynamics As a consequence the gas owing from the cell i to
the cell j is proportional to the mass of gas in the cell i and the fraction of its
perimeter contacting the cell j Fij  mgasi  ij 
The cavity in the cell i produced by a SF event and supported by a SN II the
main driving mechanism of the super-bubble Mac Low  McCray 1988 starts
to vanish after about 40 Myr due to relling with gas through diusion processes
or SF events in the neighboring cells For our simulation we assume a diusion
timescale of 350 Myr for a cell size region following the numerical simulations
by Recchi  Hensler 2005 who found the rell time to be ranging from 125 to
600 Myr
3 APPLICATION OF THE MODEL
The described model is most appropriate for late-type spiral galaxies for the
following reasons Firstly because the models based on the SSPSF scenario pro-
duce patchy star forming region patterns which are similar to late-type occulent
spiral galaxies Seiden  Gerola 1982 Secondly we do not model the formation
and evolution of the bulge therefore the results are most adequate to galaxies
with a negligible bulge contribution
According to those model properties one of the best candidates for model
tests is the Local Group galaxy M 33
It is the nearest late-type spiral having
a moderate inclination see Table 2 for the adopted parameters As shown by
Ferguson et al 2007 the lack of substructures in the outer regions of this galaxy
indicates its evolution in relative isolation The small distance to the galaxy en-
sures plenty of observational data and makes it the ideal target for chemical and
spectrophotometric evolution studies in terms of the proposed model

31 Model calibration
We model M 33 by simulating a disk composed of 99 rings A cell width of
100 pc corresponds to a 10 kpc disk radius and ts well with the optical disk
radius of the galaxy The disk formation timescale was chosen to correspond to
a slow accretion scenario As recent studies have shown such a scenario is in
better agreement with observations Magrini et al 2007 and the up-to-date infall
rate Grossi et al 2008 An accretion timescale acc of 6 Gyr typical to Sc-
type galaxies Arimoto et al 1992 and a disk scale-length of 2 kpc Freeman
1970 were applied The distribution of mass in the reservoir was chosen to t the
baryonic mass radial distribution calculated from the gas and star surface densities
derived by Corbelli 2003 The galaxy rotation data are taken from Corbelli

Salluci 2000 Based on the best estimate from our modeling of M 33 we assume
its age to be 12 Gyr
32 Comparison with observations
Our model predicts gas and star disk surface densities which are in good agree-
ment with observations Figures 2 and 3 A good agreement with the gas surface
density indicates that the adopted parametrization of gas dynamics is adequate
for this study However the predicted relatively sharp cut-o in the stellar density
prole could be an artifact of our model because there is no dispersion of stars
between the cells introduced and stars remain in situ positions Roskar et al
2008 have shown that such an assumption is incorrect however this does not
change the galactic parameters signicantly

Disk galaxy SSPSF models
The radial prole of star formation rate predicted by the model Figure 4 is
also in good agreement with observations
For the comparison of M 33 with the model predictions we use oxygen abun-
dances in H II zones and metallicities of blue supergiants The model oxygen
abundances are derived assuming the scaled solar metallicity by Asplund et al
2005 Recently Rosolowsky  Simon 2008 provided the largest homogeneous
sample of H II zone abundances in M 33 Figure 5 The metallicities of blue su-
pergiants Figure 6 are taken from Urbaneja et al 2005 and U et al 2009
It is evident that both samples display dierent behavior The supergiants show
a steeper metallicity gradient and systematically higher metallicity values The
determination of the radial metallicity gradient in H II zones is uncertain due to a
high intrinsic scatter of the data

Fig 6 The metallicity prole of gas in M 33 The solid line denotes the average
of 30 models the circles with error bars indicate the abundances in blue supergiants from
Urbaneja et al 2005 and U et al 2009
A systematic H II zone under-abundance was discussed by Stasinska 2005
 at the solar metallicity the measured abundance can be underestimated by
02 dex Therefore bearing in mind systematic dierences in abundances between
the H II zones and blue supergiants our model is in reasonable agreement with
both datasets Judging from a few observation data points Urbaneja et al 2005
U et al 2009 at large radii our model produces too sharp cuto in the outer disk
which could be explained by the neglected star exchange between the models cells
Spitoni et al 2008 have shown that during a SF event there is a possibility to
contaminate regions at distances of up to 1 kpc by a super-bubble blow-out which
can considerably smooth the abundance gradients in real disks
4 CONCLUSIONS
We propose a new model of chemical and spectrophotometric evolution of disk
galaxies based on the stochastic self-propagating star formation scenario We
have extended the disk galaxy model by Seiden  Gerola 1982 and supplemented
it with the disk formation through the accretion process the parameterized gas
dynamics inside the disk and the chemical and photometric evolution treatment
based on a simple stellar population approach
The model of the late-type galaxy M 33 is in good agreement with the observed
radial proles of gas and star surface density oxygen abundance metallicity and
star formation rate surface density
