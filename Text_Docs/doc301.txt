ABSTRACT
Many approaches to obtaining cosmological constraints rely on the connection between galaxies and dark
matter However the distribution of galaxies is dependent on their formation and evolution as well as the
cosmological model and galaxy formation is still not a well-constrained process Thus methods that probe
cosmology using galaxies as a tracer for dark matter must be able to accurately estimate the cosmological
parameters without knowing the details of galaxy formation a priori We apply this reasoning to the method
of obtaining m and 8 from galaxy clustering combined with the mass-to-number ratio of galaxy clusters To
test the sensitivity of this method to variations due to galaxy formation we consider several different models
applied to the same cosmological dark matter simulation The cosmological parameters are then estimated
using the observables in each model marginalizing over the parameters of the Halo Occupation Distribution
HOD We nd that for models where the galaxies can be well represented by a parameterized HOD this
method can successfully extract the desired cosmological parameters for a wide range of galaxy formation

1 INTRODUCTION
Galaxies trace the dark matter distribution in the Universe
in a biased and non-trivial way which depends on the proper-
ties of the galaxy sample However the connection between
galaxies and dark matter halos makes determining their bias
feasible Dark matter halos are collapsed virialized struc-
tures which grow from from initial density perturbations in
the early universe Galaxies form at the centers of the poten-
tial wells of these halos Therefore the distribution of galax-
ies is closely related to the dark matter distribution in the uni-
verse The bias of a galaxy population depends on 1 the
cosmology which determines the statistics of the halo pop-
ulation and 2 the processes of galaxy formation going on
within each halo This galaxy bias must be accounted for
when using measures such as galaxy clustering to infer prop-
erties of the dark matter distribution and the underlying cos-
mology
In particular differences in predictions for galaxy
formation from that of actual galaxies may be mistaken for
differences instead in the dark matter and cosmology
Previous studies have focused on using galaxy clustering
alone to determine the cosmology or a parameterized relation-
ship between galaxies and dark matter A common approach
is to use a halo occupation distribution HOD to specify the
relationship between galaxies and dark matter halos and then
to constrain the parameters of this relationship using measure-
ments such as galaxy two-point clustering eg Yang et al
2008 2009 Zehavi et al 2011 Leauthaud et al 2012 and
references therein Other methods of inferring the relation-
ship between galaxies and dark matter include satellite kine-
matics More et al 2009 galaxy group catalogs Yang et al
2009 abundance matching Reddick et al 2013 and refer-
ences therein and counts-in-cells Reid  Spergel 2009
In parallel to these methods and to take advantage of up-
coming galaxy cluster results here we examine the method
described in Tinker et al 2012 This approach combines a
two-point clustering measurement with the mass-to-number
MN cluster statistic MN is the ratio between the mass of
the cluster determined via weak lensing and the number of
galaxies it contains of some well-dened type typically spec-
ied by cuts in luminosity and color The clustering is mea-
sured on all galaxies in the sample while MN isolates only
the galaxies in the most highly biased halos The information
in MN is analogous to that in the mass-to-light ML ratio
of clusters which was combined with halo occupation tech-
niques by van den Bosch et al 2003 and Tinker et al 2005
to break the degeneracy between cosmology and galaxy bias
In this paper we will demonstrate that this approach accu-
rately recovers the cosmological parameters m and 8 for a
variety of different galaxy formation models These models
include signicant differences in the efciency of galaxy for-
mation producing different galaxy populations over the same
sample of halos
In sum we show that including the MN
statistic with galaxy clustering allows us to marginalize over
galaxy formation and galaxy bias to accurately measure cos-
mological parameters
Ongoing surveys such as the Baryon Oscillation Spectro-
scopic Survey BOSS Dawson et al 2013 and the Dark En-
ergy Survey Albrecht et al 2006 provide or will provide
galaxies over a large enough volume and depth to make pre-
cise statements about their properties
In relation to these
large surveys there have been signicant recent improve-
ments in optical galaxy cluster nding eg Rykoff et al
2012 The improvements include accurate cluster photomet-
ric redshifts and richness estimates both of which are impor-
tant to accurately determining the dark matter distribution
We will begin by discussing the different galaxy models we
Reddick et al
use in 2 The MN method will be briey reviewed in 3 In
4 we will present the results of applying this method to our
different models We will summarize our results and discuss
future directions in 5 Unless stated otherwise all values are

2 MODELS
We use a handful of cosmological simulation boxes with
several galaxy formation models applied First we use the
Consuelo box from the LasDamas suite of N-body simula-
tions 1 The underlying cosmology uses m  025 and 8 
08 The ROCKSTAR halonder Behroozi et al 2013a is used
for halo identication along with merger trees drawn from
Behroozi et al 2013b The mass resolution of  2  109
allows us to resolve halos that typically host galaxies below
L To this simulation we apply two different methods of
generating galaxy models The rst method is a semi-analytic
model SAM based on the methods of Lu et al 2011 and
Lu et al 2012 and the second is an abundance matching
method as described in Reddick et al 2013
For the rst of the two semi-analytic models we adopt a
SAM that includes exible parameterizations for the most
important baryonic processes in galaxy formation to follow
the evolution of galaxies in a set of dark matter halo merger
trees The baryonic processes implemented in this SAM are
described in Lu et al 2011 2012 Different from the previ-
ously published versions the version of the model adopted
for this paper is applied on a set of halo merger trees ex-
tracted from the Consuelo simulation which is a cosmologi-
cal N-body simulation with subhalos identied We consider
two different versions of this SAM One version adopts a set
of parameters randomly chosen from the posterior distribu-
tion of the model that was constrained by the K-band lumi-
nosity function of local galaxies Lu et al 2012 There-
fore the model reproduces the K-band luminosity function of
low-redshift galaxies We refer this version as SAM v1 We
note that because the model was constrained on Monte Carlo
merger trees generated based on extended Press-Schechter
EPS theory when the SAM is applied to the simulation
merger trees the model reproduces the constraining data with
a larger discrepancy
The second semi-analytic model is unconstrained by ob-
servational data and called SAM v2 We arbitrarily change
two parameters from SAM v1 Specically we increase the
mass scale for the halo quenching by one order of magnitude
and decrease the supernova feedback mass-loading factor by
a factor of 2 These modications result in an enhanced cool-
ing of hot gas in high-mass halos and a reduced star forma-
tion feedback in low-mass halos The intent is to compare
the results from a model with a physically motivated connec-
tion between galaxies and dark matter halos SAM v1 with a
model deliberately chosen to differ greatly from physical real-
ism SAM v2 Thus the way galaxies form is very different
between the two models producing a dramatically different
galaxyhalo connection The observational measures we use
to infer cosmology are substantially different between the two
models even though the halo population is the same For in-
stance SAM v2 has many more bright galaxies than SAM v1
A comparison of the spatial distribution of the galaxies in the
two SAMs is shown in Fig 1
The second method matches galaxies to halos and subhalos

using the abundance matching techniques of Reddick et al
2013 This method explicitly matches the observed lumi-
nosity function from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and asso-
ciates these luminosities with the mass or a mass proxy of
dark matter halos and subhalos in the simulation The bright-
est galaxy expected in the volume is assigned to the most mas-
sive halo or with the highest mass proxy second brightest to
second most massive and so on For our mass proxy we use
the peak maximum circular velocity that each halo or sub-
halo has had over its history Some degree of scatter in lumi-
nosity at xed mass is also included This will be referred to
as the SHAM subhalo abundance matching model We use
ve different models Four are based on matching to vpeak
the peak maximum circular velocity a halo or subhalo had
over its history stepping evenly in scatter from 0 to 03 dex
in luminosity at xed vpeak The remaining model using the
maximum circular velocity at the present time vmax with 02
dex scatter Each of these models has a different relationship
between galaxies and dark matter which changes the halo oc-
cupation even with an unchanged luminosity function These
models are summarized in Table 1
These models based on the Consuelo dark matter halos in-
clude large variation in the luminosity function This varia-
tion as well as the associated differences in MN and the clus-
tering demonstrates how different the galaxy formation is in
the three cases and permits a test of whether our method can
successfully extract the cosmological parameters from very
different models
We also use the Bolshoi simulation Klypin et al 2011
which has cosmology m  027 and 8  082 This sim-
ulation has the advantage of probing lower mass subhalos
with the drawback of lower volume relative to Consuelo
250 Mpch3 rather than 420 Mpch3 We will compare
a set of models drawn from those presented in Reddick et al
2013 to demonstrate a smoother variation between HODs
than the few extreme cases in Consuelo The cases we con-
sider will be those matched to the peak maximum circular
velocity or vpeak of the subhalos with scatter ranging from
0 to 03 dex in luminosity at xed vpeak and one model us-
ing the maximum circular velocity at the present time vmax
with 02 dex scatter This smoother variation in the galaxy
model allows a more precise test for systematic variation in
the inferred cosmology with galaxy formation
Our nal pair of models use two larger boxes The Esmer-
alda simulation also drawn from the set of LasDamas simu-
lations has the same cosmology as Consuelo m  025 and
8  080 but larger volume 640 Mpch3 The MultiDark
simulation Riebe et al 2011 has larger volume than Bol-
1000 Mpch3 but the same cosmology m  027
and 8  082 We run the same SHAM model on both simu-
lations matching to vpeak with 02 dex of scatter Since both
of these simulations with larger volume have poorer mass res-
olution we will consider galaxy populations at lower number
density brighter luminosities where the missing low-mass
halos will not have a large impact We will use these two
models as a test of the distinction between cosmologies and
to demonstrate changes in the constraints with larger volume
For all the Bolshoi and Consuelo models we use a lumi-
nosity threshold of Mr  205 to determine our galaxy sam-
ple For the Esmeralda and MultiDark simulations we use
a xed number density cuts of 121  103 Mpch3 and
300 104 Mpch3 respectively which correspond to lu-
minosity thresholds of Mr  210 and Mr  21447
Because the halo model we use is an approximation there
will be physical effects both in the real universe and our sim-
ulations that are not incorporated into the HOD Using the
simulations to make mock galaxy catalogs provides a way to
test that the approximations in the HOD do not reduce the ef-
cacy of the HOD approach These possible physics effects
include
 Scatter in the concentration-mass relationship of dark
matter halos Estimates of this scatter in the literature
range from  01  018 Bullock et al 2001 Wu et al
2013b for cluster-sized halos If satellite galaxies fol-
low the same scatter in concentrations as the dark mat-
ter then the distribution of very small-scale pairs may
be different from the no-scatter case
 Non-spherical halos Any non-spherical distribution of
halo substructure and thus of subhalos and galaxies
could potentially alter the two-point correlation Espe-
cially on small scales additional correlations in shape
such as between neighboring halos or within halos can
enhance the two-point clustering relative to the case
with spherical halos This is demonstrated by some
current studies eg van Daalen et al 2012 Wu et al
2013a and references therein
 Deviations of the subhalo distribution from an NFW
prole eg Gao et al 2008 or from the dark matter
concentration-mass relation As discussed in the previ-
ous point systematic deviations of the satellite galaxy
distribution in halos from what is expected will gen-
erally produce systematic differences in the clustering
predicted from a given HOD particularly at the small-
est scales
 Non-poisson scatter in the subhalo or satellite galaxy
distribution The distribution for the number of satel-
lites in halos of a given mass is generally described as
a Poisson distribution with mean cid104NsatMvircid105 While
previous works Zheng et al 2005 Yang et al 2008
have found results consistent with a Poisson distribu-
tion there exists a possibility of deviations from Pois-
son eg Kravtsov et al 2004 particularly when the
mean number of satellites is small In turn a difference
in this distribution of satellites at low host halo mass
or richness has the potential to alter the two-point clus-
tering at small or moderate scales near the transition
between the one-halo and two-halo terms
Reddick et al
 Assembly bias As discussed in eg Gao et al 2005
Croton et al 2007 assembly bias alters the distribu-
tion of galaxies even in the case where the mean num-
ber of galaxies per halo is held constant That is the
number of galaxies per halo depends on both the mass
of the halo and how it was formed such as earlier or
later formation In this case for a given HOD the MN
measurement would remain the same but the two-point
clustering would differ from that which would be pre-
dicted without assembly bias The extra dependence on
formation time or another parameter could potentially
biased constraint
In short there are a number of approximations in our HOD
framework Thus in addition to testing different models of
galaxy formation it is necessary to demonstrate that none of
these approximations has a deleterious effect on our ability
to recover cosmological parameters in an unbiased fashion
In the following section we will show that we recover the
true cosmology in all cases even when tested with Gpc-sized
simulations that yield clustering measurements with errors on
the order of a few percent
3 METHODS
We combine two measurements to reconstruct the cosmol-
ogy The rst is a projected two-point correlation function
eg Zehavi et al 2005 2011 Watson et al 2011 Nuza et al
2012 and references therein We obtain errors by scaling to
the variation in clustering in multiple other simulation boxes
of the same resolution for Consuelo or in a set of PM boxes
of adequate resolution for the scales of interest Bolshoi In
all cases we use the full covariance matrices
The second measurement is the MN value which we ob-
tain by rst assigning a richness to the isolated halos This
is to emulate observations where an optical richness is used as
a mass proxy We assume a mass-richness relationship of the
N200  109  075 lnMvirMpiv
We use a value of Mpiv  144  1013Mcid12h and include a
Gaussian scatter of 035 in lnN or 015 dex in richness at
xed mass This form is that of Rozo et al 2009 changed to
h1 units
To recover the expected MN ratio for each bin in richness
N200 we evaluate an expression similar to that presented in
Tinker et al 2012
cid82 dMnhMPN200MM
cid82 dMnhMPN200Mcid104Nsatcid105M
Here nhM is the halo mass function PN200M is the
distribution of richnesses at xed mass a log-normal as de-
scribed above cid104Nsatcid105M is the mean number of satellites above
the luminosity threshold in a halo of mass M Covariance ma-
trices are estimated via jackknife resampling of the galaxy
simulation
We simultaneously t the HOD and the cosmological pa-
rameters m and 8 using an HOD model combined with the
halo mass function of Tinker et al 2008 and bias functions
of Tinker et al 2010 We t the two-point clustering and the
MN measurements using a six-parameter HOD of the form

We nd that the recovery of the cosmological parameters
is insensitive to small differences in the analytic form of the
HOD so long as the HOD model is capable of capturing the
important features As will be demonstrated in the SAM mod-
els differences in the HOD at the low-mass end may be com-
pensated for However unusual HODs at the massive end
can complicate our procedure This is especially problematic
for HODs where the fraction of halos with a central galaxy
brighter than the chosen threshold is signicantly less than

measurements as a function of cluster richness from the galaxy formation models Panel d Constraints on cosmological parameters after marginalizing over
HOD parameters The true cosmology is indicated with the solid square
one In the models we have considered this occurs for thresh-
olds with roughly Mr  215 We discuss the necessity of
using a more complex form for the HOD in Appendix A
and the cosmology Adding the MN measurement breaks this
degeneracy by placing a strong constraint on the power law
part of the HOD This restricts the possible number of satellite
galaxies and therefore the small-scale clustering in particular
An example t to SAM v1 is shown in Fig 2 The wprp and
MN measurements on the SAM are clearly well-reproduced
There are some degeneracies that remain in the model The
shape of the cutoff of the HOD at low host halo masses for
central galaxies is not always well reproduced as is clear in
Fig 2 In this regime the MN ratio provides no constraint
as halos there are too low mass and have too few galaxies
for MN to be reliably measured Thus there is a signi-
cant degeneracy between the parameters that control the cut-
off which is constrained only by the two-point clustering in
the transition region between the 1-halo and 2-halo terms
Nonetheless we nd that ts to the models are more accu-
rate if all three cutoff parameters Mmin  Mlin are included
In the particular case of SAM v1 there is an extra feature in
the HOD produced by quenching that is not captured by the
form of the HOD we have chosen A good t to the MN and
clustering does exist though the precision of the measured
cosmological parameters is reduced While we do not expect
such an unusual HOD to occur physically it is encouraging
To calculate the clustering from the HOD galaxies are as-
sumed to follow an NFW prole Navarro et al 1997 Guo
et al 2012 Tinker et al 2012 with a concentration of
fcon  cvir where cvir is the host halo concentration The MN
ratio is calculated using the HOD and the N200 relationship
given in Eq 1 The concentrations are based on the model
of Bullock et al 2001 using the updated parameters from
Wechsler et al 2006 A test using the concentration-mass
relation of Prada et al 2012 did not show any signicant
difference in the estimation of parameters aside from fcon
Therefore we do not expect that the precise details of the
concentration-mass relation will signicantly affect our re-
Because the value of Mmin is set by the number density of
galaxies we are left with ve free HOD parameters and two
free cosmological parameters m and 8 We then use a
Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to explore this parameter
space with at priors
As described in Tinker et al 2012 tting to the clustering
alone results in degeneracies between the HOD parameters

4 RESULTS
The results using the Consuelo models are shown in Fig 3
Fig 3a shows the very different luminosity functions of each
model as well as the different clustering and MN results for
the Mr  205 sample However all three galaxy models are
built on the same halo population Thus the differences in
clustering and MN are due only to differences in the halo oc-
cupation The models are well-separated in halo occupation
as is shown by the MN ratio The constraints in the m  8
in Fig 3d show the result of applying our method marginaliz-
ing over the HOD In all three cases the results are consistent
with the true cosmology The larger area of the SAM v1 con-
tours is largely due to the difculty in accurately reproducing
the non-monotonic HOD that is present in that model
The Bolshoi models are shown in Fig 4 in the same format
as given in Fig 3 We omit the model with scatter of 01 dex
from this plot for the sake of clarity due to its similarity to
the zero-scatter case Because the luminosity function is the
same for all of the SHAM galaxy models used on the Bolshoi
simulation we instead show the HODs in Fig 4a In all cases
the contours in Fig 4 are consistent with the input cosmology
For the large-volume models using the Esmeralda and
MultiDark simulations prior to running the MCMC chain
we constrain the scale-dependent halo bias For the other
models we use the parameterization and exact parameters
presented in Tinker et al 2005 That parameterization is
given by

1  117mr149
1  069mr209
where mr is the non-linear matter clustering For all the
smaller volume simulations
the numerical factors in this
equation are held xed which is sufcient for the true HOD
measured from the simulation to accurately reproduce the
two-point clustering However this is not the case for Es-
meralda and MultiDark Therefore we separately t these
numerical factors in those cases while holding the HOD and
cosmology xed to the truth values This is necessary to en-
sure that the modeling of the wprp from the true HOD is
accurate The previous study in Tinker et al 2012 stated
that br was one of the main systematic uncertainties in the
analysis Our investigation demonstrates that br is not mass-
independent In a future work we will present a new calibra-

models Panel d Constraints on cosmological parameters after marginalizing over HOD parameters The true cosmology for the Esmeralda-based model is
shown with a green diamond the MultiDark cosmology is shown with a black triangle
For this family of models we also nd that the contours are
very similar to each other regardless of the quantity of scat-
ter This is not surprising as the HOD for these models is
very similar for massive halos with differences only becom-
ing clear below the halo mass where MN is measured The
signicantly reduced number of galaxies in the vmax model
increases the variance in the MN measurement somewhat
increasing the area of the contour and altering its shape

against the input Diamonds indicate the median result and error bars give
the 68 bounds Dashed lines indicate the true value from the relevant sim-
ulations
sults and the marginalized errors for all of the models While
in some cases the truth is outside the marginalized 68 con-
dence limits the results are consistent in the m  8 plane
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The models using signicantly larger volumes in the Es-
meralda and MultiDark simulations are shown in Fig 5 We
also note here that rather than using the MN ratio with N
as the number of satellites the analysis on Esmeralda uses
the ratio between the mass and the total number of galaxies
MNtot This helps avoid some of the complications with de-
viations of the central HOD from our tting function which
occurs at relatively high masses for sufciently bright lumi-
nosity thresholds Ultimately we expect that using all of a
clusters galaxies when working with observations will help
avoid additional systematic errors introduced by miscentering
eg Rozo  Rykoff 2013 Regardless analyses on both
simulations provide relatively tight and accurate cosmologi-
cal measurements either within the 1- contours MultiDark
or just on the edge of 1- Esmeralda Note the smaller axes
in Fig 5d relative to panel d in the previous gures
To summarize all of our models Fig 6 shows the best t re-
Reddick et al
We investigate the combination of galaxy clustering and the
mass-to-number ratio of galaxies in clusters as a cosmological
probe rst introduced by Tinker et al 2012 Here we focus
on the ability of this method to obtain robust cosmological
constraints while marginalizing over galaxy formation We
consider four cosmological boxes with different galaxy for-
mation prescriptions number densities clustering properties
luminosity functions underlying halo occupations and box
volumes For all ten models we examine we are able to re-
cover the correct m and 8 values within the 68 contour
This suggests that for data samples of this size we are effec-
tively able to marginalize over the physics of galaxy formation
and its consequent galaxyhalo connection to obtain unbiased
cosmological parameters We suggest that this kind of anal-
ysis should become standard procedure for all cosmological
constraints that depend on galaxy properties or the galaxy
halo connection
Of some interest is the dependence of our results on the
analytic form of the HOD we choose Our current model is
clearly adequate for the galaxy models we present here How-
ever a more extreme HOD than that of SAM v1 with a much
larger decrement in the HOD was only poorly t and gave
biased cosmological parameters We expect that a such non-
monotonic HOD is not physical However for non-standard
galaxy samples for example those selected by color or star
formation rate rather than by luminosity care should be taken
to assure that the analytic form of the HOD is exible enough
to model the data
In future work we expect to obtain tighter constraints by
using multiple different luminosity thresholds on the same
data set or by using multiple redshifts We anticipate apply-
ing this method to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
the BOSS survey and the Dark Energy Survey We may ap-
ply this method to cluster galaxies only rather than all galax-
ies which may eliminate some of the uncertainties associ-
ated with the low host halo mass cutoff in the HOD Angular
clustering combined with accurate photometric redshifts will
allow application of this method to the large volumes being
probed by photometric surveys Further work will be required
to show to robustness of this method to photometric redshift
errors and over wide redshift ranges

Cosmological Constraints with Arbitrary Halo Occupation
Figure 7 Comparison of different HOD models Top Black points show the two-point correlation measured on MultiDark Lines are the correlation functions
calculated from different HODs The subplot shows the difference between the values measured in the simulation and the clustering predicted from the HOD
models Bottom Black diamonds are the measured central HOD and black squares the measured satellite HOD Lines are the HOD models corresponding to
the clustering shown in the upper plot Solid lines are the central HOD and dashed lines the satellite part The HOD models are t to the HOD measured in
the simulation rather than to the wprp and MN and used to predict the wprp The HOD line uses only a ve-parameter model with two parameters for the
central part while the HOD version uses two additional parameters to describe the shape of the central part of the HOD The wp models are t to the wprp
and the MN with cosmology xed Again the plus denotes a t using additional parameters The models with additional parameters clearly provide a better t
to the wprp in both cases
A PARAMETERIZATION OF THE HOD
We use a slightly more complex variation on the HOD relative to other works based on the halo occupation distribution eg
Zehavi et al 2011 because we nd that incorrect modeling of the central part of the HOD can cause large deviations in the
two-point clustering particularly for bright thresholds
An example of this is shown in Fig 7 Here we present a comparison of the true HOD and clustering from the simulation
In all these cases we hold the cosmology xed
points compared against several different instances of the HOD model
Restating our HOD model we have

This model reduces to the more standard ve-parameter model if fcen is set to zero which also ensures that Mlin no longer has
any effect We demonstrate the difference between these two HOD models as applied to our MultiDark sample in Fig 7
Our rst comparison is between the HOD and HOD models keeping our cosmology xed to the true values The HOD
Reddick et al
models are produced by tting to the HOD directly and then using that specic model to predict the clustering While the seven-
parameter model produces a good t HOD the other does not This is because the only way to reproduce the lack of centrals at
high halo mass in the ve-parameter model is to increase the Mmin threshold and greatly increase the width log M The clustering
produced in this case is severely suppressed due to the inclusion of many low-mass halos which also forces the number density
to be far too high
We also test tting each model to the wprp and MN statistics allowing only the HOD parameters to vary For our best rst
we obtain a 2 of 19 for our seven-parameter model 13 degrees of freedom This is a marginally good t P2  19  01
The model with ve parameters has a 2 of 119 15 degrees of freedom which is clearly not acceptable Visually the latter

model is clearly insufciently clustered on moderate to large scales rp
this case would bias m low and 8 high relative to the true values
