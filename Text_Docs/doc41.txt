A promising direction in drug development is to exploit the ability of natural killer cells to kill
antibody-labeled target cells Monoclonal antibodies and drugs designed to elicit this eect typically
bind cell-surface epitopes that are overexpressed on target cells but also present on other cells Thus
it is important to understand adhesion of cells by antibodies and similar molecules We present an
equilibrium model of such adhesion incorporating heterogeneity in target cell epitope density and
epitope immobility We compare with experiments on the adhesion of Jurkat T cells to bilayers
containing the relevant natural killer cell receptor with adhesion mediated by the drug alefacept
We show that a model in which all target cell epitopes are mobile and available is inconsistent with
the data suggesting that more complex mechanisms are at work We hypothesize that the immobile
epitope fraction may change with cell adhesion and we nd that such a model is more consistent
with the data We also quantitatively describe the parameter space in which binding occurs Our
results point toward mechanisms relating epitope immobility to cell adhesion and oer insight into
the activity of an important class of drugs

INTRODUCTION
When a pathogen elicits a humoral immune response
antibodies are produced that bind to specic epitopes
on the surface of the pathogen Once antibodies have
bound to the pathogen it is labeled as foreign and vari-
ous processes can follow that lead to its elimination One
such process antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotox-
icity ADCC involves natural killer NK cells binding
through their FcRIIIa CD16a receptors to IgG anti-
bodies decorating the pathogen reviewed in 1 The
coupling of an NK cell to a target cell brings parts of the
surfaces of the two cells into proximity within roughly
100 A In the region of tight contact where antibodies
form bridges between the two cells both the density of
epitopes on the target cell and the density of Fc receptors
on the NK cell are locally increased When the density
of Fc receptors in the contact region on the NK cell is
suciently high a cellular response is triggered the end
point of which is the release of lytic granules containing
perforin and granzymes whose combined eect results
in the killing of the target cell 24 Depending on the
nature of the epitope and type of cell the aggregation
of epitopes on the target cell may also trigger cellular
responses 5 6

teins have been developed to take advantage of ADCC
These drugs target naturally occurring proteins that are
overexpressed on tumor cells and on populations of cells
that drive autoimmune responses 1 710 Unfortu-
nately the drug will also target a subset of healthy cells
because the target is a naturally occurring protein An
obvious question which we address in this paper is what
properties of the drug the cells that express the target
protein and the NK cells determine the drugs ability
to discriminate between pathogenic and healthy cells A
second question that we consider that is closely related
to the rst is what determines the range of drug concen-
trations over which the drug will couple target cells to
NK cells These drugs either in animal models or pa-
tients must compete for Fc receptors on NK cells with
endogenous IgG 11 We therefore also look at how back-
ground IgG inuences the range of drug concentrations
over which adhesion occurs
We previously presented an equilibrium model that de-
scribes the coupling via a monoclonal antibody or an
appropriate fusion protein of identical target cells to a
surface expressing mobile Fc receptors 12 Here we
signicantly extend our model to allow for a target cell
population with a heterogeneous surface epitope density
This allows us to analyze experiments where the percent-
age of target cells bound is determined as a function of
the ligand concentration We also extend the model to
address the possibility that some fraction of the target
epitopes are immobile including cases in which the im-
mobile fraction depends on epitope cross-linking or the
size of the contact region These cases model some po-
tential target cell responses to adhesion
To test predictions of the model we use an experi-
mental system consisting of a planar bilayer containing
mobile FcRIIIb CD16b receptors Jurkat T cells ex-
pressing the cell-adhesion molecule CD2 and a drug
alefacept that binds the target cell to the bilayer 12
FcRIIIb diers from FcRIIIa the receptor on NK
cells in that it lacks a transmembrane region and a cyto-
plasmic tail and anchors to membranes via glycosolphos-
phatidylinositol 13 Further the extracellular domains
of the two receptors dier by six amino acids which
probably accounts for FcRIIIb having a lower anity
for IgG than FcRIIIa 13 14 Alefacept is a recombi-
nant fusion protein that has an antibody-like architec-
ture where the Fab binding sites have been replaced by
the natural ligand for CD2 the extracellular domain of
CD58 15 16 fused to the human IgG1 hinge CH 2 and
CH 3 domains 2 It is used in the treatment of psoriasis
an autoimmune disease where it targets memory-eector
T cells that have increased levels of CD2 on their surface
Alefacept reduces the number of circulating memory-
eector T cells in treated patients and mediates ADCC
in vitro 2 1720
Alefacept is an example of an immunoadhesin which
is molecule that uses the basic framework of an IgG
antibody but replaces the Fab binding sites with the
ecotodomain of an adhesion molecule Immunoadhesins
have the specicity of an adhesion molecule as well as
some properties of an antibody such as the ability to
bind to Fc receptors and a half-life in plasma that is sim-
ilar to IgG 21 22 An interesting property of alefacept
is that it mediates adhesion and killing of target cells by
NK cells at nM concentrations 12 even though both the
binding of IgG to FcRIIIa and the binding of CD58 to
CD2 23 are low anity in the M range The model we
present will show how the range of drug concentrations
over which adhesion occurs depends on these equilibrium
constants as well as the other parameters of the system
II MODEL AND METHODS
We consider a population of target cells expressing a
particular epitope with some fraction of the epitopes
freely diusing in the target cell membrane and the re-
mainder immobile
ie xed in position on the mem-
brane Additionally we consider a bilayer with mobile
receptors diusing on its surface and a ligand capable of
simultaneously binding both the epitope and the recep-
tor through dierent sites The ligand is either a mono-
clonal antibody or an immunoadhesin its Fab arms bind
monovalently or divalently to the epitope on the target
cells and its Fc leg binds monovalently to the receptor
on the bilayer At some ligand concentration a contact
region forms between the cell and the bilayer its area is
an increasing function of the number of ligand-mediated
bridging bonds that form

A Concentrations and equilibrium constants
The potential reactions between epitopes ligand and
receptor are illustrated in Fig 1 Each molecular com-
plex is labeled by our mathematical notation for its sur-
face concentration All species except those involving a
bridging bond b10 b20 b11 and b01 exist both inside
and outside the contact region and the subscript in
denotes species inside the contact region Detailed bal-
ance places six constraints on the equilibrium constants
which we use to eliminate the underlined constants in
Fig 1 see Supporting Material for more detail To nd
the equilibrium state of this system for any given bulk
ligand concentration L we solve ve algebraic equations
for ve unknowns the free immobile epitope concentra-
tion outside i and inside iin the contact region the free
mobile epitope e and receptor r concentrations outside
the contact region and the fraction of the target cell
surface  comprising the contact region To make anal-
ysis tractable we make several simplifying assumptions
regarding the equilibrium conguration of receptors and
epitopes
Our rst assumption is that the equilibrium constants
for reactions involving immobile epitopes are identical to
the corresponding constants involving mobile epitopes

expect that this assumption leads to negligible error be-
cause the relevant physical interactions are identical for
mobile and immobile epitopes
Our second assumption is that the typical distance be-
tween immobile epitopes on the target cell is large com-
pared with the span of the two arms of the ligand so that
the ligand cannot cross-link immobile epitopes Thus we
do not consider complexes containing more than one im-
mobile receptor Given a CD2 surface density  and as-
suming the CD2 epitopes are uniformly distributed the
probability P d  a that an epitopes nearest neighbor
is a distance a away or closer is 24

As detailed later each T-cell contains of order 64000
CD2 epitopes over a surface area of roughly 800 m2
yielding a density of   80 m2 Given this den-
sity the probability that an epitopes nearest neighbor
is closer than the span of roughly 10 nm 25 between
epitope binding arms of an antibody-like molecule such
as alefacept is less than 3 We expect that cross-links
between immobile epitopes will indeed be rare because
the density of immobile epitopes is even lower than the
total epitope surface density
Our third assumption relates the free mobile epitope
and receptor concentrations inside and outside the con-
tact region In earlier experiments uorescently labeled
CD48 Cy5-CD48 was coupled to the bilayer and it was
observed that the uorescence from CD48 was reduced
in the contact region to approximately 75 of its value
outside the contact region 12 This suggests that the
contact region introduces steric hindrance and partitions
mobile surface proteins between the inside and outside
of the contact region We assume that at equilibrium
ein  Ee and rin  Rr where ein and rin are the
free epitope and free receptor concentrations inside the
contact region and E and R are equilibrium partition
coecients The partition coecients for FcRIIIb and
CD2 have not been determined we assume they behave
similarly to CD48 because they are of similar size so we
take R  E  075
Using the law of mass action and these additional as-
sumptions we can write down the equilibrium concentra-
tion of all bound complexes in terms of the free epitope
receptor and ligand concentrations For example the
concentration hin of complexes inside the contact region
consisting of a ligand cross-linking a mobile and an im-
mobile epitope is
hin  Kxiine1in  2KxKELiinein  2KxKELEiine
The factor of 2 in calculating the concentration e1in of
complexes between a ligand and mobile epitope arises be-
cause KE is a single-site equilibrium constant and there
are two potential binding sites on the ligand Similarly
the concentration b11 of bridging complexes involving a

porting Material

tition coecients E and R the total receptor rT  epi-
tope eT  and ligand concentrations LT  the epitope im-
mobile fraction  and a parameter  that relates the area
of the contact region to the number of bridging bonds In
addition to connect our model with the data we require
the surface area Acell of the Jurkat T cells studied and
an oset area Ao that accounts for non-specic adhesion
between the cells and the bilayer detailed later In our
analyses a number of these parameters were held xed

Most of our xed parameter values come directly from
measurements an exception is Kx the cross-linking con-
stant for alefacept binding To estimate Kx we equate
the measured apparent dissociation constant KD for ale-
facept adhering to T cells to the inverse of the initial slope

monovalent receptor 26

exception of the t parameter Kb2 our results are insen-
sitive to the precise value of Kx Fig S1 in Supporting
Material The parameter Ao is inferred from our data
as discussed below
B Conservation laws
In the experiments we consider there is negligible de-
pletion of ligand so the free ligand concentration is well
approximated by the total ligand concentration L 
LT  Conservation of epitopes and receptors however
introduces additional constraints on the concentration of
various complexes
In our model there are three classes of epitopes mo-
bile epitopes immobile epitopes outside the contact re-
gion and immobile epitopes inside the contact region
We assume that the concentrations of all species have
reached equilibrium For mobile epitopes we have
Acell1  eT  Acell  Ae  e1  2e2  h
 Ab10  2b20  b11  ein  e1in  2e2in  hin
where eT is the average epitope density on the cell sur-
face equal to the total epitope count ET divided by the
cell area Acell and A is the area of the contact region
This equation expresses the fact that the total number
of mobile epitopes left-hand side must be equal to the
total number in complexes outside and inside the contact
region In terms of the fraction  of the cell surface in
the contact region the above conservation law is

Similarly for immobile epitopes outside the contact re-
gion we have
 eT  i  i1  h
and for immobile epitopes inside the contact region we

For receptors in the bilayer we have
Abl rT  Arin  r1in  b10  b20  b01  b11
 Abl  Ar  r1
where Abl is the total area of the bilayer divided by the
number of adhered cells Dividing by Acell and rearrang-
ing yields

where   AcellAbl In the experiments we analyze for
all ligand concentrations the adhered cells are sparsely
distributed over the bilayer so we take   0
C Contact region growth law
Bell Dembo and Bongrand argued 30 that the bridg-
ing bond density between two adhered cells is determined
by a constant repulsive pressure arising from electrostatic
repulsion caused by negative charges associated with cell
surfaces and steric stabilization eects The steric ef-
fects arise because cell membranes are coated by a hy-
drated layer of long-chain polymers glycocalyces that
must compress as cells are brought together and water
is squeezed out of the contact region Together with the
assumption that cells are easily deformed this argument
implies that the area of the contact region grows linearly
with the number of bridging bonds
Although we expect the repulsion between our tar-
get cells and bilayer to be smaller than that between
two cells we expect the repulsive forces to be of similar
origin Moreover in our experiments the small contact
regions observed cause only small cellular deformations
and our target Jurkat T cells are signicantly more easily
deformed than some other cell types such as neutrophils
and HL60 cells 31 However in our equilibrium data
the observed average area of the contact region cid104Aobscid105
does not go to zero as the number of bridging bonds goes
to zero Fig 3A an eect seen previously in the bind-
ing of Jurkat T cells to bilayers containing the natural
CD2 ligand CD58 32 We hypothesize that some addi-
tional non-specic adhesion occurs after cells settle onto
the membrane We account for this eect by subtracting
an oset area Ao from our data so that in our modeling
we compare with the average specic adhered area cid104Acid105
which is cid104Aobscid105 Ao  Our procedure for estimating Ao
is discussed in the Results section Once we have sub-
tracted the oset we observe a linear relationship be-
tween average contact area and average bridging bond
number suggesting that the bond density  is indeed a
constant In addition to the constraints from conserva-
tion of epitopes and receptors we thus have an additional
constraint on bond density

Solving the ve constraint equations Eq 6 7 8 10
and 11 for the ve unknowns e i iin r and  allows us
to calculate the area of the contact region for a cell with
a specied epitope density eT given the ligand concentra-
tion L We solve the constraint equations and perform all
numerics using the Python library SciPy 33 Uncertain-
ties on t parameters are calculated via bootstrapping
with over 250 bootstrap data sets for each model
D Heterogeneous density of epitopes on target
We now consider a target cell population with a nor-
malized distribution f eT  of epitope densities For a
given ligand concentration if eT min is the minimum epi-
tope density at which adhesion will occur the fraction of
cells bound to the bilayer is

and the average area of the specic contact region is

f eT  deT
Similarly for a xed ligand concentration adhesion oc-
curs only above a minimal epitope density eT min As L or
eT approach these bounds the contact area approaches
some minimal value Amin below which there is no adhe-
sion We make the approximation that Amin  0 Plug-
ging   0 into Eq 6 10 and 11 and substituting our
expressions for equilibrium species concentrations such
as Eq 2 yields a system of three equations for the un-
knowns e r and L For a xed epitope density eT  this
system can be reduced to a single cubic equation in L
which is given in Supporting Material This cubic equa-
tion may have either two positive roots L and L or
no positive roots no adhesion irrespective of L Sim-
ilarly for a xed ligand concentration L the system of
three equations can be reduced to a quadratic equation
for eT  the larger root of which is eT min see Supporting
Material
We expect that taking   0 rather than setting it
equal to some minimal value introduces negligible error in
our estimates of L L and eT min In our experiments
adhesion was determined in the absence of ow based
on whether there was accumulation of the receptor CD58
in the contact area Even in the presence of weak ows
estimates suggest that few bonds and thus small contact
areas are needed to maintain adhesion 35 36
2 Average contact area
When the cells adhered to the bilayer negligibly deplete
the receptors so that   0 and all epitopes are mobile
so that   0 then

To prove this we rst note the constraint imposed by our
relation for the bond density Eq 11 when   0 and
  0
In this case after substituting our equilibrium
relations  is equal to a function of e and r which does
not involve eT  When   0 r is simply rT 1  KRL
from Eq 10 again not involving eT  Thus our relation
for the bond density provides a constraint on the free
epitope density e that is independent of the total epitope
density eT 
In other words all adhered cells will have
the same density of free epitopes and thus of all other
complexes irrespective of their total epitope density eT

and for k  37 it is skewed to the left For k  1 and
  0 the Weibull distribution reduces to the exponential
distribution
Shown in Fig 2 is the distribution of expression of CD2
on the surfaces of a population of Jurkat T cells the tar-
get cells in our study as determined by ow cytometry
This distribution serves as a baseline to judge the distri-
butions arising from our model ts These measurements
were performed on a Becton Dickinson FacsCaliber Flu-
orescein isothiocyanate FITC labeling of antibodies and
the determination of the uoresceineprotein ratio was
determined using absorption spectroscopy 34 Calibra-
tion was performed using FITC standard beads obtained
from Bangs Laboratories Fishers IN Antibody-stained
cells were washed twice prior to analysis
E Analysis of the model with fully mobile epitopes
When all epitopes are mobile   0 and there is no
depletion of bilayer receptors   0 the model simpli-
es substantially to a system of three equations for e r
and  This reduced system oers several useful analytic
results
1 Requirements for adhesion

range of soluble ligand concentrations L  L  L

side e e1 e2 b10 b20 ein e1in and e2in are functions of

of eT  Thus taking the average over adhered cells we

where the right-hand-side is simply the specic contact
area calculated using the average epitope density of ad-
hered cells cid104eTcid105 Thus for the case in which   0 and
all receptors are mobile calculating cid104cid105 does not require
explicitly integrating eT  over our epitope density dis-
tribution f eT  Instead we need only calculate eT min
then cid104eTcid105 and nally cid104cid105
F Calculations with immobile fraction
Analysis of the model with non-zero immobile epitope
fraction   0 is considerably more dicult than the
case of completely mobile epitopes even with   0 To
calculate  we must now numerically solve a system of
ve rather than three algebraic equations Addition-
ally the simplications of the previous section no longer
apply so we must nd the bounding ligand and epitope
concentrations for adhesion using numerical root-nding
and we must calculate cid104cid105 by explicit numerical integra-
tion of eT  over the distribution f eT 
When   0 direct solution of our system of ve
constraint equations will give non-physical results for
those cases in which the immobile epitopes themselves
are dense enough to drive adhesion Because the im-
mobile epitope density is assumed constant over the cell
surface this case results in a divergent contact area  as
demonstrated in Fig S2 In our application this phe-
nomenon only occurs at very high total epitope densities
eT  so it makes only a small contribution in our typical in-
tegrations over f eT  but we must handle it carefully to
avoid numerical diculties The value of  which leads to
this divergence div can be found by solving our conser-
vation equation for immobile epitopes inside the contact
region Eq 8 with b01   yielding

When   div we set   05 consistent with a cell
completely attened against the surface Similarly we
set   05 whenever direct solution of the equations
would yield a larger value for  Altering this maximum
value of  has very small inuence on our results data
not shown as in our experiments the vast majority of
cells have only a small fraction of their area adhered
In our analyses we consider ts with a constant im-
mobile fraction and ts in which the immobile fraction
 is a function of either  or the fraction  of target cell
epitopes that are cross-linked by ligand

tope fraction in the absence of ligand 12 Eq 21 or 22
represents an additional constraint to our previous ve
to account for the additional free variable  There may
be multiple self-consistent solutions of our expanded sys-
tem of six constraint equations see Fig S2 Physically
we expect the cell to adopt the solution corresponding
to smaller  as the cell begins in a state with minimal
epitope immobility In our calculations we always adopt
the smallest possible solution
III RESULTS
Experiments were previously carried out to character-
ize alefacept-mediated bridging of CD2 epitopes on Ju-
rkat T-cells to uorescently-labeled FcRIIIb receptors
on supported bilayers 12 The alefacept concentration L
was varied from 1 nM to 100 M and the fraction of cells
bound to the bilayer the average size of the contact area
and the average number of bonds in the contact area were
determined These types of measurements were made at
two dierent FcRIIIb densities rT on the bilayer 1200
m2 and 625 m2 Here we t several models of in-
creasing complexity to this data Using these models we
then consider the requirements for alefacept-mediated T-
cell adhesion deriving compact expressions for the lim-
iting alefacept concentrations Finally we consider the
eect of background nonspecic IgG on adhesion
In Fig 3A the bridging bond data is plotted against
the area of the contact region From this data we extract
a best-t value for the non-specic contact area of Ao 
617 m2 with a 95 condence interval of 2885 m2
In all our subsequent ts this value is subtracted from
the contact area data so we only t the specic contact
A Fit of fully mobile model
We rst considered an adhesion model with free diu-
sion of all FcRIIIb receptors on the bilayer and all CD2
epitopes on the T cell Simultaneous nonlinear least-
squares ts of this model to the data are shown by the
solid lines in Fig 3B We weighted the experiments so

average number of epitopes per cell was roughly 5500
which is much smaller than the average value of 64000
determined from ow cytometry Fig 2 A reasonable
t could not be obtained when the distribution of epi-
topes per cell was taken directly from the ow cytometry
data data not shown
One counter-intuitive property of the ts is that at high
and low ligand concentrations it appears as if there is a
slow decline in the average contact area and number of
bridging bonds long after the number of bound cells has
gone to zero
In these cases the average contact area
is being calculated over the miniscule fraction of cells
that are adhered For example with rT  1200m2 at
L  104 M an average of 125 bonds per adhered cell is
predicted but this involves only a fraction 1027 of the
total cells In the experiments only a few hundred cells
were sampled per data point so the tails of the Weibull
distribution are a poor description of the cell population
Whether the Weibull distribution is a reasonable descrip-
tion of the epitope density on a target cell population in
vivo is an open question We have also considered a log-
normal distribution Although it can t the ow cytome-
try data in Fig 2 well when it is used to analyze the data
in Fig 3 it predicts that as the ligand concentration de-
creases the average contact area and number of bridging
bonds go through minima and then rise yielding a very
poor t to this data results not shown Thus for the
lognormal distribution and possibly other distributions
the average number of bonds in the contact region can
increase as the ligand concentration goes to zero
This model with freely diusing CD2 epitopes dramat-
ically underestimates the amount of CD2 present on the
T cells Therefore we consider more complex models in-
corporating immobile CD2 epitopes in the following sec-

In prior experiments on Jurkat T cells it was observed
that 13 of CD2 epitopes were immobile in the absence
of ligand 12
It has further been observed in T cells
that cell stimulation may increase CD2 immobility 37
Thus we extended our mathematical model to include
B Fit of models with epitope immobility
BApotential CD2 epitope immobility and t several such
models to the data
We rst considered a model in which the immobile epi-
tope fraction  was a t constant In this case the best-t
value of  was found to be zero yielding an identical t
to the fully mobile case This motivated us to consider
models in which the immobile fraction was a function of
the fraction  of epitopes cross-linked by ligand or the
fractional area  of the specic contact region
When we t a model in which the immobile fraction
was a linear function of  restricting our search to slopes
 0 the best-t value for the slope of that function was
0 yielding a constant immobile fraction of 013 The
resulting model t was slightly worse than the completely
mobile model
The dashed curves in Fig 3B show the results from
a t with the immobile fraction a linear function of the
specic contact area  In this case the t is somewhat
improved and the best-t estimate of total epitope count
per cell is driven upward to roughly 19 000 This esti-
mate of ET is still only a about a third of the value
inferred from the ow cytometry data but it is much
closer than the other models The best-t function for
 is   013  43 so the immobile fraction increases
very rapidly with cell adhesion Note that in our data
the largest average specic contact area seen is roughly
12 m2Acell  0015 so that only small values of  are
typically explored and adding higher-order terms to 
yields negligible improvement in the t data not shown
C Requirements for adhesion
For drug design an important consideration is what
combinations of ligand concentration and target cell epi-
tope count will yield binding The curves in Fig 4A sepa-
rate the region where more than 50 of cells are adhered
inside each curve from the region where less than 50
are adhered for three dierent scenarios The outermost
thick solid curve is the predicted separation curve for the
parameters obtained from the t with all receptors mo-
bile that shown by the solid lines in Fig 3B From this
curve we can see that the minimal ligand concentration
for adhesion L is inversely proportional to the square of
the epitope density ie the bottom portion of the curve
has a slope of approximately negative two
From the complete set of equations for the model with
  0 and   0 we can obtain simple approximations
for L and L for a xed target cell epitope density eT 
L 
T KEKb2KxrT 2
L  eT Kb1rT ER
To approximate L we assume that at the lowest ligand
concentrations that mediate adhesion all bridging bonds
arise from epitopes bound bivalently so Kb1  0 For
the L approximation we assume that at the highest
ligand concentrations that mediate adhesion all ligands
bound to epitopes are bound singly so Kx  Kb2  0
As seen in Fig 4A Eq 23 and 24 closely predict the
ligand concentration of 50 adhesion when we replace
eT by the average epitope density Our approximate ex-
pression for L suggests that ligands similar to alefacept
can achieve considerable selectivity in epitope density
on adhered cells because L falls with the square of
the epitope density Further since the ligand-epitope
cross-linking constant Kx is proportional to the ligand-
epitope binding constant KE Eq 23 implies that L
falls inversely with the square of KE suggesting that a
good strategy for lowering L is to develop ligands with
higher KE values
The dashed curve in Fig 4A bounds the region of ad-
hesion for the best-t model in which the immobile frac-
tion  is a linear function of the contact area  Again
the minimal ligand concentration for adhesion falls as the
square of the epitope density Our expressions for L and
L Eq 23 and 24 are no longer good approximations in
this case but the dependence of L on the ligand-epitope
binding constants KE and Kx is the same This is illus-
trated by the dotted curve which bounds the region of
adhesion for the same model and parameters with the
exception that KE and Kx have been divided by 10 As
expected from Eq 23 the minimal ligand concentration
for adhesion has increased by a factor of 100
D Adhesion inhibition by non-specic IgG
In vivo alefacept-mediated adhesion depends not only
on the concentration of alefacept and the density of CD2
on the T cells but also on the presence of background
nonspecic IgG which can bind the NK cell receptor and
inhibit adhesion To test the sensitivity of adhesion to
background concentrations of nonspecic IgG the per-
centage of cells bound to the bilayer was determined in
the presence of 500 nM of the ligand alefacept and dif-
fering concentrations G of puried human IgG with a re-
ceptor concentration in the bilayer of 450 m2 12 For
inhibition to be signicant we expect that KGG must
be greater than 1 where in these experiments the IgG
binding constant KG is equal to our KR In Fig 4B an
inhibition of 50 is achieved with an IgG concentration
of about 7 M suggesting that KR  15 105 M1 In
our ts we took KR  10  106 M1 2729 Fig 4B
shows good agreement between our predicted inhibition
curve using the best-t parameters for the  model
and the experimental data providing further validation
of our model
a quadratic function of the epitope-ligand binding con-
stants even for our more complex models suggesting
that tuning this interaction may be a fruitful route for
drug design
It is instructive to compare our t parameters with
with those from previous investigations of Jurkat T cell
adhesion A previous analysis of adhesion to bilayers con-
taining the natural CD2 binding partner CD58 found
a non-specic contact area of 76 m2 similar to the
617 m2 we nd 32 That analysis found the density
of bridging bonds  at equilibrium to be approximately
1000 m2 substantially greater than our value of 400
m2 This is unsurprising because the direct CD2-
CD58 interaction draws the cell closer to the bilayer
leading to a larger repulsive force which requires more
bonds to overcome Our value for the 2D association
constant Kb1 between the alefacept-epitope complex and
CD16b are of order 1 m2 This value is similar to previ-
ous results for the 2D association constant between CD2
and CD58 which range from 01 to 09 m2 16 37 38
Thus our t parameters are consistent with those from
the literature
Our data are best described by a model in which the
level of immobilized CD2 on the T cell is proportional to
the contact area rather than the degree of CD2 cross-
linking This suggests that signaling from isolated cross-
linked CD2 pairs may be less eective than signaling from
larger aggregates or from regions of high CD2 density
such as the contact region A similar eect is seen in
signaling from the immune receptor FcRI on rat ba-
sophilic leukemia cells in which receptor dimers signal
weakly compared to larger aggregates 39 Furthermore
recent experiments have observed signaling in Jurkat T
cells adhering to bilayers presenting CD58 the natural
binding partner of CD2 40
In our system comparing the bridging bond density 
of approximately 400 m2 with the initial cellular CD2
density of roughly 80 m2 we see that the density in-
crease in the contact region is roughly a factor of 5 This
increases the fraction of CD2 nearest neighbors within a
given distance by the same factor of 5 Eq 1 substan-
tially increasing the probability of interaction Thus the
increased density of CD2 in the contact region may have
a large eect in promoting interactions between CD2
molecules and driving signaling When alefacept adheres
T cells to NK cells in vivo FcRIIIa receptors on the NK
cell will be similarly concentrated in the contact region
and this concentration may contribute to the signal that
drives NK-mediated killing of target cells Moreover we
expect the repulsive force to be greater between cells than
between a cell and a bilayer so the in vivo bridging bond
density is probably larger leading to greater in vivo re-
ceptor concentration than seen in our experiments
In summary we have developed an equilibrium model
for the immunoadhesin-mediated adhesion of cells to sur-
faces Our analysis suggests guidelines for the design of
therapeutic immunoadhesins Furthermore applying our
model to experiments on Jurkat T cells suggests that an

IV DISCUSSION
We have developed an equilibrium model
for the
ligand-mediated adhesion of cells to surfaces Our model
incorporates potential heterogeneities in target cell epi-
tope density immobility of epitopes and the possibility
that ligand binding or adhesion alters the immobile epi-
tope fraction We have applied our model to experiments
on the alefacept-mediated adhesion of Jurkat T cells ex-
pressing CD2 to bilayer membranes containing the recep-
tor FcRIIIb a close relative of the relevant receptor on
natural killer cells We nd that our data are best de-
scribed by a model in which the immobile epitope fraction
is a function of the contact area between the target cell
and bilayer Nevertheless our best-t model still under-
estimates the epitope density on Jurkat T cells perhaps
indicating that other factors inuence CD2-mediated ad-
hesion and opening a direction for future study
Our results also suggest general guidelines for the de-
sign of immuno-adhesive molecules We nd that for
bivalent ligands the minimal ligand concentration L
required for adhesion is inversely related to the square
of the target cell epitope density illustrating the poten-
tial selectivity of these ligands We also show that L is
ABactive cellular process may be increasing CD2 immobility
in response to alefacept-mediated surface adhesion
