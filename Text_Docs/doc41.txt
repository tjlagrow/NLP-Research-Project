The observational link between Supermassive Black Holes SMBH
Abstract
and galaxies at low redshift seems to be very tight and statistically the global
evolution of star formation activity and BH accretion activity also seem to trace
each other closely However pinning down the co-evolution of galaxies and BH
on an object-by-object basis remains elusive I present results from new models
for the joint evolution of galaxies SMBH and AGN which may be able to help
resolve some of the observational puzzles A unique aspect of these models is
our treatment of self-regulated BH growth based on hydrodynamic simulations
of galaxy-galaxy mergers Although these models do quite well at reproducing
the observed evolution of galaxies they do not reproduce the observed history of
BH accretion predicting too much early accretion and not enough at late times
I suggest two possible resolutions to this problem
Introduction
There is strong evidence that the present-day properties of Supermassive Black
Holes SMBH and their host galaxies are tightly linked  for example we
observe a tight relationship between BH mass and the mass of the host spheroid
in nearby galaxies eg Haring  Rix 2004 However we do not yet know
whether this BH-galaxy mass relationship evolved over cosmic time or how
galaxies and SMBH arrived onto it Perhaps most importantly we do not yet
understand the physical origin of this relationship
Mergers have often been proposed as a mechanism that can drive gas
into the nuclei of galaxies and fuel both starbursts and black hole accretion
Hopkins et al 2005 used a large suite of hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy
mergers to characterize the episode of black hole growth and the AGN accretion
lightcurves in these events Hopkins et al 2006 then used this model to test
whether observed galaxy merger rates the build-up of redspheroidal galaxies
and AGN luminosity functions are consistent with the picture in which mergers
both trigger AGN activity and cause morphological and color transformation
They concluded that there is excellent statistical agreement between all of these
quantities
However establishing a direct link between mergers and AGN activity has
proven controversial Low luminosity AGN which are more common and can
be studied in more detail at relatively low redshift z  1 do not show strong
evidence for being predominantly in morphologically disturbed hosts or close
pairs eg Li et al 2006 Pierce et al 2007 Higher luminosity quasars seem to
be more often though not always associated with disturbed hosts or to have
close companions Bahcall et al 1997 Bennert et al 2008 Letawe et al 2008

but the samples with high resolution imaging are small It may be the case that
AGN are most easily identied in the very late stages of mergers when the two
nuclei have completely coalesced and most signs of morphological disturbance
have become invisible Especially at high redshift at the typically available
image sensitivity these very late stage merger remnants might well appear to
be normal spheroidal-type galaxies
Of course it is also possible even likely that there are multiple modes of
BH growth There are ample suggestions in the literature that AGN activity
could also be fed by bars or by stochastic accretion of cold gas in galactic nuclei
Hopkins  Hernquist 2006 presented a model for fueling of BH in isolated
disks by stochastic accretion and argued that while this fueling mode may be
important in lower luminosity objects and at late times most of the growth of
todays massive BH occurred in the merger-driven mode at high redshift
Another sign of co-evolution is that the global histories of star formation
and BH accretion seem to trace each other remarkably closely over the whole
range of lookback times over which these quantities have robust observational
estimates The global star formation rate density is almost exactly a factor of
2000 times the BH accretion rate density from redshift z  5 to the present
Moreover even when divided by mass or accretion rate matched populations
of galaxies and black holes at z  1 also trace one anothers activity Zheng et
in prep However we know that at least at z  1 the bulk of the star
formation activity is associated with isolated disks not mergers or spheroids
Bell et al 2005 Therefore it is also strange that these two kinds of activity
trace each other but do not seem to be occuring in the same types of objects
Zheng et al in prep
At higher redshift there may be a larger mismatch between between the
two kinds of activity Faucher-Giguere et al 2008 obtained constraints on the
global star formation density at 2  z  42 from the Lyman- forest opacity
in QSO spectra They found that the hydrogen photoionization rate and hence
the star formation rate density was remarkably at over this redshift range in
contrast to the sharply peaked QSO luminosity density which falls o sharply
at z  2 This may indicate that there is a time delay between SF activity and
QSO activity which is naturally explained in the merger picture any galaxy
with cold gas can form stars but galaxies have to wait for a major merger
before signicant accretion onto the BH can occur
One way to test this picture in which mergers are responsible for triggering
both AGN activity and morphological and spectrophotometric transformation
of galaxies is to build cosmological models that treat the growth of galaxies
black holes and AGN self-consistently
In addition many astronomers now
believe that the energy released by accreting black holes may play a crucial role
in regulating galaxy formation Here we describe one such semi-analytic model
for the joint formation of galaxies black holes and AGN and present some
predictions from these models
2 Unied Models for Galaxies Black Holes and AGN
The foundations of our model which pertain to the growth of structure in
the dark matter component and the formation of galaxies are described in
Co-evolution of Galaxies BH and AGN
Somerville  Primack 1999 Somerville et al 2001 and subsequent works
Briey the models are implemented within dark matter halo merger trees
and include approximate treatments for atomic cooling of gas photoionization
the formation of angular momentum supported disks including estimates of
their sizes and circular velocities star formation according to an empirical
Kennicutt Law supernova feedback and chemical evolution We have re-
cently implemented new machinery within this framework to treat black hole
growth and the associated AGN feedback Our new models are fully described
in Somerville et al 2008 S08 Here we give a very brief synopsis of the most
important new ingredients The models presented here are for a Concordance

Galaxy-galaxy Mergers We assume that galaxy mergers may induce a burst of
star formation and destroy any pre-existing disk component depending on the
mass ratio of the smaller to the larger galaxy  We parameterize the strength
and timescale of these bursts according to the results of a large suite of hy-
drodynamic simulations of galaxy mergers Robertson et al 2006b Cox et al
2008 as described in S08 Mergers can also heat and thicken or even destroy
a pre-existing disk component driving galaxies towards morphologically earlier
Hubble types We assume that the fraction of the pre-existing stars that is trans-
ferred from a disk to a spheroidal component is a strongly increasing function of
the merger mass ratio  such that minor mergers with   02 have little eect
and major mergers with   025 leave behind a spheroid-dominated remnant
In our model mergers also trigger
Bright Mode AGN and AGN-driven winds
the accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei Each top-
level halo in our merger trees is seeded with a black hole of mass Mseed 
100M Following a merger the black hole is allowed to grow at the Eddington
rate until the BH reaches a critical mass where the radiative energy being
emitted by the AGN becomes sucient to halt further accretion This self-
regulated treatment of black hole growth is based on hydrodynamic simulations
including BH growth and feedback Springel et al 2005b Di Matteo et al 2005
Hopkins et al 2007a and is described in more detail in S08 Energy radiated by
black holes during this bright quasar-like mode can also drive galactic-scale
winds clearing cold gas from the post-merger remnants Springel et al 2005a
Our model for momentum-driven AGN winds is described in S08
In addition to the rapid growth of BH in the merger-
Radio Mode Feedback
fueled radiatively ecient bright mode described above we assume that BH
also experience a low-Eddington-ratio radiatively inecient mode of growth
associated with ecient production of radio jets that can heat gas in a quasi-
hydrostatic hot halo The accretion rate in this phase is modelled assuming
Bondi accretion using the isothermal cooling ow solution of Nulsen  Fabian
2000 We then assume that the energy that eectively couples to and heats
the hot gas is given by Lheat  heat mradioc2 where mradio is the accretion
rate onto the BH   01 is the assumed conversion eciency of rest-mass into
energy and heat is a free parameter of order unity

3 The Global Evolution of Galaxies and Black Holes
We normalize the free parameters in our models to reproduce a key set of ob-
servational quantities at z  0 such as the stellar mass function the cold gas
fraction in disk galaxies and the stellar metallicity S08 We show our model
predictions and compare with observations for a broad range of low redshift
galaxy properties in S08
The relationship between galaxy mass and BH mass is clearly a key result
that our model should reproduce In our model this relationship is set by the
depth of the potential well of the galaxy at the time when the BH forms which
in turn is determined by the gas fraction of the progenitor galaxies of the last
merger More gas-rich progenitors suer more dissipation when they merge
and produce more compact remnants with deeper potential wells A deeper
potential well requires more energy and therefore a more massive BH in order
to halt further accretion and growth We see from Fig 1 that our ducial model
reproduces the observed slope and scatter of the MBHMsph black hole mass
vs spheroid mass relationship Our model also predicts that the MBHMsph
relation should evolve with time Because more gas-rich merger progenitors
produce remnants with larger black holes and the galaxies in our models were
signicantly more gas rich in the past galaxies have larger BH for their spheroid
mass than they do at the present day This leads to a relatively mild amount
of evolution of a factor of less than two since z  1 and a factor of about four
since z  3 Hopkins et al 2007a
Fig 2 shows the global star formation rate density of all galaxies predicted
by our models We show both the results of our ducial model as well as
a model in which galaxy formation has been suppressed in low-mass halos we
simply do not allow gas to cool in halos with mass less than 1011M We will

refer to the latter model as the low model for brevity The results of the low
model are similar to those from models with reduced small scale power eg with
lower 8 We have kept the same values for the free parameters in both models
Both models t the data fairly well from 0  z  1 and are about 01502
dex lower than the observational compilation of Hopkins  Beacom 2006 from
1  z  3 The ducial model predicts much more star formation at very high
redshift z  3 than the low model because much of the star formation at these
redshifts is taking place in low-mass halos
In the right panel of Fig 2 we show the complementary quantity star the
integrated cosmic stellar mass density The ducial model predicts a signicantly
earlier assembly of stars in galaxies than observations of high redshift galaxies
indicate However the low model produces very good agreement with the stellar
mass density as a function of redshift We note that this tension in the model
results is connected with a possible inconsistency between the two observational
data sets star formation rates and stellar masses that has been noted recently
in several papers eg Hopkins  Beacom 2006 Fardal et al 2007 Wilkins et al
2008 Dave 2008 One possible resolution of this tension can be obtained if the
stellar IMF has changed with time and was more top-heavy at high redshift

Fig 3 shows the integrated bolometric luminosity density of bright mode BH

minosity functions Hopkins et al 2007b We see that in our ducial model
QSO activity peaks at too high a redshift and falls o too rapidly at low red-

shift The low model predicts a rise and fall in QSO activity that is in some-
what better agreement with the data but still does not have quite the right
shape For comparison we plot the bright mode accretion rate in the models of
Croton et al 2006 which are similar to our ducial models in many respects
but treat BH growth and AGN feeding dierently We see that this model also
fails to reproduce the observations QSO activity peaks too early and does not
fall o rapidly enough at low redshift
This result is surprising because Hopkins et al 2008b found good agree-
ment with these same observations using the same model for BH growth that
we have implemented here We checked that the merger mass function predicted
by our model agrees with that in the Hopkins et al models The gas fractions
of our merger progenitors also agree well Eventually we realized that an im-
portant dierence in the assumptions made by Hopkins et al 2008b and those
contained in the models presented here was that in the Hopkins et al model
the black holes were allowed to grow from the seed mass to the nal mass in
each merger This eectively neglected the pre-existing BH that grew in earlier
mergers Put another way in our models by z  12 there is already a sig-
nicant amount of mass in spheroids in place each containing a massive black
hole If the pre-existing BH is already above the critical mass discussed above
then no AGN activity takes place Thus in our models many late mergers do
not trigger any AGN activity
As a check we re-ran our model assuming that the black holes are ejected
from the galaxy at the end of every merger The bright mode accretion history
now agrees much better with the observations at least in shape although the
normalization is a bit high Although this model may seem articial it is possible
that in some cases black holes are actually ejected by the gravitational rocket
mechanism which may impart kicks of several hundreds to 1000 kms to merging
BH Volonteri 2007 and references therein However this ejection of massive
BH can clearly have a problematic impact on the predicted MBHMsph relation
as shown in Fig refgmbh However the model shown here is extreme in that
BH are ejected from every galaxy after every merger It is possible that a more
physical implementation of the gravitational rocket mechanism could improve
the BH accretion history without leaving behind too many massive spheroids
with no BH or with very low mass BH which are not observed
Another possible resolution to this problem could perhaps be obtained if
spheroids are not formed as eciently in high redshift major mergers as we have
assumed here Because in our models the properties of the spheroid regulate
BH formation if spheroids form later then BH accretion will occur later as well
There are indications from a detailed analysis of the hydrodynamic merger simu-
lations that gas-rich mergers may often produce disk-like rather than spheroidal
remnants Robertson et al 2006a Hopkins et al 2008a Because our disks tend
to be more gas rich at high redshift this eect would indeed shift spheroid for-
mation to later times We are currently working on implementing this eect in
our models

5 Summary and Conclusions
We have presented some rst predictions from new models for the joint evolution
of galaxies black holes and AGN Our models dier from other semi-analytic
models in the literature in that we have implemented self-regulated BH growth
based on the results of high resolution hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy merg-
We showed that our ducial model does a fairly good job of reproducing the
global star formation history but overproduces the stellar mass in place at high
redshift A low model with cooling suppressed in low-mass halos or a model
with reduced small-scale power produces good agreement with the stellar mass
density history but does not agree as well with the star formation history This
reects an internal tension between these two data sets which may be due to
systematic errors arising from a time-varying stellar Initial Mass Function
We found that our model which does fairly well at reproducing galaxy
observations at both low and high redshift fails to reproduce the form of the
BH accretion history as traced by the bolometric quasar luminosity density In
our models QSO activity peaks at too high a redshift and falls o too rapidly
at low redshift The models of Croton et al 2006 also fail to reproduce this
behavior We suggested two possible resolutions to this problem 1 Black Holes
are at least sometimes ejected from their host galaxy following a merger or
2 major mergers at high redshift are not as ecient at producing spheroidal
remnants as we have assumed
