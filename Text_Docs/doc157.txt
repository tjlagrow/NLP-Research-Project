ABSTRACT
The study of PopI and PopII indicators in galaxies has a profound impact on our understand-
ing of galaxy evolution Their present z  0 ratio suggests that the star formation history of
galaxies was primarily dictated by their global mass Since 1989 Luis Carrasco and I spent most
of our sleepless nights gathering H and near infrared surface photometry of galaxies in the local
Universe and focused most of our scientic career on these two indicators trying to convince the
community that the mass was the key parameter to their evolution We were unsuccessful until
in 2004 the Sloan team rediscovered this phenomenon and named it downsizing
Subject headings Galaxies evolution  Galaxies fundamental parameters
The collaboration with Luis Carrasco dates
back to 1989 when we joined our eorts to re-
juvenate the 21m telescope at San Pedro Martir
SPM by dressing it up with an early CCD by
Photometrics equipped with narrow-band lters
for redshifted H and with the Boller  Chievens
spectrograph that is still among the instrumenta-
tion oered at SPM
Since then our fruitful collaboration brought us to
work together on many projects that eventually
gave birth to 13 publications
The rst yet most important discovery we made
quite serendipitously at SPM was that the galaxy
CGCG 224-038 which was known as a starburst
is probably so because it is under the action of
harassment see g 1 It was therefore quite
natural to baptize it as the Playboy galaxy for
the glory of Ben Moore et al 1999
Later on we started some multifrequency survey-
ing of signicant samples of galaxies in the local
Universe following one of the preferred and most
productive activities of Luis We concentrated
at obtaining surface photometry in H and NIR
the former was aimed at quantifying the massive
ongoing formation of young stars the latter the
oldest stellar population The survey is still in
progress
Since the pioneering work of Recillas et al 1990
1991 and of Gavazzi et al
1996 it resulted
among other things that the NIR band H was
providing us with a very robust tool to infer the
dynamical mass of galaxies up to their optical
In other words ML of spirals was found
roughly constant in the infrared as opposite to
bluer bands
Following the seminal work of Gavazzi et al
1996 of Boselli et al
2001 and Scodeggio
et al 2002 and exploiting the data-set that we
collected in the past years of collaboration with
Luis Carrasco in the present paper I wish to put
together all possible evidences of downsizing
among disk galaxies 1
In other words I will
present and discuss six independent lines of evi-
dence eg 6 scaling laws all suggesting that the
galaxy mass is the principal parameter governing
the evolution of these systems These ideas are
receiving some late recognition as the November
2008 issue of Nature reports two papers by Disney
et al 2008 and by van den Bergh 2008a that
are focused on these issues and conrm our earlier
ndings The very existence of such correlations
provides a challenge for hierarchical models of
galaxy evolution Cole at al 2000 since quot-
ing van den Bergh 2008a

1 The data
11 The sample
For the purpose of the present investigation
galaxies have been selected from the Goldmine
Database Gavazzi et al
2003 and references
therein according to the following criteria
1 they belong to the Virgo Cancer Coma or
A1367 clusters or they lie in the bridge between
the Coma Cluster and A1367
2 they have morphological type Sa or later
3 they have a measurement available for the total
magnitude in H band to provide the dynamical
4 they have a measurement available for the in-
tegrated HI mass
There are 868 galaxies meeting these require-
ments When we divide the sample according to
the HI deciency parameter Haynes  Giovanelli
1986 we nd 463 galaxies with HIDef  03
unperturbed sample and 251 with HIDef  04
perturbed sample the interval 03  HIDef 
04 contains 154 objects that have been deliber-
ately omitted Needless to say the majority of
galaxies with normal HI content belong to the
bridge between Coma and A1367 and to the loose
Cancer cluster while that of HI decient objects
is made of members of the two richest clusters
Virgo and Coma
It should be emphasized that
all galaxies except in the Virgo cluster are op-
tically selected according to the criteria of the
CGCG catalogue Zwicky et al 1961-68 In the
nearby Virgo cluster the optically selected sample
comes from the deeper VCC catalogue of Binggeli
et al 1985 that is complete down to mB  180
mag thus it includes dwarf Irregular and BCD
galaxies
12 The analyzed parameters
The present section lists and describes the pa-
rameters that are analyzed in this paper
According to Gavazzi et al 1996 the dynamical
mass within the optical radius of disk galaxies is
logMdyn  logLH  07 This quantity is plotted
in the horizontal axis of g2-7
The classication of galaxy nuclei among normal
AGNs or LINERS is taken from Decarli et al
2007
The H EW in g 3 determines the intensity
of the H line over the continuum thus it pro-
Fig 1 An H NET frame of the Playboy
galaxy CGCG 224-038 taken with the 21m at
assembled through the chaotic merging of dark
matter halos one would expect the properties of
individual galaxies to be determined by numerous
independent factors such as star-forming history
merger history mass angular momentum size
and environment The fact that most proper-
ties of galaxies seem to scale simply by their mass
provides a severe challenge
The six parameters that we will show to correlate
or anti correlate with the system mass are 1
the HI mass 2 the current star formation rate
per unit mass 3 the B-H color index 4 the NIR
eective surface brightness 5 the light concentra-
tion index and 6 the presence of nuclear features
in the R band
Studying all correlations we will discriminate be-
tween normal and AGN hosting systems in-
cluding LINERS
Furthermore aiming at clarifying if the scaling
laws are sensitive to the galaxy environment all
correlations will be shown separately for nor-
mal unperturbed galaxies left panels and for
perturbed objects The latter discrimination
is according to the HI deciency parameter that
is known to provide a sensitive probe of the en-
vironmental conditions Boselli  Gavazzi 2006
vides a measure of the star formation rate per unit
red continuum light ie a quantity that is pro-
portional to the birth-rate parameter b ie the
present to past star formation ratio Kennicutt et
al 1994 The H data are from Gavazzi et al
2006and references therein
The NIR mean eective surface brightness e in
g 5 is the mean surface brightness within the
eective radius Gavazzi et al 2000
The NIR light concentration index C31 in g 6
is the ratio of two radii that contain 75 and 25
 of the total light respectively Gavazzi et al
It is sensitive to the presence of central
light concentrations ie bulges and nuclei Pure
exponential disks have C31  3 while C31  3 is
found among galaxies with signicant central en-
hancements
The nuclearity parameter in g 7 is derived from
the dierence between the mean central surface
brightness within the seeing disk and the surface
brightness at the radius that contains 25  of the
total R band light Strong nuclearity parameters
 1 are associated with relevant nuclear features
in the R band
analysis
Fig 2 left shows that the mass of HI gas
alone H2 is neglected here represents a relevant
fraction of the order of 15 of the total mass
for galaxies less massive than  1010M  see also
Gavazzi et al 2008 Above this value the gaseous
fraction becomes progressively smaller with in-
creasing mass In this regime a large fraction of
galaxies hosts an AGN Decarli et al 2007
As expected among the perturbed HI decient
sample right there is a signicant reduction of
the HI mass at any mass and the relation becomes
a scatter diagram
Fig 3 left shows that the massive star forma-
tion rate normalized to the continuum luminosity
shows one order of magnitude scatter for galaxies
less massive than  1010M  Above this thresh-
old it decreases signicantly with increasing mass
see also Lee at al 2007 This indicates that
downsizing is shaping the Hubble sequence of
giant spirals Among the perturbed HI decient
sample right there is a signicant increase of
the spread and a mean shift toward lower star
formation rate at any mass indicating that what-
ever mechanism produces the ablation of primor-
dial gas ram pressure or other interactions it
quenches signicantly the star formation of galax-
ies that are members to rich clusters see also

4 left shows the B-H color-luminosity
relation for spiral and irregular galaxies with
normal HI content As opposed to a similar color
trend for EdE galaxies with a much shallower
slope that is entirely induced by the metallicity-
luminosity and color-metallicity relations
color-luminosity eect for spirals spans 4 mag
in B-H reecting a genuine change in population
from the dwarfs to the most massive galaxies This
eect is consistent with the idea that downsizing
has been acting for several giga years Notice that
the color-luminosity relation cannot be attributed
to AGN feedback as proposed by Schawinski et al
2006 for early-type galaxies since it holds in the
whole luminosity interval including the dwarfs
where AGNs are absent The same relation for
HI decient galaxies right shows a larger spread
but is not qualitatively dierent
Fig 5 left shows the H band eective surface
brightness mean within Re vs mass relation
Notice that this structural scale relation holds
identical for normal and decient eg
isolated
and cluster galaxies irrespective of the presence
of AGNs at their interior Old stars are more
tightly packed in massive galaxies another ef-
fect of downsizing
Fig 6 and Fig 7 are discussed together as they
are so strongly correlated one another The con-
centration index is in fact sensitive to central light
cusps associated with bulge-like structures The
nuclearity index is sensitive to smaller nuclear en-
hancements on the scale of the seeing Both how-
ever indicate that the presence of central cusps in
disk galaxies is strongly non-linearly increasing
with the system mass Also for this relation the
environment seems to play a very marginal role

3 discussion and conclusions
Adopting the principle that scientic models
should rely on the least number of assumptions
it is reasonable to conclude that the lines of ev-
idence presented in Section 3 nd a natural in-
terpretation under the simple hypothesis that the

star formation history of disk galaxies is regulated
primarily by the system mass eg if the eciency
of protogalaxy collapse increases with the mass
according to the seminal ideas of Sandage 1986
Gavazzi et al 2002 have worked out these ideas
by performing SED tting of disk galaxies in the
Virgo cluster They concluded that adopting fam-
ilies of star formation histories that are function of

a single parameter   such that their time evo-
lution is as shown in Fig 8  derived from SED
tting is found inversely proportional to the sys-
tem mass In other words without invoking sec-
ond order feedback mechanism from supernovae
and central AGNs downsizing follows naturally
assuming that large mass galaxies have had an ear-
lier shorter and more intense star formation ac-
