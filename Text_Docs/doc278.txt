Abstract New observations in favour of a signicant role of secular evolution are reviewed
central star formation boosted in pseudo-bulge barred galaxies relations between bulge and
disk evidence for rejuvenated bulges Numerical simulations have shown that secular evolution
can occur through a cycle of bar formation and destruction in which the gas plays a major role
Since bars are weakened or destroyed in gaseous disks the high frequency of bars observed today
requires external cold gas accretion to replenish the disk and allow a new bar formation The
rate of gas accretion from external laments is compatible with what is observed in cosmological
simulations

1 Role of secular evolution
Secular evolution is one of the three scenarios for galaxy formation and evolution In
a rst one monolithic collapse gas clouds in free fall form stars so quickly that the
resulting system is ellipsoidal Disks then form afterward through gas accretion around
these bulges In a second scenario hierarchical formation gas clouds have time to settle in
rotating disks through dissipation and form stars in thin spiral disks which after several
minor mergers or a major merger can also result in an ellipsoidal system The secular
evolution scenario also considers that spiral disks form rst then non-axisymmetric waves
bars and spirals with their associated gravity torques and resonances drive internal
evolution and in particular mass concentration towards the centre and formation of
bulges from the stellar disk Spiral disks are continuously replenished through external
gas accretion
11 Star formation and pseudobulges
The bulges just formed out of disk stars in barred galaxies are likely to correspond to
the observed pseudobulges which have characteristics intermediate between a classical
bulge or Elliptical and normal disks Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Their light distri-
bution has a Sersic index n 1-2 n1 for disks and n4 for ellipticals their attening
is also intermediate with box-peanut shapes and their kinematics reveal more rotation
support than classical bulges
Fisher 2006 has distinguished pseudobulges from classical ones in a sample of 50
galaxies from HST images He used the PAH features in the 8 micron band as a tracer
of star formation from Spitzer observations He founds that the central  15kpc star
formation is more important in galaxies with pseudo-bulges Moreover the eect is more
spectacular when there exists a strong bar Regan et al 2006 found similarly that
pseudo-bulge galaxies of the SINGS sample are always associated with large central 8
micron emission while there is no PAH concentration in classical bulge ones

12 Size of bars and stellar ages
The observed relation between the bulge and disk characteristic radial scales MacArthur
Courteau  Holtzman 2003 suggests a signicant role for secular evolution There is some
scatter in the relation but if bulges were entirely formed by minor mergers no relation
would be expected With respect to R25 the bar radius ranges from 02 to 04 Marinova
 Jogee 2006 and bars are longer in early-types than late-types Erwin 2005
There is also a relation between metallicity and velocity dispersion in bulges corre-
sponding to the relation between metallicity and mass but no relation age-metallicity
as in elliptical galaxies Bulges have a tendency to have smaller mean age and a lower
Fe ratio indicating a more continuous formation with gas infall Proctor et al 2000
Proctor  Sansom 2002 A recent study by Thomas  Davies 2006 emphasizes that
bulges are not in general very old but rejuvenated systems The inuence of disks is
particularly visible for late-types Since the stars forming the pseudo-bulge are elevated
from the disk by vertical resonances with the bar the bulge stellar populations reect
those of the inner disk which could be relatively old in early-type galaxies or galaxies
with little gas infall This could explain the large range of abundances and ages
Pseudo-bulges are observed in early-types as well examples such as NGC 4593SBb
and NGC 7690 Sab are given by Kormendy et al 2006 Starbursts are visible in these
galaxies without any companion and it is suggested that star formation is episodic
Gas and dust are observed to accumulate in the nuclear ring of NGC 4593 which will
form stars in the future
2 Bar destruction and reformation role of gas
It has been noticed for a long time in many simulations of disk galaxies with a few
percent of mass in gas that the inow of gas towards the center was weakening or
destroying the bar Friedli 1994 Berentzen et al 1998 Bournaud  Combes 2002 Hozumi
 Hernquist 2005 However it was believed that the weakening was due entirely to
Secular evolution in galaxies
Figure 2 Schematic bar destructionreformation cycle 1 A stellar bar forms in a cold gaseous
disk and the bar gravity torques drive the gas inwards from corotation CR at the outer end
of the bar 2 As long as the bar is there gas between CR and OLR outer Lindblad resonance
is driven outwards The gas accreted from cosmic laments is stalled outside OLR 3 The
bar is destroyed by the angular momentum accepted from the gas inow Now bar torques are
suppressed and the external gas can inow and replenish the disk of this unbarred galaxy 4
A new bar instability develops in the new cold disk Its pattern speed is slightly higher and the
bar smaller with respect to the disk scalelength
the central mass concentration CMC build in by the gas inow A CMC changes the
inner mass distribution destroys the orbital structure supporting the bar and enhances
the frequency of chaotic orbits Hasan et al 1993 Recently it was emphasized that
realistic CMC in disk galaxies are not able to destroy the bar Shen  Sellwood 2004
Athanassoula et al 2005 but the main destruction mechanism is instead the gas inow
itself The gas is driven in by the bar torques and reciprocally torques the bar The
angular momentum lost by the gas is taken up by the bar wave which then weakens
Bournaud et al 2005
The eect of gas depends on its physics its dissipative character and therefore on the
assumed cooling when isothermal it is with more contrast that gas follows spiral arms
in the barred potential and the gravity torques are stronger If it remains adiabatic it
has a behaviour more similar to the stellar component Debattista et al 2006 gure 1
3 Bar frequency and gas accretion
Since bars waves are self-destroyed it is possible to imagine a cycle of bar formation
and destruction such as described in gure 2 A new bar can grow if the disk of cold gas
reforms through external gas accretion The observed frequency of bars can constrain the
amount of gas accretion required
Several authors have recently calculated the bar frequency from near-infrared samples
in particular the OSU NIR sample Eskrige et al 2002 Whyte et al 2002 have computed
the bar strength from the ellipticity of isophotes and Block et al 2002 have computed
F Combes
the ratio Qb of the tangential to radial forces from the potential derived from the red
image Both nd a dearth of non-barred galaxies and a large abundance of strong bars
The paucity of weak bars is also found in dierent samples Buta et al 2004 Marinova
 Jogee 2006 the majority of galaxies are barred 75 and most of them 80 are
strongly barred
To maintain this high frequency of bars continuous accretion at a large rate is required
The majority of the external gas cannot come from companions since galaxy interactions
heat the disks Toth  Ostriker 1992 What is required instead is a source of continuous
cold gas accretion from the laments in the near environment of galaxies Cosmological
accretion is compatible with doubling the mass in 10 Gyr Semelin  Combes 2005
4 Conclusion
Secular evolution plays a fundamental role in mass assembly of spiral galaxies through
the intermediate of bars pseudo-bulge formation and external gas accretion A gravity
feedback mechanism self-regulate the evolution and a cycle of bar formationdestruction
can be accompanied by episodic starburst and AGN fueling
Galaxy interactions and mergers play a major role in the formation of massive spheroids
but the hierarchical scenario alone cannot explain the dominance in number of spiral
galaxies with young and thin disks Essentially spiral galaxies are concerned by secular
evolution and in particular those of intermediate types with a small bulge Early-type
galaxies can be re-transformed back in more late type objects through gas accretion so
can also be concerned by this scenario according to their environment
