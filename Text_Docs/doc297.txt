ABSTRACT
We identify isolated galaxy triplets in a volume-limited sample from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 Our nal sample has 80 galaxy systems in the
redshift range 004cid54zcid5401 brighter than Mr  205  5 log h70 Spectral synthe-
sis results and WHAN and BPT diagnostic diagrams were employed to classify the
galaxies in these systems as star-forming active nuclei or passiveretired
Our results suggest that the brightest galaxies drive the triplet evolution as ev-
idenced by the strong correlations between properties as mass assembly and mean
stellar population age with triplet properties Galaxies with intermediate luminosity
or the faintest one within the triplet seem to play a secondary role Moreover the
relation between age and stellar mass of galaxies is similar for these galaxies but dif-
ferent for the brightest galaxy in the system Most of the triplet galaxies are passive
or retired according to the WHAN classication Low mass triplets present dierent
fractions of WHAN classes when compared to higher mass triplets A census of WHAN
class combinations shows the dominance of star-forming galaxies in low mass triplets
while retired and passive galaxies prevail in high-mass systems We argue that these
results suggest that the local environment through galaxy interactions driven by the
brightest galaxy is playing a major role in triplet evolution

1 INTRODUCTION
The current inationary cold dark matter CDM frame-
work predicts that galaxies and large scale structures had
their origin in primordial density uctuations in the early
Universe eg Peebles 1980 Write  Frenk 1991 This hi-
erarchical scenario of structure formation also implies that
galaxies start their formation rst and as times goes by
larger and larger structures are being built by gravitational
processes such as laments walls and clusters of galax-
ies the so-called cosmic web Zeldovich et al 1982 Gott
III et al 2005 Aragon-Calvo et al 2010 In this bottom-

up scenario groups clusters and superclusters of galaxies
were formed in a relatively recent time when compared to
galaxies themselves Large scale structures have a strong in-
uence on the evolution of galaxies that they harbour ie
galaxy properties in dense environments are statistically dis-
tinct from those in voids Grogin  Geller 1999 Rojas et
al 2004 Consequently large scale structures can be con-
sidered as cosmic laboratories being suitable objects to
investigate how galaxies evolve Balogh et al 1999
Many studies focus on galaxy clusters de la Torre et al
2011 or compact groups Coenda et al 2015 due to the
strong inuence they have on the evolution of their galaxies
But most of the galaxies in the Universe are in smaller or less
conspicuous structures such as pairs and triplets of galaxies
Costa-Duarte MV OMill A L Duplancic F Sodre Jr L Lambas D G
Karachentsev 1972 Lambas et al 2003 These galaxy sys-
tems are suitable sites to investigate galaxy evolution since
they are generally in low-density environments and the in
situ interaction between the members is one of the main pro-
cesses in action Galaxy mergers are an important mecha-
nism aecting galaxies and may lead to complex stellar pop-
ulations due to multiple starburst episodes Indeed a star
formation enhancement is commonly reported at the end of
the galaxy merger process Owers et al 2007 Robotham et
al 2013 However the way these galaxies evolve is not fully
understood It is also necessary to invoke internal mecha-
nisms to reproduce some observed galaxy properties one of
them is active galactic nuclei hereafter AGNs feedback
which can suppress or trigger star formation due to a
large amount of energy released to the interstellar medium
Fabian 2012
Recently OMill et al 2012 have compiled a catalogue
of triplets of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
Data Release 7 SDSS-DR7 Abazajian et al 2007 provid-
ing a spectroscopic and photometric sample of triplet sys-
tem candidates Further analysis carried out by Duplancic
et al 2013 based on photometric colours and star forma-
tion activity indicates that galaxy triplets present similar
properties to compact groups and that these systems com-
prising luminous galaxies are actually an extension of com-
pact galaxy groups with a smaller number of members A
dynamical analysis employing the AA-diagram Agekyan 
Anosova 1968 and mock catalogues also indicates that their
congurations provide better conditions for interaction and
mergers between galaxy members Duplancic et al 2015
A variety of techniques has been developed in order to
obtain galaxy properties Empirical spectral synthesis by
tting an observed galaxy spectrum with a linear combi-
nation of simple stellar populations SSPs plus extinction
attenuation represents a powerful technique to extract in-
tegrated stellar population parameters such as mean ages
and metallicities from a sample of galaxies Bica 1988 Cid
Fernandes et al 2001 Tojeiro et al 2007
Diagnostic diagrams represent another useful tool com-
monly used to investigate the mechanisms responsible for
the emission lines observed in galaxy spectra The BPT dia-
gram Baldwin Phillips  Terlevich 1981 is the most used
diagram for classifying emission line galaxies accordingly
with the dominant photoionization source making use of
the O iii 5007H versus N ii 6584H plane However
emission line galaxies without signicant O iii 5007 emis-
sion such as retired and passive galaxies cannot be distin-
guished from AGNs with the BPT diagram eg Stasinska
et al 2015 Whereas passive galaxies have negligible emis-
sion lines retired galaxies are mainly characterized by pre-
vailing old stellar populations and the presence of weak emis-
sion lines which are usually explained by Hot Low-Mass
Evolved Stars HOLMES Binette et al 1994 To distin-
guish these low ionization galaxies from high ionization ob-
jects AGNs Cid Fernandes et al 2011 have shown that
an ecient way is by using the so-called WHAN diagram
ie the equivalent width of H versus N ii 6584H plane
This diagram was rstly named WHAN by Cid Fernandes
et al 2011 who introduced this acronym WHAN for sim-
plicity see their Introduction section
The main purpose of this paper is to implement these
techniques to investigate the properties of isolated triplet
galaxy systems and their members The spectral synthesis
provides stellar population features of the galaxies while the
diagnostic diagrams allow the classication of their main
photoionization source We will show that the information
extracted from galaxy spectra with these two techniques are
useful to evaluate what kind of galaxies form triplets and
how their properties are correlated to the properties of their
host systems
This paper is structured as follows In Section 2 we de-
scribe our volume-limited sample presenting the spectro-
scopic and photometric data and the corrections applied to
the data Section 3 presents a brief description of the selec-
tion criteria used to identify the isolated galaxy triplets in
our sample In Section 4 the spectral synthesis and emission
line measurements are described The general properties of
galaxy triplets are presented and discussed in Section 5 In
this section we present a concept valuable for our discussion
the luminosity hierarchy of the triplet members Indeed in
Section 52 we present an analysis of the mass assembly
stellar mass and age of galaxies classied according to their
hierarchy and triplet stellar mass Section 6 presents the
emission line analysis by using the WHAN and BPT dia-
grams Finally our conclusions and nal remarks are estab-
lished in Section 7 Appendix A discuss how spectroscopic
incompleteness aects the identication of galaxy triplets
Throughout this paper the following cosmology is
adopted whenever necessary H0  70 km s1Mpc1 and
m  k  03 07 00
The galaxy sample analyzed in this work was drawn from
the Data Release 10 of Sloan Digital Sky Survey1 SDSS-
DR10 Ahn et al 2014 This survey covers an additional
3100 sqdeg of the sky over the previous release and in-
cludes spectra obtained with the new spectrographs devel-
oped for APOGEE and BOSS projects The SDSS-DR10
provides a public database of roughly two million galax-
ies with 5 broadband photometry ugriz and optical spec-
troscopy from 3800A to 9200A at the observed-frame with
a spectral resolution of R1500 at 3800A The SDSS optical
spectra is a treasure trove for studies on stellar populations
and on emission line properties of the galaxy populations
The volume-limited sample employed for the detec-
tion of triplet systems of galaxy candidates at low red-
shift comprises galaxies brighter than r-band 1777 and
Mr  205  5 log h70 with spectroscopic redshift in the
range 004cid54zcid5401 Under these constraints our galaxy sam-
ple consists of 162172 objects
Notice that in this work we adopt the ModelMag magni-
tude This magnitude is estimated by tting two distinct ux
proles and by selecting the prole with higher likelihood
in the r-band This magnitude is more appropriate for ex-
tended objects and also provides more robust galaxy colours
The magnitudes were corrected by extinction osets values
adopted from Doi et al 2010 and the k-correction following
the empirical k-corrections presented by OMill et al 2011

3 TRIPLET IDENTIFICATION
We have obtained a sample of galaxy triplet candidates in
the volume-limited sample described in the previous section
with the algorithm developed by OMill et al 2012
We consider as triplets the systems with three galaxies
with spectroscopic observations that are close in projected
separation rp cid54200 h1kpc from the centre of the system
dened as the position of the brightest galaxy of the triplet
and have radial velocity dierences with respect to the cen-
tral galaxy V  cid54 700 kms1
As our goal is to identify isolated galaxy triplets it is
necessary an isolation criteria that ensures that there are no
signicant external perturbations acting on the galaxy sys-
tems For this reason we impose the condition that there
are no bright Mr  205  5 log h70 neighbours within
05h1M pc from the triplet centre and with the same re-
striction on V  used to identify triplet members Duplan-
cic et al 2015 used these criteria to isolate triplet galaxy
systems Moreover 95 of the systems are at distances
greater than 3h1M pc from their massive neighbours im-
plying that our isolation criterion is eective in selecting
systems far away from groups and clusters of galaxies We
also impose an additional restriction that within 1h1M pc
and with the same restriction on V  used to identify
triplet members there can be only one galaxy brighter than
Mr  205  5 log h70 and this cannot be brighter than
the brightest galaxy in the triplet Under these consider-
ations the nal galaxy triplet sample contains 97 isolated
systems with 291 spectroscopic galaxies in the redshift range
004cid54zcid5401
Spectroscopic incompleteness has to be taken into ac-
count in the triplet identication Due to observational is-
sues Strauss et al 2002 not all objects classied as galaxies
and with r  1777 in the SDSS survey are spectroscopically
observed As a consequence some of the systems previously
ccid13 2014 RAS MNRAS 000 112
identied may not be truly isolated triplets but quartets
or more complex galaxy congurations In order to quan-
tify this eect on the triplet catalogue we used photometric
redshifts to identify potential photometric members of the
systems The procedure adopted for this purpose is fully de-
scribed in Appendix A From this analysis we discarded 14
systems from our triplet catalogue because they presented
potential photometric members that would break our isola-
tion criteria
Additionally after the spectral analysis three other
triplets were excluded from our sample because they in-
cluded galaxies classied as Seyfert type I and for them some
stellar population properties mainly stellar mass could not
be determined see section 4 In summary our nal sample
comprises 80 galaxy systems or 240 galaxies with spectral
synthesis and emission line features determined
The high degree of isolation of the triplets can be appre-
ciated in Figure 1 showing two galaxy triplets at z  0055
and z  0090 Galaxies with redshift determination are
marked with a red box and triplets members are indicated
with white circles In the gure on the left we can see a
galaxy with spectroscopy but its redshift is z  0269 which
leaves it out of our isolation criteria
4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
41 Empirical Spectral Synthesis
The SDSS spectra were downloaded from the SDSS-
DR10 database corrected by galactic extinction using the
Cardelli et al 1989 extinction law and transformed to
the rest-frame Each spectrum was then analyzed with the
STARLIGHT spectral synthesis code Cid Fernandes et al
2005 A set of simple stellar populations from the library of
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 with 150 elements 25 ages and 5
metallicities was used with ages between 106 and 18109
yr and metallicities between ZZcid12 0005 and 25 In or-
der to carry out the spectral tting the STARLIGHT code
uses a spectral mask to exclude regions around the emission
lines and consequently only the stellar continuum is tted
Representative stellar population features were dened using
the resulting spectral synthesis light vector xi The stellar
population light-weighted age associated to a spectrum is
dened as
NSSPcid88
agram WHAN the identication of the ionization mech-
anism allows the classication of galaxies as star-forming
AGNs mostly Seyfert II and LINERS passive galaxies
without signicant emission lines or retired galaxies ob-
jects whose emission is attributed to advanced stages of
stellar evolution This analysis can be done by using the
ux ratio N iiH and the equivalent width of H In this
emission line representation galaxies with dierent ioniza-
tion mechanisms occupy distinct loci

5 GENERAL CONFIGURATION OF GALAXY
where the parameters xi and logti represent the light con-
tribution at 4020A and the age of the i-th SSP element of
the spectral library respectively It is important to mention
that all weighted ages are truncated for values lower than
the age of the Universe t cid54 135  109 years in order to
get ages consistent with the cosmology adopted The SSPs
older than the Universe are included in the spectral base
because they can provide a better spectral tting specially
of early-type galaxies
Stellar masses are calculated by taking into account
aperture eects Strauss et al 2002 The SDSS ber has
a 3 diameter in the sky plane and then cannot cover all the
extension of most galaxies The ber ux and consequently
the stellar masses derived from these ber spectra are conse-
quently underestimated To correct this eect a procedure
introduced by Cid Fernandes et al 2005 is adopted This
correction compensates for the light which is lost by the ber
by multiplying the stellar mass inside the ber by the factor
1004zf iberzmodel where zf iber is the magnitude inside the
ber and zmodel is the ModelMag both at the z-band This
photometric band is chosen because the old stellar popula-
tions which are usually responsible for most of the stellar
mass present their main emission at this band This correc-
tion assumes that the mass-to-light ratio inside and outside
the region covered by the ber is the same
42 Emission lines measures
With the goal of investigating the emission lines properties
of galaxies in triplets the equivalent widths EW and uxes
of O iii 5007 H H and N ii 6584 lines were measured
by subtracting the model spectrum from the observed spec-
trum and then by tting Gaussian proles to these emission
lines more details can be found in Mateus et al 2006 Cid
Fernandes et al 2010 We consider as reliable measurements
those emission lines with signal-to-noise greater than 3 and
a fraction of bad pixels in the emission line region lower
than 25 A fraction of galaxies 61 objects could not ll
these conditions and a visual inspection of their spectra was
carried out This inspection has indicated that 58 objects
are passive galaxies with no signicant emission lines and
predominantly old stellar populations Three galaxies were
classied as Seyfert I with strong and broad emission lines
Passive and Seyfert I galaxies are not plotted in the WHAN
diagram see Figure 5 either due to the absence of emission
lines or because these emission lines could not be tted by
Gaussian proles
The emission line analysis was done with a diagnostic
diagram proposed by Cid Fernandes et al 2011 In this di-
TRIPLETS
The stellar mass in a galaxy triplet is an important quan-
tity for an overall characterization of the system It is calcu-
lated by summing the stellar mass obtained for each mem-
ber galaxy one of the outputs of the STARLIGHT synthe-
sis In the analysis below we consider three stellar mass
bins divided by the 333 and 666 percentiles of the
stellar mass distribution or the intervals logM1152
1152logM1172 and logM1172 in solar units
respectively In this section we dene the luminosity extent
of triplets and verify how it correlates with triplet parame-
ters such as total stellar mass and luminosity and mean age
of the brightest galaxy In the second part of this section
we use again STARLIGHT outputs to investigate the stellar
mass assembly of the systems Finally we discuss the rela-
tion between mean stellar age and triplet stellar mass for
the galaxies in our sample
51 The luminosity extent of triplets
To analyze each triplet it is useful to consider the luminos-
ity hierarchy of its members We have classied each galaxy
in a triplet as the brightest the intermediate or the faintest
galaxy of the system accordingly to its r-band luminosity
This classication is relative to each system ie the bright-
est object in a triplet may be fainter than the faintest mem-
ber of another triplet
The relative luminosity extent of a system is dened
as the ratio between the r-band luminosities of its bright-
est and faintest galaxies L31  Lrf aintestLrbrightest We
have also considered a second hierarchical parameter for
measuring the dominance of the brightest galaxy and de-
ned as the fraction of the brightest galaxy luminosity with
respect to the triplet luminosity fL  LrbrightestLrtriplet
Since we noticed that both parameters are strongly corre-
lated the Spearmans correlation coecient is -0925 with
the probability of the null hypothesis of absence of corre-
lation P H0  103 our results are shown only for the
parameter L31 Our results would be similar if we had used
is found
Firstly an anti-correlation between triplet stellar mass
r P H0 
and the parameter L31
0369  103 as shown at the top of Figure 2 This re-
sult suggests that higher mass triplets tend to present lower
values of L31 ie the higher the dominance of the brightest
galaxy is over the other members On the other hand low
stellar mass triplets have higher values of L31 ie the mem-
bers have similar luminosities The median value of L31 for
triplets in the most massive bin is 026 similar to the value
ccid13 2014 RAS MNRAS 000 112
Dissecting galaxy triplets in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10
adopted by Lambas et al 2012 to separate between ma-
jor and minor galaxy pairs Some of the triplets in the most
massive bin present extreme values such as L31 02 or less
ie the luminosity ratio between the brightest and faintest
galaxies is roughly ve or more It is important to high-
light that this luminosity ratio represents a dierence lower
than 2 in the magnitude scale which is the limit adopted by
several authors eg Sales  Lambas 2005 to select galaxy
satellites
The middle panel of Figure 2 shows the r-band absolute
magnitude of the brightest galaxy Mr as a function of the
triplet stellar mass In this gure circles represent triplets
and their sizes are proportional to the parameter L31 An
anti-correlation is found r P H0  0570  103
showing that the brightest triplet galaxies are more lumi-
nous or more massive in more massive triplets This con-
guration is expected in the hierarchical scenario acting in
systems simpler than groups and clusters Moreover one
can notice that as the absolute magnitude of the brightest
galaxy increases the dominance parameter L31 decreases
for a certain triplet mass value
The lower panel of Figure 2 shows an initial stellar pop-
ulation analysis of our triplet sample From this gure it
can be appreciated a trend between the age weighted by
the light of the brightest member  logt L and the
stellar mass of the triplet with a Spearman correlation of
r P H0  0309 0005 Brightest galaxies with older
stellar populations galaxies are common in massive triplets
but less prevalent in the lower mass bin If the same analysis
is done using the faintest galaxy of the triplet no signicant
correlation is found This suggests that the triplet proper-
ties are mainly correlated to the brightest galaxy Fainter
members present a secondary role on triplets properties
We now explore the spectral properties of triplet galaxy
systems with other techniques such as the mass assembly
history obtained from spectral synthesis analysis and the
emission line diagnostic diagrams
52 The stellar mass assembly
In this section we consider how the mass assembly history of
the triplets can provide a more detailed understanding of the
evolution of their galaxies We rst discuss how the empirical
spectral synthesis approach adopted by the STARLIGHT
code allow us to retrieve these histories and after we present
results for the mass assembly of galaxies as a function of
their place in the luminosity hierarchy of the triplets

cal parameter L31 Middle panel The stellar mass of the triplet

One of the spectral synthesis results is the mass vector
initi which gives the fraction of stellar mass in SSPs of
age ti including the mass returned to the ISM Following
Asari et al 2007 we determine the fraction of the current
mass in a galaxy at a certain look-back time t as
ttcid88
t 
initi
This is a cumulative function that grows from 0 to 1 for
t equal to the age of the Universe starting at the oldest
SSP in the spectral base and tracking what fraction of the
stellar mass was due to stars formed up to a given look-back
time We have adopted here a procedure proposed by Asari
et al 2007 where the mass vector initi is resampled in

the bulk of the stellar mass is formed earlier than this look-
back time This gure shows that despite the large scatter
the brightest triplet galaxies tend to form stars more quickly
than the faintest triplet galaxies again consistent with the
expectations of the downsizing eect Cowie et al 1996
Although not shown in this gure intermediate galaxies in
triplets tend to have a stellar mass assembly behaviour in-
termediate between the two cases above
Comparing now the mean mass assembly of galaxies
with the same position in the luminosity hierarchy but in
dierent triplet mass bins we notice that the most massive
triplets harbour galaxies which have formed their stars faster
in the past than galaxies in less massive triplets This eect
is signicant for the brightest galaxy in a triplet but less
conspicuous for the intermediate and faintest galaxies The
stellar mass range for the intermediate mass bin is quite
narrow when compared to the others and can present objects
with similar properties to the low mass bin
53 The age - stellar mass relation
The relation between the mean stellar population age and
the stellar mass of galaxies illustrates how galaxies evolve
Figure 4 shows this relation for galaxies within dierent hi-
erarchical and triplet mass classes
The age - stellar mass relation of galaxies present dier-
ent slopes according to their hierarchical classes The bright-
est galaxies in triplets present a distinct slope in this rela-
tion when compared to the other hierarchical classes These
galaxies are mostly clustered at higher stellar masses and
older stellar population ages producing a low slope relation
when compared to the other classes In addition the bright-
est galaxies from high and low mass triplets mostly occupy
the highest and lowest stellar mass region of this relation
respectively There is again a relation between the proper-
ties of the brightest galaxy and the triplet properties This
result is not noticed for the intermediate and the faintest
galaxies of the triplet In this case the intermediate and the
faintest galaxies are not clustered in any region of the age
- stellar mass plane according to their stellar mass triplet
These results suggest that the evolution of faintest and
intermediate galaxies are quite similar but the brightest
triplet galaxies have evolved in a dierent way
6 EMISSION LINES ANALYSIS
61 The WHAN diagram
The WHAN diagram allows the investigation of the ion-
ization mechanism in galaxies responsible for the emission
lines In the EWH - N ii 6584H plane galaxies
can be classied as star-forming actively forming stars
retiredpassive without or with negligible star formation
and AGN either weak or strong Here we search for corre-
lations of WHAN classes with the luminosity hierarchy and
with the global properties of the triplets
The upper panels of Figure 5 show the WHAN diagram
for triplet galaxies according to their luminosity hierarchical
class and triplet mass bin Some galaxies do not appear in
this gure mostly due to absence of emission lines or for
ccid13 2014 RAS MNRAS 000 112
Figure 3 Mean mass assembly of galaxies classied according
to their triplet mass bin ie low triplet mass a intermedi-
ate triplet mass b and high triplet mass c The brightest and
faintest galaxies in triplets are represented as thick continuous
and dashed lines respectively Lighter lines represent 25 and
75 percentiles of dispersion
time with logt01 dex and then it is smoothed using
a Gaussian lter with standard deviation equal to logt
to avoid discontinuities associated with the discrete set of
ages in the base
This quantity shows how fast a certain galaxy has
formed its stars being dierent for distinct Hubble types
while early-type galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars
a long time ago the stellar mass assembly of star-forming
galaxies is slower Asari et al 2007 have shown that the
star formation history of star-forming galaxies also vary sys-
tematically along the star-forming sequence of the BPT di-
agram ie along the right wing in the O iii 5007H
versus N ii 6584H plane with low-metallicity systems
evolving at a slower pace and with a current large star for-
mation rate than their high-metallicity counterparts as ex-
pected in the downsizing scenario Cowie et al 1996
Figure 3 shows the mean stellar mass assembly of galax-
ies in dierent luminosity hierarchical classes and in dierent
mass bins The thick lines correspond to the mean behaviour
of each class and the light lines represent the 25 and 75
percentiles of the distribution of  for objects of each class
These curves are shown up to logt85 for t in years since

diculties in measuring the lines see Section 4 For this
reason the fraction of passive mostly lineless spectra in
the gure is underestimated From the panels in this gure
it can be noticed that the majority of triplet galaxies are lo-
cated in AGNs passive and retired galaxies loci and only a
few triplets present galaxies classied as star-forming This
result is valid for galaxies classied as the brightest inter-
mediate and the faintest in the triplets The distributions of
the galaxies in this diagram regardless of the triplet mass
bin are dierent according to their hierarchical class in the
triplet
We have evaluated the fraction of the galaxies in each
WHAN class considering also triplet masses and galaxy lu-
minosity hierarchical classes as shown in the lower panels of
Figure 5 In general we can notice an increase in the frac-
tions from star-forming galaxies to AGN and to passive and
retired galaxies The large fraction of passive and retired
galaxies is clear for all hierarchical classes and triplet mass
bins The fraction of star-forming galaxies is the lowest be-
ing at most 20 for low mass triplets Part of this result
may be due to a selection eect As a consequence of the
volume-limited galaxy sample low stellar mass galaxies are
left out from the analysis what can aect these fractions
In the triplet low mass bin there is a systematically
higher fraction of star-forming galaxies compared to the high
mass bin Star-forming galaxies are not found among the
brightest galaxies in massive triplets and are not frequent
also among intermediate mass triplets Comparing the frac-
tions in the highest and lowest mass bins the main trends
are similar fractions of strong and weak AGNs higher frac-
tion of star-forming galaxies in low mass triplets and higher
fraction of retired and passive galaxies in high mass triplets
This result is more prominent comparing the fractions for
brightest and faintest galaxies
These results suggest that the environment in the low
mass galaxy systems is not as ecient to halt star formation
as it is in massive systems They also show the importance
of the triplet mass on the evolution of the stellar populations
of the galaxies in the system for all luminosity hierarchical
classes
62 The mass assembly of WHAN classes
Now we discuss the stellar mass assembly of galaxies in the
several WHAN classes Figure 6 shows the mass assembly
history curves for galaxies in dierent luminosity hierarchi-
cal classes and classied according to the WHAN diagram
The 25 and 75 percentiles of the mass assembly history
are omitted for the sake of clarity in this gure
The mean mass assembly history of galaxies classied
as star-forming are basically the same in all mass bins and
hierarchical classes The same behaviour can be noticed for
weak and strong AGNs
Galaxies classied as passive and retired however
present distinct assembly histories for dierent luminosity
hierarchical classes mainly when we compare the brightest
and faintest galaxies Passive or retired galaxies in the most
massive triplets have formed the majority of their stars in
epochs earlier than the brightest ones in less massive triplets
Since the most of brightest galaxies are classied as passive
and retired then a similar behavior for the mass assembly
history is expected for this WHAN class as shown in Fig-
Figure 8 Fraction of galaxies classied in the WHAN diagram

errors The number of galaxies in each class is also shown
ure 3 Again the mass assembly history of massive galaxies
depends on the triplet mass this trend however is not ob-
served in the other mass bins nor for the intermediate and
faintest triplet galaxies
63 The combination of WHAN classes according
to triplet properties
Here we investigate the combinations of galaxies in each
triplet according to their WHAN classes A census of all
combinations of star-forming 1 strong  weak AGNs 2
and passive and retired galaxies 3 can reveal how WHAN
classes are distributed in dierent triplet stellar mass bins
For instance a combination of three star-forming galaxies is
expressed as 111 whereas in the same notation two galax-
ies classied as AGNs and one as passive or retired is named
Figure 7 shows the fraction of galaxy combinations ac-
cording to WHAN classes for each mass bin Only three
triplets contain the majority of star-forming galaxies clas-
sied as 111 112 and 113 mostly in the low mass bin This
result is in agreement with Duplancic et al 2013 who
found that blue triplets are located in the less massive tail
of the total stellar mass distribution and present an ecient
star formation activity when compared to compact groups
in the same stellar mass bin As the fractions of AGNs and
passive galaxies increases the number of triplets with a dom-
inance of passive and retired galaxies mainly 233 and 333
increases This is an indication that within the framework
of the WHAN classication and for the mass interval consid-
ered here the bulk of the triplets are dominated by passive
and retired galaxies and in a smaller fraction AGNs The
fractions of triplets dominated by passive or retired galaxies
133 233 and 333 are 55 77 and 81 in the lowest
intermediate and highest mass bins respectively

64 Comparison with BPT diagram
We can also make use of other diagnostic diagrams to clas-
sify galaxies according to their emission lines The BPT di-
agram Baldwin Phillips  Terlevich 1981 is traditionally
employed to evaluate the photoionization source of galaxies
Therefore it is useful to compare our WHAN-based classes
with the BPT diagram classication
While the WHAN diagram requires two emission lines
H and N ii 6584 to classify a galaxy the BPT diagram
ccid13 2014 RAS MNRAS 000 112
needs two more namely H and O iii 5007 This diagram
basically classies galaxies into three classes star-forming
composite and AGNs The composite class is an intermedi-
ate class containing star-forming and AGN contributions
and dened here as the region between two curves theo-
retically and empirically dened by Kewley et al 2001
and Kaumann et al 2003 respectively Obviously some
galaxies can be classied in the WHAN diagram but not
in BPT due to the signal-to-noise and bad pixels fraction

restrictions see Section 4 We found 94 galaxies with clas-
sication in both BPT and WHAN diagrams
The comparison between the classications of these 94
galaxies in both diagrams is shown in Figure 8 Roughly
60 of the star-forming galaxies in the WHAN diagram are
in agreement with the BPT classication the fractions be-
ing smaller for composite and AGNs classes The objects
classied as weak and strong AGNs in the WHAN diagram
are mostly classied as star-forming and composite objects
in the BPT diagram and only 30 of the galaxies are
classied as AGNs Passive and retired galaxies interest-
ingly present more than 80 of galaxies classied as AGNs
in the BPT diagram This noticeable divergence between
the two classication schemes is explained by the fact that
the BPT diagram cannot distinguish galaxies with strong or
weak emission lines since it only uses emission line ratios
Stasinska et al 2015 discussed in details this issue Passive
and retired galaxies which present small equivalent width of
H in the WHAN diagram are located in the same locus of
AGNs in the BPT diagram Only the WHAN diagram can
evaluate galaxies according to their emission line strengths
and consequently distinguish galaxies classied as retired or
passive from AGNs
7 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have used the algorithm described in OMill
et al 2012 to identify isolated galaxy triplets in a volume-
limited sample Mr  205  5 log h70 from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 10 An initial sample of 97
galaxy systems between 004cid54zcid5401 is compiled The code
STARLIGHT Cid Fernandes et al 2005 was used to pro-
vide information about the stellar population and the mass
assembly history of triplet member galaxies From the uxes
and equivalent widths of emission lines the diagnostic dia-
gram WHAN was used to classify galaxies according to their
ionization mechanism into star-forming strong and weak
AGNs or passive and retired galaxies Due to the identi-
cation of some galaxies classied as Seyferts I in our triplets
and spectroscopic incompleteness our initial galaxy triplet
sample is reduced to 80 objects with stellar population prop-
erties and emission lines measured for all triplet members
Our main conclusions are
 There is an anti-correlation between the triplet stellar
mass and the luminosity hierarchical parameter L31 indi-
cating that the luminosity dominance of the brightest galax-
ies increases with the triplet mass Correlations between the
properties of the brightest galaxy such as age and absolute
magnitude at r-band and the stellar mass of the triplet are
signicant
 The mean mass assembly history of galaxies separated
according to the hierarchy in the triplet brightest interme-
diate and faintest and triplet stellar mass high interme-
diate and low shows that the mass assembly of brightest
galaxies also depends on the triplet mass Brightest galax-
ies in more massive triplets formed the bulk of their stars
earlier than those in low mass triplets This behaviour is
not so clear for the other galaxies those in the intermedi-
ate and faintest position in the luminosity hierarchy of these
systems
 The relation between the mean stellar population age
and the stellar mass of galaxies in triplets presents similar
behaviour for galaxies classied as faintest and intermedi-
ate and a distinct slope for the brightest triplet galaxies
This result suggests that the evolution of the intermediate
and faintest galaxies is similar but the brightest galaxies
present a distinct evolution essentially characterized by a
faster mass assembly
 The WHAN diagram shows that most galaxies in our
sample are classied as AGNs or passive and retired galaxies
The dominance of passive and retired galaxies in almost all
galaxy luminosity classes and triplet mass bins is evident
as shown in Figure 5 Less massive triplets show dierent
fractions for the dierent hierarchical classes The environ-
ment of triplets favours interactions between the galaxies
they contain eg Hernandez-Toledo et al 2011 and we
can expect that these interactions grow with triplet mass
leading to a faster evolution of these structures and in par-
ticular producing most of the stars fastly in the past and
leading nowadays to a population dominated by passive and
retired galaxies In low mass triplets the interaction between
galaxies did not arrive to halt star formation yet leading to
a dierent population class mix
 The mass assembly history of galaxies classied accord-
ing to the WHAN diagram indicates that star-forming galax-
ies present similar formation histories independently of the
triplet stellar mass or galaxy position in the luminosity hier-
archy On the other side passive and retired galaxies had a
fast mass assembly history As most of the brightest galax-
ies are passive and retired this result conrms our previous
ndings considering only the position in the luminosity hi-
erarchy
 The combinations of WHAN classes for triplet member
galaxies in dierent triplet stellar mass bins was also ex-
plored in this work Star-forming galaxies are mainly in low
mass triplets and only a few triplets present the majority
of their members with this classication Most triplets are
dominated by passive and retired galaxies presenting two
or more members in this class The number of systems with
this specic conguration is higher in more massive triplets
 A comparison between the BPT and WHAN classica-
tions highlights some dierences between classes obtained
with these two approaches The BPT diagram is arguable
more ecient than the WHAN diagram for classication of
star-forming galaxies because the use of four emission lines
carries more information than just two among them but it
lacks eciency to distinguish between retired galaxies from
AGNs and is insensitive to passive galaxies
The results presented in this work indicate that the
brightest triplet galaxy is driving the evolution of the sys-
tem as suggested by the strong correlations between proper-
ties as mass assembly and stellar population age with triplet
properties Intermediate and faintest objects have a sec-
ondary role Triplets are dominated by passive and retired
galaxies This fraction is maximum in high mass triplets
Taken as a whole these results are consistent with the envi-
ronment through galaxy interactions playing a major role
in triplet evolution This is consistent with an analysis of
triplets in mock catalogues which indicates that these sys-
tems are dynamically evolved and probably have undergone
merger events Duplancic et al 2015 favouring the for-

APPENDIX A THE INFLUENCE OF THE
SPECTROSCOPIC INCOMPLETENESS ON
TRIPLET IDENTIFICATION
represents
The spectroscopic incompleteness
the main
source of fake triplets in our sample The ber collision eect
and the nite number of bers of the spectrograph have as
a consequence that not all galaxies in a magnitude-limited
photometric sample are spectroscopically observed Strauss
et al 2002 Consequently due to this eect some of the
systems identied from a spectroscopic sample as a galaxy
triplet can actually be quartets or even systems with larger
multiplicity
We employ photometric redshifts to investigate this in-
completeness The SDSS database provides photometric red-
shifts table Photoz  for objects classied as galaxies that
can be used to evaluate more precisely these spectroscopic
candidates to triplet member Photometric redshifts how-
ever contain larger uncertainties and may be biased com-
pared to spectroscopic redshifts In order to investigate this
eect we divided our initial triplet sample of 97 galaxy sys-
tems see Section 3 in three subsamples corresponding to
the percentiles of 3333 and 6666 of the redshift distri-
bution These redshift ranges correspond to 0040cid54z0060
S1 0060cid54z0078 S2 and 0078cid54z0100 S3 respec-
tively In order to quantify any photometric redshift bias in
the subsamples we selected galaxies with spectroscopic red-
shift following three criteria a within 500 kpc of projected
distance in the sky from the triplet centre b inside the ve-
locity range of V 1000 km s1 from the triplet centre
and c brighter than r1777 It is important to mention
that the subsamples include the triplet candidate members
identied by the algorithm described in section 3 This spec-
troscopic sample corresponds to 418 galaxies
Figure A1 shows the distributions of the dierences be-
tween the photometric and spectroscopic redshifts z 
zphot  zspec of galaxies with spectra around triplets The
mean dierence of a given subsample its mean photometric
redshift bias is taken into account to correct the photomet-
ric redshift of the i-th galaxy at the j-th redshift bin as
zphotcorri  zphoti  zj
where zphoti is the photometric redshift of the i-th galaxy
in the SDSS database and zj is the mean bias of the j-
th redshift subsample This redshift bias is around 103 in
all redshift bins a value comparable to the velocity inter-
val used to dene if a galaxy belongs to a triplet or not
showing that this correction is necessary to evaluate triplet
membership
Next triplet member candidates are selected only
adopting objects with photometric redshifts fulllling cri-
terion a above and within z the standard deviation
of the bias between the photometric and spectroscopic red-
shifts from the triplet redshift bin If the corrected photo-
metric redshift of a galaxy candidate is contained in the
redshift range of the triplet and its absolute magnitude at

tometric and spectroscopic redshifts around triplet candidates

dashed line and 0078cid54z0100 dotted line The mean and
standard deviation of the redshift dierences are at the top right
of this gure In parenthesis are the numbers of galaxies with
spectroscopy around triplets in each redshift bin
r-band is brighter than 2055 log h70 it indicates that the
candidate belongs to the triplet ie the triplet candidate
is actually a more complex system and is excluded from
our triplet sample In this candidate member selection the
dispersion between the spectroscopic and photometric red-
shifts is used instead of the mean SDSS photometric redshift
uncertainty Our choice represents more suitable values for
the magnitude range adopted The root mean square error
rmse found by the SDSS group for the SDSSDR8 spec-
troscopic sample is quite similar to the dispersions presented
here being 00182
Our initial sample of 97 triplet candidates is reduced of
14 objects that present one or more additional galaxies in
the z range The numbers of systems excluded are 6 3
and 5 in the redshift bins S1 S2 and S3 respectively The
additional galaxies considered members of the systems have
corrected absolute magnitudes see section 2 in r-band be-
tween -2054 and -2265 In addition we also excluded three
triplets which harbour galaxies visually classied as Seyfert
I see section 3 Thus after the spectroscopic incomplete-
ness analysis and the Seyfert I exclusion our nal triplet
sample comprises 80 systems
