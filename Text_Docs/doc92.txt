ABSTRACT
Galaxies inhabiting a cluster environment experience signicant evolution in their
orbital motions throughout time this is accompanied by changes in the anisotropy
parameter measuring the relative importance of radial and tangential motions for a
given class of objects Along with orbital changes galaxies in clusters are well known to
undergo severe alteration in their hotcold gas content and star formation properties
Understanding the link between the changes in the internal properties of galaxies and
their orbital motion is of crucial importance in the study of galaxy evolution as it
could unveil the primary mechanism responsible for its environmental dependence
Do the changes in the internal properties happen in parallel with those in the orbital
motion Or are the orbital features at the time of infall what determines the fate
of the member galaxies Alternatively are the properties of galaxies at a given time
related to the coeval orbital anisotropy or are they better related to the anisotropy at
infall In order to answer these questions we studied the orbital evolution of dierent
galaxy populations in the semi-analytic models of Guo et al 2011 applied on to the
Millennium Simulation For each class of objects characterised by dierent internal
properties such as age star formation rate and colour we studied the anisotropy
prole at redshift zero and its evolution by tracing the progenitors back in time
We conclude that the orbital properties at infall strongly inuence the subsequent
evolution of the internal features of galaxies and that the overall anisotropy of the
galaxy population tends to increase with time

INTRODUCTION
In the currently favoured scenario for the formation of cos-
mological structure in the Universe dark matter halos form
and merge giving rise to a hierarchy of objects assem-
bling in a bottom-up fashion In this context galaxy for-
mation is pictured to arise from cooling and condensation of
baryons within the potential well associated to these dark-
matter structures White  Rees 1978 Once the galaxy
is formed
its evolution will be driven by i nature
ie the objects intrinsic features essentially stellar mass
and ii nurture external processes related to the envi-
ronment the galaxy inhabits during dierent stages of its
history It is indeed well known that although the struc-
tural properties of galaxies are mainly determined by their
stellar mass Kaumann et al 2003 Tanaka et al 2004

tal dependence cannot be disregarded Hogg et al 2004

evolution is yet to come understanding what mechanisms
play the leading role in shaping galaxy properties is a
topic of ever increasing interest and research activity but
the results are still controversial Among the environmental
processes four broad classes of mechanisms are generally
considered galaxy mergers negligible in massive clusters
but important in small groups which drive morphological
changes and can aect star formation Toomre  Toomre

gas halo associated to a galaxy when this is accreted onto
a larger structure ram-pressure stripping Gunn  Gott
1972 important in massive clusters where the density of
the intra-cluster medium is highest it leads to the progres-
sive stripping of the gaseous component both hot and cold
of the satellite galaxies tidal eects arising from the gravi-
tational interaction with other members and with the cluster
potential itself they cause stripping and heating Richstone
1976 Moore et al 1996 Some of these processes are bet-
ter understood and formalised eg ram-pressure stripping
while others still lack a strict physical description and are
referred to in more generic terms eg strangulation on
top of this the regimes where each of the mechanisms is
activeunimportant are only broadly assessed In galaxy
clusters the densest possible environments the contribu-
tion of mergers can be neglected due to the large veloc-
ity dispersion of the system strangulation occurs rapidly
and devoids the hot-gas reservoir while ram-pressure strip-
ping and tidal interactions proceed as the satellite plunges
into its host The importance of these last two processes
increases with local density gas density for ram-pressure
stripping total matter density for tidal eects but while
in the rst case this results into enhanced stripping the ef-
fect of tidal interactions is believed to be mainly that of
an induced gas consumption following the increase of nu-
clear activity Boselli  Gavazzi 2006 Given the depen-
dence upon gas and matter density and how these are in
turn related to the radial distance from the cluster centre
it is obvious to expect these processes to strongly depend
on the orbital history of the satellites namely how often
these happen to transit the innermost regions with respect
to the outskirts This will depend on the initial orbit of the
galaxy at the time of accretion as well as on its time evo-
lution within the dynamically-active cluster region There
exist observational evidences that HI-decient galaxies in
nearby clusters are early-type spirals on radial orbits while
gas-rich galaxies are characterised by more tangential mo-
tions Dressler 1986 Solanes et al 2001 other works stud-
ied the dierences in the velocity distribution of early-type
and late-type galaxies and found evidences of the latter mov-
ing on slightly more radial orbits especially at large clus-
tercentric radii Mahdavi et al 1999 van der Marel et al

2010 Deriving this information from a sample of observed
cluster members is not an easy task and various techniques
were developed appositely By instance knowing the pro-
jected number density prole and line-of-sight velocity dis-
persion of the selected galaxies one could perform a Jeans
dynamical analysis Binney  Tremaine 1987 to derive the
cluster mass and velocity anisotropy proles quantifying
the relative importance of radial and tangential orbits as
a function of the clustercentric radius This technique re-
lies on the assumption of spherical symmetry collisionless
dynamics and dynamical equilibrium in addition to be-
ing hampered by the so-called mass-anisotropy degener-
acy even if considerable progress has recently been done to
remove it see  Lokas  Mamon 2003 Battaglia et al 2008
Wojtak et al 2009 This limitations along with the dicul-
ties in performing observations in the outskirts of clusters
should induce caution in the interpretation of the results
Yet it would be interesting to know the extent to which the
evolution of galaxies is linked to their specic orbital mo-
tion Is the type of orbit determining the eciency of the
environmental processes in shaping the internal properties
of the object In this case we would expect severely aected
galaxies to move on more markedly radial orbits as these
cross the cluster right down to its innermost regions Or do
the changes in the galaxy properties happen in parallel to
those in the orbital motion In this case we would expect the
orbits of the objects having suered major environmental in-
uences to dierentiate from those of just-accreted satellites
The importance of the numerical approach in the study of
galaxy evolution need not be stressed cosmological sim-
ulations provide a fundamental tool to understanding the
assembly of structures throughout time but the reliability
regarding their treatment of interactions other than grav-
ity is subject of debate see eg Scannapieco et al 2011

tures in the cosmological context and regulate the formation
and evolution of galaxies according to a set of analytical pre-
scriptions encompassing the physics of the baryonic compo-
nent In this work we use one of the most advanced semi-
analytic models developed to date to study the link between
orbital and internal properties of galaxies belonging to mas-
sive clusters in a CDM cosmology We will show how the

2 THE SEMI-ANALYTIC MODELS AND THE
SELECTED SAMPLE
The samples analysed in this work were extracted from the
galaxy catalogue obtained by Guo et al 2011 hereafter
GUO11 after running their galaxy formation models on the
Millennium Simulation hereafter MS Springel et al 2005
The MS shows how dark matter structures form and evolve
in a CDM cosmological scenario characterised by the pa-
rameters tot  1 m  025 b  0045   075 h 
073 8  09 ns  1 The evolution of cosmological struc-
tures is traced by 21603 particles moving in a periodic box
of side 500 Mpch under the mutual gravitational inuence
The results of the simulation were stored at 64 dierent
times starting from redshift 127 down to redshift zero At
each of these times a catalogue of bound structures and
substructures was generated by applying a friend-of-friend
technique Davis et al 1985 and the SUBFIND algorithm
Springel et al 2001 on the particle distribution these cat-
alogues constitute the basis for recovering the merger history

tree of the simulation Semi-analytic models of galaxy for-
mation as those of GUO11 provide a description of the
cosmological evolution of baryonic matter a gas distribu-
tion is associated to each bound structure identied in the
simulation and its evolution in time is regulated by a set of
recipes implemented on to the dark-matter merger tree iden-
tied in the simulation according to the specic histories of
each of the substructures the evolution of the associated
baryonic components will follow its own peculiar path The
physical processes implemented in the recipes of GUO11 in-
clude cooling star formation supernova and AGN feedback
hot-gas stripping metal enrichment and alone they provide
a remarkable match to the abundance and large-scale clus-
tering properties of the observed galaxy population at low
redshift We will comment on the limits of the model in the
discussion of our results we refer the reader to GUO11 for a
thorough description of the implemented physics and of the
strengths and weaknesses of their approach
We have selected the 1000 most massive clusters identied
in the MS at redshift zero these have virial masses1 greater
than 2  1014 M and contain a total of around one mil-
lion galaxies Although all of these galaxies are originally
associated to a specic dark-matter subhalo not all of them
preserve their dark-matter component throughout the sim-
ulation time this means in turns that in these cases the
dynamical evolution can no longer be provided by the under-
lying simulation The fate of these orphan galaxies gener-
ally referred to as type 2s in the galaxy formation model
which have lost their dark-matter component is to eventu-
ally merge with the galaxy at the centre of the cluster they
inhabit within the timescales set out by dynamical friction
During this time the orbit of the orphan galaxy is traced by
the most bound particle present in its dark matter halo be-
fore this vanished modied by a shrinking factor introduced
to mimic the orbital decay caused by dynamical friction
Since the orbits of these galaxies are altered we decided not
to include them in our analysis This leaves us with  2105
galaxies in the mass range 103  MM  1012 where M
indicates stellar mass We have stacked the resulting galaxy
sample by subtracting bulk motions and by normalising po-
sitions and velocities to the virial values To summarise we
are studying the mean behaviour of galaxies residing in the
most massive clusters at redshift zero
From the galaxy catalogue we have access to a wealth of
information regarding the internal properties of the selected
objects those we are primarily interested in are stellardark
matter masses and colour the latter dened as the the dier-
ence between the rest-frame total absolute magnitude in the
SDSS u and i bands We will eventually discuss the impact
on our results of using other quantities such as mean stel-
lar age and specic star formation rate to split our galaxy
sample into distinct populations
1 These are dened as the masses of the spherical regions centred
on the potential minimum of the smooth halo and corresponding
to an overdensity of  typically  200 with respect to either the
critical density crit or to the mean background density m 
mcrit Hereafter when referring to either the virial radius or
the virial mass of an object we assume the overdensity to be
dened with respect to the critical density

3 RESULTS
In this section we will present the results on the velocity
anisotropy for the galaxies in the selected sample This quan-
tity is dened as
  1 
where t and r are the velocity dispersions in the tangential
and radial direction2 respectively The velocity anisotropy
can take values ranging from  to 1 the former case cor-
responds to purely circular motions no dispersion in the ra-
dial direction while in the latter the orbits are completely
stretched along the radial direction no tangential disper-
sion The case   0 is referred to as isotropy and it occurs
when the velocity dispersion is of comparable magnitude in
both radial and tangential directions We will mostly dis-
cuss global values of  describing a full population of ob-
jects without discriminating the spatial distribution of the
members in one case we will also show the radial prole to
underline both the general properties of the anisotropy pa-
rameter and its dependence on the distance form the centre
of the cluster In what follows we split the galaxy popula-
tion into a red and blue sample according to the value of the
ui colour indicator namely whether it is greater or smaller
than a certain threshold this is set to the value at which the
colour distribution of the galaxy sample splits into two well-
dened dierent components At redshift zero this happens
around u  i  25 considering all the galaxies within three
virial radii the resulting red sample consists of  72000
objects against the  130000 of the blue counterpart3
31 Anisotropy at redshift zero
We rst analyse the results at redshift zero and as a func-
tion of the radial distance of the galaxies from the centre
of the stacked cluster The curves in Fig 1 show the be-
haviour of the anisotropy parameter in 20 equally-spaced
radial shells extending from roughly 01 to 3 virial radii
The error bars were calculated by means of a bootstrapping
algorithm and correspond to two standard deviations this
holds for all the uncertainties reported in this paper un-
less explicitly stated otherwise The black curve shows the
result for the full population the importance of radial mo-
tions increases moving from the central regions outwards
and peaks around 15  2 virial radii This behaviour is typi-
cal of systems formed by gravitational collapse van Albada
1982 and it is compatible with other results in the literature

exclusion of type 2s and ii the choice of three virial radii When
restricting the analysis to 15 virial radii and including type 2s

that of the blue ones

zero The black solid curve shows the radial behaviour of the
anisotropy parameter for the full population of galaxies found in
the selected cluster sample the red blue solid curve represents
the result for the subsample of galaxies characterised by an u  i
colour greater smaller than 25 The error bars are evaluated
via a bootstrapping algorithm and correspond to two standard
deviations The horizontal dotted lines mark the global value of
the anisotropy parameter for all the galaxies within three virial
the blue population has a systematically and signicantly
lower anisotropy than the red population at least between
05 and 25 virial radii This is conrmed by the global val-
ues of  marked by the horizontal dotted lines These were
computed out of all the galaxies found at distances less
than three virial radii from the centre with the following
result all  0253  0006  blue  0189  0006  red 
0345  0008 In summary red galaxies in our sample move
on more radially-biased orbits than the blue counterparts
A clear explanation of this eect will progressively arise in
the following sections
32 Anisotropy at high redshift
In what follows we focus our attention on the time evolu-
tion of the anisotropy parameter Having not found signif-
icant changes in the radial behaviour with respect to the
trend shown in Fig 1 we will only refer to global values of
 hereafter We proceeded in two ways we considered all
the member galaxies belonging to the high-redshift progeni-
tors of the selected clusters and in parallel we also analysed
the progenitors of the redshift-zero galaxies only The two
approaches dier in that the rst galaxy sample may con-
tain objects that do not survive until redshift zero whereas
in the second case only satellites that have a redshift-zero
descendant are considered We show the results of the rst
method in Fig 2 where the value of  computed for the
full population of member galaxies regardless of their spatial
position is plotted as a function of redshift The colour code
is the same as for Fig 1 keeping the threshold u  i  25
for the splitting between the red and blue population or ad-
justing it to the variation in the colour distribution of the
high-redshift galaxies introduces no substantial changes in
the results
The two main considerations arising from this analysis are
Figure 2 Global value of the anisotropy parameter as a function
of redshift Considered are all the member galaxies belonging to
the high-redshift progenitors of the redshift-zero cluster sample
these may include objects which do not survive to redshift zero
The black curve shows the result for the full galaxy population at
each redshift whereas the red blue curve refer to the subsample
of objects with u  i colours greater smaller than a threshold
this is set to be the value at which the colour distribution splits
into two well-dened component eg u  i  25 at redshift
zero u  i  235 at z  07 The error bars are evaluated
via a bootstrapping algorithm and correspond to two standard
deviations
i that the global value of the anisotropy parameter does
not signicantly evolve in time and ii that the blue pop-
ulation is characterised by a lower degree of anisotropy at
all redshifts A more interesting result is given by the analy-
sis of the second sample of high-redshift galaxies These are
progenitors of redshift-zero objects that are already mem-
bers of their nal host cluster at the redshift of interest
and that will not leave it anytime afterwards Fig 3 shows
the global anisotropy for this class of galaxies the colour
code refers to the redshift-zero population only and not to
the progenitors the red blue curve corresponds to progen-
itors of galaxies that are red blue at redshift zero The
plot shows with striking clarity that at each redshift the
anisotropy of the progenitors of redshift-zero galaxies is con-
siderably lower than the value for the whole high-redshift
population Fig 2 overplotted in gray this eect seems to
be even stronger for progenitors of galaxies that are blue at
redshift zero These results suggest i that galaxies on more
radial orbits have less chances to survive and are progres-
sively removed from the member population and ii that
a similar selection eect acts on the galaxy colour namely
galaxies on radial orbits have very low chances to remain
blue until redshift zero The second point will become even
clearer when analysing the anisotropy at the time the galax-
ies fall inside their host cluster
33 Anisotropy at infall
We nally study the orbital properties of galaxies at the
time they become members of their cluster by this we mean
the moment the dark-matter halo of a galaxy is not an in-
dependent structure anymore but a substructure identied

Evolution of cluster galaxies
Figure 3 Global value of the anisotropy parameter as a function
of redshift Considered are the progenitors of the galaxies belong-
ing to the redshift-zero cluster sample only progenitors which are
already satellites and will remain satellites down to redshift zero
are taken into consideration The black curve shows the result for
the full population at each redshift whereas the red blue curve
refer to the subsample of objects with redshift-zero descendant
characterised by u  i colours greater smaller than 25 Over-
plotted in gray are the results displayed in Fig 2 The error bars
are evaluated via a bootstrapping algorithm and correspond to
two standard deviations
within a larger halo We want to see how the anisotropy of
the infalling population varies with time Again we split the
analysis into two parts rst we consider the full sample of
galaxies joining the high-redshift progenitors of our original
cluster sample and second we also restrict the study to the
subsample of galaxies with a descendant at redshift zero
The results of the rst approach are displayed in Fig 4
where we plot  against the infall redshift The red blue
curve refers again to galaxies that are red blue at the red-
shift under consideration keeping u i  25 or varying the
u  i colour threshold to adapt to the colour evolution of the
galaxy population at high-redshift introduces non substan-
tial changes in the results A clear trend appears showing
that the infall anisotropy increases going towards lower red-
shifts this is not surprising as mass-accretion is expected
to occur progressively along small laments extending ra-
dially outside massive clusters The second feature which is
apparent in the plot is that most of the infalling population
consists of blue galaxies as shown by the vicinity of the black
and blue curve as well as by the size of the error bars Third
we see that again the anisotropy of blue galaxies is lower
than that of the red galaxies At a rst glance this may re-
sult somewhat unexpected as there is no obvious reason why
such a trend should already be in place before entering the
cluster environment We note though that the mean mass
of the red sample is considerably higher than for the blue
counterpart almost two order of magnitudes for both stel-
lar and dark-matter masses previous works have already
stated that more massive satellites tend to approach the
cluster along more eccentric orbits as they are more likely
to reside in dense radial laments than the least massive
ones Tormen 1997 This eect could explain the behaviour
observed in Fig 4 and also play a role in the interpretation
of Fig 1 an initially higher anisotropy for the red popula-

falling population as a function of infall redshift Considered are
all the galaxies falling inside the progenitors of the redshift-zero
clusters at dierent times these may include objects which do not
survive to redshift zero The black curve shows the result for the
full infalling population at each redshift whereas the red blue

smaller than 25 The error bars are evaluated via a bootstrap-
ping algorithm and correspond to two standard deviations
tion of infalling galaxies may leave an imprint in the nal
prole at redshift zero The impact of this eect is anyway
limited by the small number of these galaxies within the in-
falling population at z  07 out of 19049 infalling galaxies
only 419 are red Clearly these objects may only represent
a contribution to the population of red member galaxies at
low redshifts Fig 5 shows the results for the subsample of
infalling galaxies with a redshift-zero descendant As usual
in black are the result for the full population whereas the
red blue curve refers to the subsample of galaxies that are
progenitors of objects characterised by a red blue colour
at redshift zero Again we see that at each redshift the
anisotropy of these galaxies is systematically lower than the
value for the full infalling population Fig 4 overplotted
in gray This suggests that galaxies present in the clus-
ter at redshift zero tend to originate from the subsample of
objects entering the cluster environment with the least ra-
dially stretched orbit We then split the full population not
according to the colour of the redshift-zero descendant but
on the basis of their colour at the time of infall the orange
cyan curve represent the infall anisotropy of galaxies that
are red blue at the time of infall We clearly see that the
galaxies which are blue at redshift zero are descendant of
the subgroup of infalling blue galaxies with the lowest in-
fall anisotropy It seems therefore that not only does the
initial orbit strongly inuence how long the galaxy is going
to survive in a cluster environment but that it also plays an
important role in determining the evolution of its internal
properties
34 Evolution of anisotropy in time
When visually comparing the results for the infall anisotropy
Fig 4 and 5 to the typical values at redshift zero Fig 1
and rst points of Fig 2 we already guess that  increases

Figure 5 Global value of the anisotropy parameter for the in-

the progenitors of the galaxies belonging to the redshift-zero clus-

the last time in their history are taken into consideration The
black curve shows the result for the full infalling population at
each redshift whereas the red blue curve refer to the subsample
of objects with redshift-zero descendant characterised by u  i
colours greater smaller than 25 Displayed in orange cyan is
the anisotropy of the subgroups of infalling satellites which are
red blue at the time of infall Overplotted in gray are the results
displayed in Fig 4 The error bars are evaluated via a bootstrap-
ping algorithm and correspond to two standard deviations
from the time the galaxies enter the cluster to the end of
the simulation This is shown more quantitatively in Fig 6
Each of the curves represents the results at a specic red-
shift from 07 in red to zero in black the points on each
curve correspond to the anisotropy at this redshift of the
subgroup of galaxies that fell inside the clusters at the red-
shift given in abscissa The rst points of the lines show the
anisotropy of the galaxies which are just infalling and taken
altogether they reproduce the black curve of Fig 4 Overall
there is a strong indication of an increase of  with time
after the galaxies become satellites and orbit within the en-
vironment of a larger halo this seems to occur rapidly within
the rst 2 Gyrs after infall and more gradually afterwards
In order to understand what this increase was due to we
investigated the evolution of individual orbits From a ran-
dom selection of 500 galaxies belonging to the redshift-zero
sample we isolated  100 objects sharing the same in-
fall snapshot and have recovered their full orbital history
Knowing the satellites mass their position velocity and the
virial mass of the hosts at the time of infall we integrated
the orbits forward in time We used the leapfrog method
to solve for the motion of the objects with timesteps of
around 90 Myrs This time resolution corresponds approx-
imately to one fourth of the temporal separation between
the dierent snapshots in the MS reducing the size of the
timestep further does not signicantly change the results
The integration proceeds for a number of steps correspond-
ing to the total time elapsing from infall z  1 to red-
shift zero We adopt two dierent approaches in the integra-
tion in the rst case hereafter case A we keep the mass of
both the host and the satellite constant at the infall value
whereas in the second case hereafter case B we update
both masses according to the values provided in each of the
snapshots4 and by means of a linear interpolation to ac-
count for our ner temporal integration In both cases we
assume the mass of the host to follow a spherical NFW pro-
le Navarro Frenk  White 1996 The concentration pa-
rameters were evaluated from Eq 5 of Neto et al 2007
who obtained the concentration-mass relation for the halos
identied in the MS at redshift zero we do also allow the
concentration parameter to vary with redshift and assume
the dependency found by Duy et al 2008 for simulated
halos in the redshift range 0  2 In both integrations the
satellites are regarded as point masses and no treatment of
dynamical friction is included this should not signicantly
impact the shape of the orbits though van den Bosch et al
1999 Penarrubia  Benson 2005 At each timestep the
mass felt by the orbiting satellites varies according to the
distance from the centre of the host for both case A and
B and to the cosmological accretion taken into account in
case B only Case A hardly ever reproduces an orbit close to
the original whereas case B provides a better description to
the motions occurring in the simulation Even in this case
however a perfect match to the original orbit is not guar-
anteed Our approximation for the distribution of the host
mass on top of the fact that we are neglecting the eect
of interactions with other orbiting galaxies can sometimes
result in evident mismatches5 Fig 7 shows few examples of
original orbits from the MS black curves in the plots on the
left column and the results of our integration for case A and
B overplotted purple and magenta curves respectively as
mentioned in some cases our approximation grasps the orig-
inal dynamics pretty well eg magenta curves in the rst
three rows while in others we are clearly missing something
eg last row The right column shows the time evolution
of the mass felt by the satellite in both case A and B and
explains the dierences in the corresponding orbital evolu-
Notwithstanding the simplicity of our model we can repro-
duce fairly well the evolution of the anisotropy parameter
for the selected galaxies This is shown in Fig 8 where 
is plotted against the snapshot number the latter ranging
from 41 ie z  1 the infall redshift to 63 ie z  0

obtained from the simulation catalogue ie the real tem-
poral evolution of the anisotropy parameter for the selected
galaxy sample In purple magenta are the results from case
A B We have split the integration into ve slots lasting
each around 1 Gyrs at the end of each slot we updated
the position and velocity of the satellites from the real value
obtained from the MS In case A  immediately increases
towards one after the integration is switched on this is due
to most of the galaxies becoming unbound and can be re-
lated to a progressive underestimation of the depth of the
4 The value for the dark-matter mass of the satellite recovered
from the simulation is subject to inaccuracies whose importance
depends on the spatial position of the object see Knebe et al
2011 We have performed the integration updating the mass of
the host only and keeping the mass of the satellite xed at the
infall value the dierences with the results obtained in case B are
negligible

potential well they are moving in Case B instead provides
a remarkable match to the original prole The agreement
is maintained to a reasonably good level also when the in-
tegration is let proceed uninterrupted from infall to redshift
Interestingly we found that this trend does not translate
naively into the corresponding behaviour of the circularity
distribution Knowing position velocity and masses one can
straightforwardly compute the circularity parameter
where L is the angular momentum of the orbit and Lc is
that of the circular orbit characterised by the same orbital
energy E The circularity parameter has nite values only
for bound orbits ie those with E  0 the limit   0 cor-
responds to purely radial orbits whereas   1 to perfectly
circular motions At each timestep of the integration we
computed the circularity parameter for each of the bound
orbits and looked at its evolution with time Fig 9 shows
the temporal evolution of the mean of the circularity dis-
tribution for both integration A and B As in Fig 8 the
results are shown for ve integration slots at the beginning
of which the position and velocity of the satellite is updated
to the simulation value The purple curves corresponding to
case A are at the mean circularity does not evolve with
time The same holds for the magenta curves corresponding
to case B which also show no net evolution other than for
a mild increase in the rst slot The slope is what is sig-
nicant here while the normalisation of the curves and the
dierences among them are not strictly meaningful Indeed
the rst point of each slot is computed out of position and
velocities extracted from the simulation while the potential
is provided by our simplied model this makes the overall
evaluation of the circularities not fully consistent When let-
ting the integration run uninterrupted from infall to redshift
zero the results are again consistent with no net evolution
of the mean circularity of the galaxy population for both in-
tegrations This analysis is performed on the bound subset
of the galaxy orbits while the results shown in Fig 8 are
obtained out of all the galaxies under consideration When
computing the evolution of the anisotropy parameter for the
bound subsample the results for case B are practically iden-
tical most of the orbits are bound in this case for case A
instead the number of bound orbits is too small to derive
signicant prediction for the temporal evolution of  This
little experiment seems to suggest that taking into account
the evolution of the potential well of the host cluster due
to cosmological accretion is enough to reproduce the trend
in the anisotropy parameter as obtained from the MS for
the sample of galaxies under consideration This is possible
notwithstanding the over-simplistic assumptions of a per-
fectly spherically-symmetric smooth distribution and of an
isolated point-mass satellite At the same time we do not
register a corresponding decrease in the mean circularity of
the bound orbits as one would naively expect but rather
an absence of signicant evolution

4 SUMMARY
We have studied the evolution of the anisotropy parame-
ter for galaxies orbiting within the most massive clusters
extracted from the MS we have related the value of this
parameter to the internal properties of the galaxies as pre-
dicted by the semi-analytic models of GUO11 Our ndings
can be summarised as follows
 At redshift zero blue galaxies move on less radial or-
bits than red galaxies do blue  019 vs red  035 see
Fig 1
 At higher redshifts progenitors of redshift-zero objects
move on less radial orbits with respect to the full population
of member galaxies see Fig 3 this is particularly true for
progenitors of galaxies that are blue at redshift zero
 The orbits of infalling galaxies become increasingly ra-
dial going towards redshift zero see Fig 4
 Of all the galaxies entering the cluster at a certain time
those that will survive until redshift zero are the subgroup
characterised by the most tangential orbits at infall see
Fig 5
 Of all the blue galaxies having a redshift-zero descen-
dant either red or blue and entering the cluster at a cer-
tain time those that remain blue until redshift zero are the
subgroup of infalling objects on the most tangential orbits
compare the blue and cyan curves in Fig 5
 The orbit of satellite galaxies become increasingly ra-
dial in time especially just after the infall inside the cluster
environment see Fig 6
 This increase can be reproduced by a simple integration
of the galaxy orbit taking into account the cosmological
growth of the halo mass see Sec 34
These ndings and their statistical signicance strongly
suggest that the orbital features at infall have a major
inuence on the subsequent evolution of the galaxies ie
on their survival time within the cluster and on their turn-
ing from being star-formingblue to passivered objects

the motion of four dierent galaxies around their host The blue
crosses represent the centre of the host and the initial position of
the galaxy while the circle gives the size of the virial region at
the beginning of the integration The black curve corresponds to
the original orbit from the MS and the purple magenta curve
shows the result of the integration in case A B Whenever the
orbit is bound a triangle is overplotted this is not done for the
original orbit as the information on its energy is not available
The timestep is 90 Myrs approximately one fourth of the tem-
poral separation between two MS snapshots  350 Myrs The
right column shows the evolution of the mass felt by the galaxy
as it orbits around the host in both case A purple curve and
case B magenta curve as spherical symmetry is assumed in the
mass distribution of the host this quantity corresponds to the
mass contained within the sphere of radius r  rsat  rhost
Galaxies on more markedly radial orbits will be more easily
disrupted and removed from the cluster members as time
goes by even if they survive until redshift zero these
objects are those most likely to undergo changes in their
internal properties and turn from being star-formingblue
to passivered Galaxies which conversely join their host
with a signicant component of their motion along the
tangential direction tend to be less aected by the cluster
environment to this category belong all the blue galaxies

5 DISCUSSION
In the previous sections we have been drawing conclusions
from a model which albeit being state-of-the-art is well
known to contain some level of simplication in its treat-
ment of galaxy formation and evolution caution is therefore
needed
As discussed in Section 44 of Guo et al 2011 only for
galaxies in the stellar mass range 95  logMM 
11 does the model predict u  i colour distribution in
agreement with observations at lower higher masses the
galaxies tend to be too red blue and the colour distri-
bution strongly deviates from the reference given by the
SDSSDR7 sample These results were obtained when ap-
plying the model to both the MS and the Millennium-II
Simulation Boylan-Kolchin et al 2009 selecting galaxies
with logMM  10 from the former and galaxies with
logMM 6 10 from the latter We have performed
our analysis on the full galaxy population and after ap-
plying a mass-cut leaving objects within the above ranges
95  logMM  11 and 10  logMM  11
only the results remain qualitatively the same
As already mentioned galaxies orphans of their dark-matter
halo or type 2s were not included in the analysis due to
the lack of information on their real dynamics These objects
are an important ingredient in the model as their presence
allows the predicted galaxy luminosity function and radial
number density prole in clusters to match observations
in addition to this they represent a substantial fraction of
the satellite populations they account for half of all clus-
ter members with M  1010M Including these objects
in our sample has the immediate eect of increasing the
median stellar age while lowering the median specic star
formation rate6 briey the sample ages The eect on the
anisotropy parameter corresponds to enhanced radial mo-
tions from   025 for the full redshift-zero population
without type 2s we move to   035 when these are in-
cluded The relative dierences between the blue and red
population are maintained The reason for this substantial
increase in radial anisotropy can be traced back to the ori-
gin of the orphan population itself galaxies on more radial
orbits are more subject to stripping and will lose their dark-
matter component more easily It may well be that a dark
halo is still present in these objects but that it consists of
an insucient number of particles to be regarded as a real
sub-structure by the halo nders in these cases the tra-
jectory of the most bound particle would still preserve the
radial feature of the original satellite orbit
We have split the original sample of galaxies into two dif-
ferent populations characterised by dierent values of the
u  i colour indicator As a threshold we have adopted the
value where the colour distribution separates into two dis-
tinct component for the galaxy sample we selected this
occurs at u  i  25 at redshift zero We have performed
Evolution of cluster galaxies
the same analysis changing this threshold and making more
extreme cuts both at redshift zero and at higher redshifts
the results remain coherent with those shown in the previous
section We have also used other properties besides colour
to identify the two dierent galaxy populations namely spe-
cic star formation rate and mean stellar age Not surpris-
ingly as all these properties are expected to relate to one
another the results have not signicantly changed
We already mentioned that according to our results
the type of orbit a galaxy is moving on when it last
enters the cluster environment has major consequences
on the evolution of the internal properties of the ob-
ject The nding must be related to the mechanisms re-
sponsible for these environment-induced changes aecting
satellite galaxies moving within a cluster potential The
model of GUO11 features a more sophisticated and real-
istic treatment of these eects with respect to earlier at-
tempts indeed as opposed to previous semi-analytic mod-
els Baldry et al 2006 Weinmann et al 2006 Wang et al
2007 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 where the hot gas associ-
ated to a galaxy is immediately and entirely removed as the
objects is accreted on to a larger system in GUO11 the
stripping of gas is performed gradually and modelled to re-
produce the combined eect of tidal and ram-pressure forces
extending and integrating the recipes of Font et al 2008
and Weinmann et al 2010 In addition to this these pro-
cesses are activated only while the satellite resides within
the virial radius of the host this limits the impact of pos-
sible failures in the FOF algorithm to identify physically
independent but spatially close structures The improved
treatment of environmental eects allows GUO11 to repro-
duce with noticeable accuracy the radial distribution of
star-forming cluster galaxies as found in the SDSS data for
a large sample of nearby clusters see their Fig 3 Albeit its
successes the model is still incomplete as it lacks any treat-
ment for the stripping of the cold-gas component an eect
known to be important in the inner regions of rich clus-
ters Gavazzi 1989 Solanes et al 2001 Boselli  Gavazzi
2006 Even though the overall treatment of environmental
processes in the model does not entirely encompass the full
range of mechanisms at work in real clusters we think our
results are not signicantly aected if anything the inclu-
sion of cold-gas stripping and therefore a more aggressive
implementation of gas removal could only strengthen the
dierences found in the galaxy properties as a function of
their initial orbit
These speculations are conrmed by the results we found
when applying a similar analysis to hydrodynamical simu-
lations where the co-evolution of dark and baryonic matter
is followed self-consistently throughout time We have con-
sidered few among the most massive and relaxed clusters
from the Hutt7 sample Dolag et al 2009 a set of high-
resolution zoomed cluster simulation with implemented
cooling star-formation and feedback processes we also used
the results from the cosmological Magneticum Pathnder

the semi-analytic models in terms of radial behaviour and
global values for  More importantly we found that simu-
lated galaxies characterised by either a young stellar popu-
lation low u  i colour index or high specic star formation
rate  1  1011M yr1 present a systematically lower
anisotropy parameter in each of the radial bins
To summarise we are condent that the intrinsic limits of
the semi-analytic model by GUO11 do not aect the con-
clusions drawn in this paper
A nal comment on our choice regarding the cluster sample
we have focussed our analysis on the most massive clus-
ters found in the MS - objects with virial masses greater
than 2  1014 M - but we emphasise that there is no rea-
son to expect the results obtained for this sample to ap-
ply at lower host masses In fact studying the properties
of the dark-matter subhalos identied in the Millennium-
II Simulation Faltenbacher 2010 shows that their global
anisotropy parameter depends both on the host mass and
on the environment the host is sitting in with satellites re-
siding in either massive or isolated clusters moving on more
markedly radial orbits On the other hand Wetzel 2011
examines high-resolution N-body simulation and evaluates
the orbital parameters of satellites at the time of infall de-
ned as the rst time the object crosses the virial radius of
a larger host halo again a clear dependence of the initial
orbit on the host mass is found with galaxies characterised
by increasingly radial motions at higher host halo masses
We therefore do not expect our results to apply to environ-
ments other than those of the most massive structures at
least not on a quantitative level also the dependence of the
internal evolution of the galaxy properties on the initial or-
bit may not be as strong in smaller objects or groups where
ram-pressure stripping is much less ecient a process than
in rich clusters
Besides the results on the link between orbital and inter-
nal properties of galaxies we also showed our ndings on
the temporal evolution of the orbital anisotropy itself We
found that this quantity increases in time especially just
after infall We note that our denition of infall time may
have an inuence in this analysis at least on the magnitude
of the infall anisotropy half of the substructures hosting
galaxies become part of the friend-of-friend halo of the clus-
ter at distances exceeding two virial radii and may therefore
have an extra tangential component in their initial veloc-
ity arising from the pull of the matter distribution at the
outskirts of the host We found that we can reproduce the
increase in anisotropy by integrating the orbits of galaxies
in a spherically-symmetric smooth mass distribution when
the cosmological growth is taken into account When inves-
tigating the evolution of the circularity distribution for the
bound subsample of the integrated orbits we found very lit-
tle evolution This suggests that the relation between the
anisotropy parameter for a population of galaxies and the
distribution of their circularities is less naive than a simple
one-to-one correspondence
We register some tension between our results and exist-
ing observations Analysing two cluster sets at z  0 and
z  06 Biviano  Poggianti 2009 depict a scenario where
radially-infalling galaxies progressively turn from being star-
forming to quiescent while reducing their anisotropy from
positive values down to   0 At redshift zero the re-
sulting anisotropy prole for the star-forming galaxy sam-
ple is consistent with more radially biased orbits than those
characterising the quiescent counterpart This is equivalent
to saying that the orbits evolve in parallel with the inter-
nal properties of the satellites and that the former do not
signicantly impact the latter Our analysis does instead
support the opposite scenario as thoroughly discussed Ear-
lier on Mahdavi et al 1999 and Biviano  Katgert 2004
reported of observational ndings supporting more radial
orbits for late-type galaxies than for early-type ones their
explanation was again in terms of coeval changes in the
orbital and internal properties of the objects Other ob-
servations as mentioned in Sec 1 report of gas-rich late-
type spirals in nearby clusters being found on more tangen-
tial orbits than early-type gas-poor spirals Dressler 1986
Solanes et al 2001 this is better reconciled with our nd-
ings at least those regarding the impact of the satellites or-
bits on their internal evolution We note though that these
works agree in nding early-type galaxies lenticulars and
ellipticals on close to isotropic orbits
Both the observational and the numerical approach come
with specic limitations and it would be interesting to pin-
point the origin of the disagreement We leave this task to
future works
