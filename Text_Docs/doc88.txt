ABSTRACT 
The comparative genomics revolution of the past decade has enabled the discovery of functional 
elements in the human genome via sequence comparison While that is so an important class of 
elements those specific to humans is entirely missed by searching for sequence conservation 
across species Here we present an analysis based on variation data among human genomes that 
utilizes  a  supervised  machine  learning  approach  for  the  identification  of  human  specific 
purifying selection in the genome Using only allele frequency information from the complete 
low  coverage  1000  Genomes  Project  dataset  in  conjunction  with  a  support  vector  machine 
trained  from  known  functional  and  non-functional  portions  of  the  genome  we  are  able  to 
accurately  identify  portions  of  the  genome  constrained  by  purifying  selection  Our  method 
identifies previously known human-specific gains or losses of function and uncovers many novel 
candidates  Candidate  targets  for  gain  and  loss  of  function  along  the  human  lineage  include 
numerous putative regulatory regions of genes essential for normal development of the central 
nervous  system 
including  a  significant  enrichment  of  gain  of  function  events  near 
neurotransmitter  receptor  genes  These  results  are  consistent  with  regulatory  turnover  being  a 
key mechanism in the evolution of human-specific characteristics of brain development Finally 
we  show  that  the  majority  of  the  genome  is  unconstrained  by  natural  selection  currently  in 
agreement  with  what  has  been  estimated  from  phylogenetic  methods  but  in  sharp  contrast  to 
estimates based on transcriptomics or other high-throughput functional methods 
INTRODUCTION 
While computational and experimental approaches have identified the majority of protein-coding 
genes in humans these coding sequences only account for 1 of the genome Determining the 
extent to which the remaining 99 of the genome may be functional remains a major challenge 
for  biology  To  this  end  recent  experimental  advances  have  facilitated  the  identification  of 
regulatory  regions  Johnson  et  al  2007  non-coding  RNAs  Guttman  et  al  2010  histone 
modifications  Barski  et  al  2007  and  accessible  chromatin  Boyle  et  al  2008  Collectively 
these  experiments  suggest  that  a  substantial  number  of  functional  genomic  elements  reside  in 
non-coding regions 
While these experimental approaches represent a promising avenue towards identifying 
non-coding  functional  elements  in  the  genome  many  of  the  putatively  functional  non-coding 
regions  they  identify  may  be  inconsequential  to  the  organism  For  example  the  ENCODE 
project  Dunham  et  al  2012  integrated  data  from  a  variety  of  genome-wide  experiments 
assessing expression transcription factor binding and other biochemical activities and concluded 
that 804 of the human genome is functional However if we define function as biochemical 
activity  with  fitness  consequences  for  the  organism  then  evolutionary  analyses  tell  a  very 
different story Graur et al 2013 Under this definition which we adopt here functional regions 
of  the  genome  will  experience  purifying  or  negative  selection  which  removes  deleterious 
mutations from populations Comparative genomic studies have identified regions of the human 
genome where substitutions occur less often than expected in the absence of selection and have 
concluded that on the order of 5 of the human genome is functional Chinwalla et al 2002 
Siepel  et  al  2005  Lunter  et  al  2006  Birney  et  al  2007  Pollard  et  al  2010far  less  than 
estimated  by  ENCODE  This  disparity  demonstrates  that  knowledge  of  purifying  selection  is 
essential for identifying functional regions of the genome 
One limitation of purely comparative genomic approaches to detect purifying selection is 
that  selective  constraint  may  not  be  detected  if  it  is  present  in  only  a  small  portion  of  the 
phylogenetic tree being examined A particularly interesting class of elements is therefore missed 
by  these techniques elements that have acquired selective constraint only recently in a  single 
species  eg  human-specific  gains-of-function  Conversely  genomic  regions  experiencing  a 
recent  loss  of  selective  constraint  in  only  a  single  lineage  may  be  misidentified  as  conserved 
throughout the phylogeny Identifying these species-specific gain and loss of function events is 
critical  to  illuminating  the  genetic  bases  for  species-specific  biology  Yet  while  comparative 
genomic data may not be able to detect these events population genetic data can be used to infer 
the current action of purifying selection within a single species Within a population purifying 
selection will confine deleterious mutations to relatively rare allele frequencies or eliminate them 
altogether  This  process  will  also  reduce  variation  at  linked  sites  via  background  selection 
Charlesworth et al 1993 Together negative and background selection decrease the number of 
polymorphisms  and  the  average  derived  allele  frequencies  of  polymorphisms  within  and 
surrounding functional elements fig 1 Indeed the marked reduction in diversity seen within 
and  around  coding  regions  in  the  human  genome  is  consistent  with  the  effects  of  background 
selection McVicker et al 2009 Hernandez et al 2011 Lohmueller et al 2011 
Here  we  describe  a  method  exploiting  the  impact  of  negative  selection  on  genetic 
diversity within populations to identify functional regions of the human genome While recent 
studies have been able to leverage population genetic data to identify differences in the amount 
of purifying selection acting on different classes of sites Pierron et al 2012 Ward and Kellis 
2012 Somel et al 2013 we attempt to classify individual genomic regions as constrained or 
unconstrained  by  selection  In  principle  this  could  be  accomplished  by  comparing  observed 
patterns  of  diversity  to  theoretical  expectations  However  these  expectations  depend  on  the 
demographic  history  of  the  populations  examined  as  well  as  the  distribution  of  selection 
coefficients  encountered  by  new  mutations  Given  that  there  is  considerable  uncertainty 
surrounding these selective and demographic parameters Marth et al 2003 Stajich and Hahn 
2005  Eyre-Walker  and  Keightley  2007  Boyko  et  al  2008  and  given  the  extensive 
heterogeneity in recombination rates McVean et al 2004 as well as variation in mutation rate 
and  data  quality  across  the  genome  Green  and  Ewing  2013  here  we  adopt  a  supervised 
machine  learning  approach  to  classificationwhere  genomic  windows  of  known  class  ie 
functional  or  not  are  used  to  algorithmically  learn  a  set  of  criteria  to  predict  the  classes  of 
genomic windows whose class membership is unknown 
In  particular  we  use  a  support  vector  machine  SVM  approach  to  classify  sliding 
windows  of  the  human  genome  as  either  experiencing  purifyingbackground  selection  or  as 
unconstrained based on the density and allele frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
SNPs in the 1000 Genomes dataset Altshuler et al 2012 SVMs are trained by finding the 
hyperplane that optimally separates two classes of data points from a training set where the true 
class of each datum is known Vapnik and Lerner 1963 with each data point represented by a 
vector of multiple measured attributes or features The SVM can then be used to classify data 
points whose classes are not known a priori according to the side of the hyperplane on which 
their feature vectors are located This classification is often performed after implicitly mapping 
feature vectors to a higher-dimensional space where the two classes are easier to separate the 
kernel trick Aizerman et al 1964 Boser et al 1992 allowing for non-linear discrimination 
Modern support vector machines can also learn hyperplanes that do not perfectly separate the 
entire  training  set  Cortes  and  Vapnik  1995a  necessity  when  some  of  the  training  data 
themselves  may  have  been  misclassified  SVMs  have  proven  highly  effective  in  a  variety  of 
biological  applications  Byvatov  and  Schneider  2003  yet  have  only  begun  to  be  applied  to 
evolutionary questions eg Pavlidis et al 2010 Lin et al 2011 Ronen et al 2013 Schrider et 
al 2015 
Because  we  use  genomic  variation  data  shaped  by  demographic  history  to  train  our 
classifier it will be robust to non-equilibrium demographic events provided they typically have a 
similar  effect  on  patterns  of  variation  in  constrained  and  unconstrained  regions  Thus  this 
supervised machine learning approach allows us to sidestep the problem of learning a parameter-
rich model of demography and selection This is a particular strength of our method in that we 
can  use  the  most  comprehensive  dataset  on  genomic  variation  the  1000  Genomes  collection 
without having to fit a model consisting of dozens if not hundreds of parameters Importantly 
using  real  population  genetic  data  to  train  our  classifier  will  expose  it  to  heterogeneity  in 
mutation rate recombination rate and read depth 
Our  resulting  SVM  is  very  effective  on  both  simulated  data  and  human  population 
genetic data Examining regions classified with high confidence we find that the majority of the 
genome  is  unconstrained  Finally  by  contrasting  our  classifications  with  phylogenetic 
conservation  fig  1  we  identify  regions  that  appear  to  have  experienced  human-specific 
changes in selective constraint Such regions are disproportionately found near genes involved in 
development  of  the  central  nervous  system  CNS  and  may  point  to  important  regulatory 
changes affecting the human brain These results underscore the utility of population genetic data 
for revealing function within the human genome 
METHODS 
Single nucleotide polymorphism data 
We  downloaded  single  nucleotide  polymorphism  SNP  genotypes  from  Phase  1  of  The  1000 
Genomes Project Altshuler et al 2012 we ignored SNPs discovered in the exome andor trio 
data but not the low-coverage whole-genome data in order to minimize variation in read depth 
across  the  genome  which  affects  the  probability  of  discovering  a  polymorphism  Ajay  et  al 
2011 This data set contains 1092 low coverage genomes however 28 pairs of individuals in 
this set are close relatives to one another We removed one individual from each of these 28 pairs 
leaving a set of 1064 unrelated individuals These individuals and their populations of origin are 
listed in supplementary table S1 
Genomes gene annotations and other genomic features 
For  the  purposes  of  counting  SNPs  and  monomorphic  sites  in  an  unbiased  manner  creating 
training sets and performing various downstream analyses we downloaded a variety of data from 
version  hg19  of  the  UCSC  Genome  Browser  database  Kent  et  al  2002  Meyer  et  al  2013 
These data included version GRCh37 of the human genome Lander et al 2001 Collins et al 
2004 with bases masked by RepeatMasker httpwwwrepeatmaskerorg appearing in lower 
case  the  UCSC  gene  annotation  Hsu  et  al  2006  human-chimpanzee  and  human-macaque 
pairwise whole-genome alignments generated by BLASTZ Schwartz et al 2003 mappability 
scores for 50 bp reads Derrien et al 2012 regulatory regions from ORegAnno Montgomery et 
al 2006 Griffith et al 2008 transcription factor binding sites from ENCODE Dunham et al 
2012 lincRNAs Trapnell et al 2010 Cabili et al 2011 small noncoding RNAs from miRBase 
Griffiths-Jones  et  al  2006  Lestrade  and  Weber  2006  gene-disease  associations  from  the 
Genetic Association Database Becker et al 2004 disease-associated SNPs from genome-wide 
association  studies  compiled  by  Hindorff  et  al  2009  and  phastCons  elements  Siepel  et  al 
2005 We also used phastCons elements called from an alignment of 29 mammalian genomes 
but ignoring the human state Lindblad-Toh et al 2011 Most of these data were downloaded 
using The UCSC Table Browser Karolchik et al 2004 We also downloaded the GENCODE v7 
annotation including non-coding RNAs Harrow et al 2012 from wwwgencodegenesorg and 
Gene Ontology GO data from wwwgeneontologyorg and used the set of regulatory elements 
inferred to be gained or lost on the human lineage by Cotney et al Cotney et al 2013 
Inferring ancestral states and removing uninformative sites 
Because we sought to use the derived or unfolded site frequency spectrum we attempted to 
determine the ancestral state of each site containing a SNP This was done by parsimony using 
whole  genome  alignments  of  human  and  chimpanzee  Mikkelsen  et  al  2005  and  human  and 
rhesus macaque Gibbs et al 2007 For each SNP we compared the chimpanzee and macaque 
genomes If both genomes exhibited the same nucleotide as one another and as one of the two 
human alleles we inferred that this nucleotide was the ancestral state Otherwise we considered 
the  ancestral  state  to  be  ambiguous  and  ignored  the  SNP  If  only  one  of  the  chimpanzee  or 
macaque genomes had a base call at the site we inferred that this base was the ancestral state if it 
agreed with either human allele and considered the ancestral state to be ambiguous otherwise 
We also considered the ancestral state to be ambiguous if neither chimpanzee nor macaque had a 
base  call  at  the  site  All  SNPs  whose  ancestral  state  could  not  be  inferred  unambiguously 
according to these rules were considered as uninformative While our ancestral state inferences 
may contain errors our machine learning strategy should be robust if such mis-orientation errors 
also appear in our training set 
We aimed to use not only SNP allele frequencies but also the fraction of monomorphic 
sites in a given region in order to classify it as constrained or unconstrained Thus eliminating 
biases  affecting  the  fraction  of  sites  within  a  genomic  region  inferred  to  be  polymorphic  was 
essential  for  our  analysis  Because  we  eliminated  SNPs  with  ambiguous  ancestral  states  we 
therefore eliminated monomorphic sites with ambiguous ancestral states to prevent the failure of 
ancestral  state  reconstruction  from  biasing  the  density  of  polymorphisms  This  was  done  by 
attempting to infer the ancestral state at each site in the genome using rules similar to those used 
for  SNPs  as  described  above  but  with  no  requirement  that  the  sole  human  allele  equal  the 
chimpanzeemacaque alleles Ie we considered sites where chimpanzee and macaque alleles 
were  both  found  but  differed  from  one  another  or  where  neither  were  found  as  having 
ambiguous ancestral states and considered these sites as uninformative 
In  order  to  prevent  biases  related  to  accuracy  of  mapping  short  read  sequences  from 
affecting  our  analysis  we  examined  mappability  scores  calculated  by  Derrien  et  al  2012 
The mappability score for a given site is 1n where n is the number of distinct positions in the 
genome from which a read mapped to this site could be derived allowing two mismatches For 
example a site lying in a sequence motif occurring three times in the genome would have a score 
of 13 while a site in unique sequence would have a score of 1 We examined all adjacent 1 kb 
windows  across  the  human  genome  and  found  a  significant  positive  correlation  with  average 
mappability  score  and  the  number  of  SNPs  called  from  the  1000  Genomes  data  0068 
P2210-16  Windows  in  the  lowest  mappability  score  bin  contained  79  SNPs  on  average 
while  windows  with  a  mappability  score  of  one  averaged  136  SNPs  supplementary  fig  S1 
The  lack  of  SNP  calls  within  regions  of  low  mappability  shows  that  poor  mapping  quality 
prevents  high  confidence  SNP  detectionthis  underscores  the  importance  of  accounting  for 
mappability  when  examining  the  density  of  SNPs  or  other  polymorphisms  We  therefore 
considered only sites with mappability scores of 1 to be informative Similarly sites masked by 
RepeatMasker  were  considered  uninformative  All  uninformative  sites  were  ignored  when 
calculating the site frequency spectrum for a given window as described in the following section 
and therefore had no impact on SVM training or classification  
Estimating a modified site frequency spectrum in genomic windows 
Our goal in this study was to accurately classify genomic windows of a given size as constrained 
or unconstrained by purifying selection The practical utility of this approach depends on the size 
of  the  windows  small  windows  may  be  difficult  to  classify  accurately  as  they  have  fewer 
informative sites while larger windows provide lower resolution To find an appropriate balance 
between accuracy and resolution we attempted to train classifiers using 5 kb 10 kb and 20 kb 
windows windows of these sizes contain 65 130 and 260 SNPs and 2176 4352 and 8703 
informative sites on average in the 1000 Genomes data respectively 
We  represented  each  window  with  the  same  modified  version  of  the  site  frequency 
spectrum SFS used for simulated data set as described in supplementary text S1 0 1 2 
 n-1 where i is the fraction of informative sites in the window having a SNP whose derived 
allele is present in i chromosomes and n is the number of chromosomes in the sample ie twice 
the number of diploid individuals As with the simulated data sites containing a fixed derived 
allele  were  included  in  0  as  our  goal  was  to  use  only  polymorphism  data  to  perform 
classification However we did experiment with including derived fixations during training as 
described below finding that the gains in accuracy were quite modest typically on the order of 
1 or less supplementary table S2 
We estimated the modified SFS for each window only from informative sites as defined 
above As a consequence for some windows the SFS was estimated from only a small number of 
sites  To  prevent  elevated  uncertainty  around  these  SFS  estimates  from  confounding  our 
classifier we arbitrarily removed windows comprised of 25 informative sites We refer to the 
remaining windows as informative windows 
Because SVMs allow for a large number of features we are able to use the complete SFS 
rather than a small number of summary statistics to perform classificationthis is an important 
advantage of our method insofar as condensing the entire SFS into a summary statistic such as 
Tajimas  D  Tajima  1989  might  remove  valuable  information  However  the  full  SFS  in  the 
1000 Genomes data is quite sparse containing 2128 frequency bins but only 130 SNPs per 10 
kb window on average We therefore experimented with grouping the SFS into different numbers 
of  bins  10  25  50  100  250  500  1000  and  2128  no  binning  in  addition  to  the  different 
genomic window sizes listed above We found that classification was most effective with 1000 
bins  and  that  10  kb  windows  yielded  a  good  balance  between  resolution  and  accuracy

Training a support vector machine classifier 
For the purposes of extracting a training set from the human genome we subdivided the genome 
into adjacent windows We then labeled windows as constrained if they were composed of 25 
sites conserved across vertebrates according to phastCons Siepel et al 2005 or unconstrained 
if  they  contained  zero  base  pairs  within  vertebrate  phastCons  elements  GENCODE  v7  exons 
including  non-coding  RNAs  Harrow  et  al  2012  UCSC  exons  Hsu  et  al  2006  ENCODE 
transcription  factor  binding  sites  Dunham  et  al  2012  or  ORegAnno  regulatory  elements 
Montgomery et al 2006 Griffith et al 2008 Though the 25 phastCons cutoff for functional 
training data is arbitrary only 5 of the human genome is conserved across species windows 
that  are  25  conserved  according  to  phastCons  are  thus  very  likely  to  encode  important 
functions Because the amount of observed divergence on the human branch will correlate with 
the amount of observed polymorphism within humans due to ascertainment bias Kern 2009 
when building our training set we used phastCons conserved elements obtained from examining 
only non-human mammals Lindblad-Toh et al 2011 The 25 conserved sequence cutoff was 
adjusted  for  5  kb  and  20  kb  windows  sizes  to  achieve  appropriate  sized  training  sets 
supplementary table S2 To construct an unbiased training set we included the same number of 
conserved and unconserved windows Because for each training set examined below there were 
more  unconserved  than  conserved  windows  windows  meeting  the  unconserved  criteria  were 
randomly selected until a set matching the conserved set in size was obtained ie a balanced 
training  set  For  10  kb  windows  this  training  set  contained  1482  windows  in  total741 
windows met the criterion for inclusion in the functional set and 741 of the 11439 that met the 
nonfunctional criteria were randomly selected for inclusion in the nonfunctional set 
For each combination of bin size and window size we conducted a grid search of the C 
and  hyperparameters and assessed the accuracy of the resulting SVMs in the same manner as 
for our simulated data sets The results of these grid searches are shown in supplementary table 
S2 Prior to training the SVM we used LIBSVMs svm-scale to rescale the training data with 
default parameters saving the scalars for re-use prior to prediction We then used LIBSVMs 
svm-train to learn an SVM from the entire training data set using the optimal number of bins 
1000  for  10  kb  windows  The  -b  1  option  was  used  to  allow  estimation  class  membership 
probabilities  during  prediction  We  used  LIBSVMs  plotrocpy  python  script  to  generate  the 
ROC curve supplementary fig S2 for this SVM using 10-fold cross validation We also used 
plotrocpy to generate the ROC curve on a balanced independent test set and calculate the area 
under the curve For this test set windows with between 20 and 25 percent phastCons elements 
were labeled as functional while only windows with no phastCons conservation were labeled as 
nonfunctional 
Predictions and element calls 
After  training  the  SVM  we  formatted  all  overlapping  10  kb  windows  100  bp  step  size  for 
classification and rescaled these windows using the same scalars used for the training set We 
then used svm-pred to perform classification using the -b 1 option to perform class probability 
estimates for each window Next we then combined all overlapping windows assigned to a given 
class with probability 095 LIBSVM calculates these probability estimates using Algorithm 2 
from  Wu  et  al  2004  We  refer  to  these  regions  as  popCons  elements  when  made  up  of 
windows  classified  as  constrained  and  as  popUncons  elements  when  made  up  of  windows 
classified  as  unconstrained  We  imposed  this  95  probability  cutoff  in  order  to  focus  on 
windows  classified  with  high-confidence  Finally  we  removed  elements  having  20  of 
informative  sites  masked  by  the  1000  Genomes  Project  for  having  elevated  or  reduced  read-
depth  or  low  mapping  quality  in  order  to  limit  the  effect  of  these  sources  of  error  on  our 
predictions This was done using the strictMask files which impose stringent filters devised for 
population genetic analysis available at httpwww1000genomesorg Note that because we 
performed  classification  on  overlapping  windows  it  was  possible  for  popCons  elements  and 
popUncons elements to overlap 
Searching for evidence of human-specific gain and loss of function 
In order to find genomic regions experiencing gain or loss of selective pressure in humans only 
we  contrasted  phylogenetic  evidence  for  selective  constraint  from  phastCons  with  population 
genetic  evidence  from  popCons  and  popUncons  elements  To  find  human-specific  losses  of 
function  we  examined  popUncons  elements  made  up  of  at  least  15  vertebrate  phastCons 
elements  and  cross-referenced  this  list  with  UCSC  genes  Hsu  et  al  2006  to  search  for 
compelling candidates For human-specific gains of selective constraint we examined popCons 
elements  composed  of  1  vertebrate  phastCons  elements  cross-referencing  this  list  with 
UCSC  genes  and  ORegAnno  elements  to  find  candidate  regions  For  this  analysis  we  only 
included elements with informative windows on which classification was performed within at 
most 100 kb of the element in each direction Thus the element must be flanked by regions that 
contain  enough  informative  sites  to  be  classified  but  do  not  exhibit  a  strong  enough  signal  of 
selective constraint to be classified as popCons elements This step is necessary to ensure that the 
target of purifying selection resides within the gain of function candidate element itself rather 
than  some  flanking  functional  element  lacking  enough  informative  sites  to  be  classified 
Candidate gain of function regions singled out in the text were also examined manually via the 
UCSC Genome Browser Kent et al 2002 to ensure that no flanking but unclassified element 
appeared  to  be  the  true  target  of  selection  Patterns  of  phylogenetic  conservation  among 
primates mammals and vertebrates were examined using the phastCons Siepel et al 2005 and 
GERP Davydov et al 2010 tracks in the UCSC Genome Browser 
Testing for enrichment of element calls with various genomic features 
To ask whether popCons elements overlapped more often than expected by chance with exons 
and other features listed in supplementary table S3 we first counted the number of base pairs 
lying within both a popCons element and within one of the features being tested for enrichment 
Next we permuted the popCons coordinates such that no two elements in the permuted data set 
overlapped  just  as  in  the  true  set  For  our  popCons  permutations  we  ensured  that  every 
permuted element consisted entirely of windows that were classified one way or another by our 
SVM  ie  informative  windows  this  step  ensures  that  any  systematic  differences  between 
informative and uninformative regions eg repeat content or read mappability will not produce 
spurious enrichmentdepletion results We were unable to meet this constraint when permuting 
popUncons  elements  as  our  permutation  algorithm  of  randomly  placing  the  largest  remaining 
element in an unoccupied portion of the genome and repeating would run out of available room 
to  randomly  place  elements  before  terminating  Fortunately  this  limitation  likely  makes  our 
depletion  results  conservative  as  our  informative  windows  are  enriched  for  many  of  the 
functional annotation categories listed in supplementary tables S3 and S4 For both popCons and 
popUncons  permutations  we  also  ensured  that  no  permuted  elements  had  fewer  than  80  of 
base pairs passing the 1000 Genomes Projects coverage and quality cutoffs in the same manner 
as described above for our filtering of popCons and popUncons elements 
We constructed 1000 such permuted data sets and then compared each of these permuted 
sets with each of the data sets listed in supplementary table S3 For each comparison we counted 
the total number of base pairs lying within both sets The P-value for each enrichment test was 
simply the number of permuted data sets exhibiting equal or greater overlap with the genomic 
feature being examined than the real popCons data set For popUncons elements we performed a 
similar test but counted permuted data sets exhibiting lesser or equal overlap to obtain a P-value 
for depletion 
We performed similar tests for gain and loss of function GOF and LOF respectively 
candidate regions and sets of genomic features listed in supplementary table S4 These sets were 
obtained  by  applying  the  phastCons  cutoffs  we  used  to  define  GOF  and  LOF  regions  to  our 
permuted sets Specifically each permuted GOF set was constructed by removing all elements 
from  the  corresponding  permuted  popCons  set  except  those  with  1  phastCons  bases 
Similarly  each  permuted  LOF  set  was  constructed  by  removing  all  elements  from  the 
corresponding permuted popUncons set but those with 15 phastCons bases In each case the 
permuted  set  yielded  more  regions  than  the  true  candidate  set  so  we  randomly  sampled 
permuted  sets  of  the  correct  size  Before  testing  our  GOF  candidates  for  enrichment  of  the 
genomic features in supplementary table S4 we removed from these sets of features all elements 
comprised of 1 phastCons bases Similarly we removed all genomic features comprised of 
15 phastCons bases before testing for LOF candidates for enrichment  
We also used version 202 of GREAT McLean et al 2010 to ask whether GOF and 
LOF elements were preferentially located near genes of particular functional categories relative 
to the set of all popCons or popUncons elements respectively We then repeated these tests on 
our permuted data asking how often terms significantly enriched in our true data were enriched 
in the permuted data sets 
Synonymous and nonsynonymous variation within popCons and popUnCons elements 
For  orthogonal  evidence  that  popCons  and  popUncons  elements  were  correctly  classified  as 
conserved or unconserved respectively we examined coding SNPs within genes found in these 
regions We counted the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous SNPs in each gene using 
the GENCODE annotation Singleton SNPs were omitted from this analysis to limit the influence 
of sequencinggenotyping error 
Recombination rates in popCons elements popUncons elements and training data 
We  downloaded  sex-averaged  recombination  rates  calculated  by  Kong  et  al  2010  from  the

recombination rates within 10 kilobase windows These rates are adjusted so that a rate value of 
1 is the genome-wide average We calculated the average rate for each element as the sum of the 
rates  of  each  10  kb  window  overlapping  the  element  with  each  the  rate  of  each  window

Human-specific substitutions from a four-way ape whole-genome alignment 
To locate human-specific substitutions and indels we first obtained an alignment consisting of 
human hg19 chimpanzee panTro2 gorilla gorGor1 and orangutan ponAbe2 To do this 
obtained 
the  multiz46way 
alignment 
the  UCSC 
genome

httpgenomeucscedu  and  then  extracted  only  these  four  sequences  Using  this  four-way 
alignment we then located human-specific changes using parsimony criteria requiring invariance 
in the other three great apes To obtain counts of substitutions or indels per window of a given 
size  throughout  the  genome  we  used  the  featureBits  tool  from  the  Kent  source  tree  available 
from the UCSC Genome Browser group

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Detecting negative selection in simulated data 
We  assessed  the  effectiveness  of  our  SVM-based  approach  to  detect  selective  constraint  by 
performing forward simulations of functional 10 kb windows containing constrained elements of 
various sizes and experiencing varying strengths of negative selection as well as nonfunctional 
10  kb  windows  evolving  entirely  under  drift  Each  simulation  utilized  one  of  three  different 
mutation  and  recombination  rates  supplementary  text  S1  These  simulations  were  performed 
under  the  demographic  model  learned  from  Tennessen  et  al  2012  as  described  in  the 
supplementary text S1 This scenario models the divergence of Europeans and Africans and their 
subsequent population size dynamics This demographic model is not meant to perfectly match 
the demographic history of our dataset which contains samples from a variety of subpopulations 
across the globe Rather it was chosen simply because it models some events common to many 
human  subpopulations  eg  migration  out  of  Africa  and  recent  exponential  population  size 
expansion For the purposes of training and testing our SVMs we represented the output from 
each  simulation  by  a  feature  vector  consisting  of  the  windows  site  frequency  spectrum 
supplementary text S1 
After training we assessed the accuracy of each SVM using an independent test set this 
estimate  typically  closely  matched  that  obtained  from  cross-validation  during  the  grid  search 
16 lower on average supplementary table S5 showing that our grid search does not lead to 
substantial  overfitting  This  important  result  implies  that  our  cross-validation  accuracies 
estimated  from  real  data  see  below  are  probably  reliable  indicators  of  our  methods 
effectiveness  even  though  the  demographic  and  selective  history  of  the  1000  Genomes 
population sample differs from that of our simulated populations Moreover we found that after 
imposing a 95 posterior probability cutoff as we did when calling putative constrained and 
unconstrained  elements  from  the  1000  Genomes  data  as  discussed  below  classification 
accuracy typically well-exceeded 95 supplementary table S5 
Next we assessed the effectiveness of a single SVM classifier on test sets with varying 
selection coefficients selected element lengths mutation rates and recombination rates For this 
analysis we used the classifier learned from regions evolving under drift from those with 75 of 
sites under selection with a selection coefficient of 2Ns of 100 and with variable mutation and 
recombination rates we chose to test the classifier learned from these data because this SVMs 
cross-validation accuracy closely mirrored that of the SVM we learned from real genomic data 
see below Perhaps unsurprisingly we found that accuracy with which we could discriminate 
between simulated functional and nonfunctional windows varied according to the fraction of the 
10 kb window experiencing selective constraint When a 25 kb subset of the region was under 
negative  selection  accuracy  was  quite  low  ranging  from  50-60  and  varying  only  slightly 
according to the strength of selection supplementary fig S3A When the entire window was 
constrained  accuracy  was  much  higher  supplementary  fig  S3A  typically  90  or  greater 
supplementary table S6 with the one exception being cases where the mutation rate was low
in these cases unselected regions were often misclassified as selected However for these and 
other  parameter  combinations  the  number  of  unselected  regions  misclassified  as  constrained 
decreases dramatically after imposing a 95 confidence cutoff supplementary fig S3B On the 
other hand we find that regions with a smaller number of selected sites may often be classified 
as  unconstrained  even  after  imposing  this  cutoff  supplementary  fig  S3C  Thus  it  may  be 
difficult using our approach to confidently assert that a genomic window contains no functional 
sequencea window experiencing selection at relatively few selected sites will be difficult to 
distinguish from an unconstrained window 
Because  our  SVM  classifies  every  genomic  window  as  either  evolving  under  selective 
constraint  or  under  drift  we  reasoned  that  regions  experiencing  positive  selection  might  be 
classified as constrained as positive selection reduces diversity at linked sites Maynard Smith 
and  Haigh  1974 We  thus  simulated  regions  experiencing  adaptive  mutations  supplementary 
text S1 and asked how often each SVM described above classified such regions as experiencing 
selective constraint The fraction of positively selected regions classified as constrained exhibited 
considerable variation across SVMs governed in part by the extent to which diversity within the 
negatively  selected  regions  used  to  train  the  SVM  mirrored  that  within  positively  selected 
simulations  the  absolute  difference  in  average    in  the  positively  and  negatively  selected 
simulations was negatively correlated with the fraction of positively selected regions classified as 
constrained Spearmans -087 P2210-16 Thus it appears that depending on the strength 
and amount of negative selection acting on putatively functional windows used to train our SVM 
and the strength of recent selective sweeps occurring in the human genome positively selected 
regions may often be classified as constrained 
In  summary  extensive  forward  population  genetic  simulations  show  that  our  SVM 
approach is able to detect negative selection even in the face of the confounding effects of non-
equilibrium demography While we have greater ability to classify as functional those windows 
that are comprised more completely of selected sites and sites under stronger selection we have 
very high specificity when detecting functional windows after imposing a strict 95 posterior 
probability  cutoff  though  we  may  classify  windows  with  smaller  numbers  of  functional  base 
pairs as unconstrained With these encouraging results in hand we turn attention to empirical 
human data 
Accurate classification of functional and nonfunctional windows 
We trained an SVM to classify 10 kb genomic windows as either constrained or unconstrained 
according to the same modified SFS used to classify simulated data Methods using LIBSVM 
Chang  and  Lin  2011  For  this  we  used  data  from  1064  unrelated  whole  genome  sequences 
included in Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project httpwww1000genomesorg Altshuler et al 
2012 Methods This data set contains one SNP every 769 bp on averagewe hypothesized 
that this high density of polymorphism would allow for the detection of regions under purifying 
selection  at  high  enough  resolution  to  be  of  practical  utility  We  then  trained  our  SVM  as 
described in the Methods Because cross validation accuracies achieved on the X were relatively 
low  perhaps  due  to  limited  training  data  supplementary  table  S2  we  only  performed 
classification on the autosomal portion of the genome 
The optimal hyperparameter combination C2 0125 from the autosomal grid search 
resulted  in  a  cross-validation  accuracy  of  8779  supplementary  table  S2  area  under  ROC 
curve094  supplementary  fig  S2  The  full  results  of  this  grid  search  are  shown  in 
supplementary  fig  S4  That  many  of  the  other  parameter  values  neighboring  the  optimal 
combination were nearly as accurate suggests that we did not significantly overfit our training 
data Moreover we achieve high accuracy on an independent test set not used in the selection of 
hyperparameter  values  or  training  area  under  curve088  Further  simulation  results  see 
above demonstrate that cross-validation accuracy for our SVM is reflective of true accuracies 
under  a  broad  range  of  models  suggesting  that  we  are  not  dramatically  overestimating  our 
accuracy due to overfitting Moreover these high accuracies show that although levels of genetic 
diversity  are  impacted  by  forces  other  than  natural  selection  such  as  drift  and  variation  in 
mutation and recombination rates supporting the notion that population genetic data can be used 
to distinguish constrained from unconstrained DNA Schrider and Kern 2014 
We then used the optimal hyperparameters to train an SVM from the entire training set 
this SVM was in turn used to classify every 10 kb window with 100 bp step size in the genome 
comprised  of  at  least  25  informative  sites  as  either  constrained  or  unconstrained  Of 
22358126  such  genomic  windows  covering  a  total  of  865  of  the  genome  the  majority 
16836483 or 753 of windows were classified as unconstrained in general agreement with 
comparative genomic studies Shabalina et al 2001 Chinwalla et al 2002 Siepel et al 2005 
Lunter et al 2006 Birney et al 2007 Pollard et al 2010 LIBSVM can be used to estimate 
posterior probabilities for classifications according to the distances between the classified feature 
vector and the discriminating hyperplane during cross-validation In order to focus on windows 
classified with high-confidence we imposed a 95 probability cutoff for windows assigned as 
constrained or unconstrained a cutoff that we show to be quite conservative in our simulation 
study  see  above  Overlapping  windows  classified  as  constrained  with  high-confidence  were 
merged together into regions we refer to as popCons elements and overlapping high-confidence 
unconstrained windows were merged into popUncons elements 
Because we trained our SVM to discriminate between regions with a fairly large fraction 
of conserved sites according to phastCons 25 and regions with zero conservation according 
to phastCons regions with lower levels of conservation may not be properly classified Indeed 
this appears to often be the case in simulated data as discussed above We therefore sought to 
directly  assess  our  methods  accuracy  on  regions  with  fewer  functional  sites  by  constructing 
several test sets with different amounts of selective constraint We found windows with between 
0 and 5 conserved sites according to phastCons are classified as popUncons elements by our 
classifier 332 of the time while 164 of windows with 5-10 conservation are classified as 
popUncons elements versus 89 of windows with 10-15 conservation and 53 of windows 
with 15-20 conservation Table 1 These results imply that many of our popUncons elements 
may have a relatively small number of selected sites While we do not have power to classify 10 
kb windows as completely unconstrained by negative selection the results from Table 1 imply 
that our popCons elements probably contain a substantially greater density of selected sites than 
popUncons on average 
Crucially  we  sought  to  minimize  the  impact  of  variation  in  read  depth  and  mapping 
quality  on  our  predictions  We  therefore  only  retained  elements  for  which  80  of  all 
informative sites met the strict read depth and mapping quality constraints imposed by the 1000 
Genomes  Consortium  Altshuler  et  al  2012  for  population  genetic  analyses  using  these  data 
Methods  these  criteria  enforce  both  strict  minimum  and  maximum  read  depth  as  well  as 
minimum mapping quality thresholds This step may not be sufficient to completely eliminate 
the impact of variation in read depth on our predictions Green and Ewing 2013 Such variation 
may thus contribute to the error rates that we have measured on our empirical test data sets 
We  examined  the  amount  and  spectrum  of  genetic  variation  found  in  popCons  and 
popUncons  elements  Consistent  with  purifying  and  background  selection  acting  on  popCons 
elements  popCons  elements  exhibit  a  much  greater  skew  in  the  SFS  toward  lower  frequency 
variants  than  do  popUncons  elements  fig  2A  as  well  as  much  lower  nucleotide  diversity  in 
40210-4 in popCons elements and 11210-3 in popUncons elements fig 2B Thus our 
classifier is segmenting the genome based on the amount and spectrum of genetic diversity as 
expected 
PopCons elements are enriched for features indicative of functionality 
To  test  if  our  predictions  recover  previously  known  functional  elements  we  asked  whether 
popCons  elements  were  enriched  for  various  genomic  features  that  may  experience  selective 
constraint  including  coding  sequences  phylogenetically  conserved  regions  of  the  genome 
phastCons  elements  regulatory  elements  gained  or  lost  on  the  human  lineage  transcription 
factor  binding  sites  and  other  oRegAnno  regulatory  elements  small  noncoding  RNAs 
lincRNAs disease-associated genes and candidate SNPs from GWAS studies Methods The 
results  of  these  enrichment  tests  are  shown  in  supplementary  table  S3  After  Bonferroni 
correction PopCons elements were significantly enriched for and popUncons elements depleted 
of  all  of  these  features  except  of  lincRNAs  GWAS  SNPs  and  regulatory  elements  lost  in 
humans These results show that our classifier correctly identifies constrained and unconstrained 
genomic  regions  as  expected  from  current  annotations  providing  further  evidence  that  our 
approach  is  not  severely  confounded  by  nonselective  factors  that  impact  genetic  diversity 
Moreover these results confirm that our predictions have practical utility despite their relatively 
coarse resolution in comparison to phylogenetic methods such as GERP Davydov et al 2010 
and phastCons Siepel et al 2005 
As  stated  above  many  more  genomic  windows  were  classified  as  unconstrained  than 
constrained  When  using  only  high-confidence  windows  more  than  half  of  the  genome  lies 
within  popUncons  elements  50378  elements  538  of  the  autosomes  far  more  than  in 
popCons  elements  17551  elements  111  of  the  autosomes  popUncons  elements  are  also 
much larger than popCons elements on average 286952 bp versus 169994 bp P2210-16 
Mann-Whitney U-test fig 2C At face value this result seems to strongly reject the possibility 
that 80 of the human genome is functional Dunham et al 2012 However our classifier does 
not have enough resolution to predict precisely which base pairs are functional and which are 
notpopUncons  elements  may  be  experiencing  purifying  selection  weak  enough  to  go 
undetected and popCons elements probably contain many base pairs not directly under purifying 
selection but instead linked to sites undergoing negative selection or recent positive selection 
see simulation results Nonetheless our results suggest that only a small fraction of the genome 
is experiencing strong purifying selection again in general agreement with comparative genomic 
analyses  Shabalina  et  al  2001  Chinwalla  et  al  2002  Siepel  et  al  2005  Lunter  et  al  2006 
Birney et al 2007 Pollard et al 2010 Gulko et al 2015  
Identifying human-specific loss of function 
Comparative  genomic  studies  have  identified  many  genes  lost  in  humans  but  present  in  other 
primates  Wang  et  al  2006  these  loss  events  are  typically  caused  by  a  missense  or  other 
inactivating mutation and leave behind a pseudogene remnant Schrider et al 2009 It has been 
hypothesized  that  these  loss  of  function  LOF  events  often  confer  fitness  advantages  Olson 
1999  and  there  are  several  examples  of  putative  adaptive  losses  occurring  since  the  human-
chimpanzee split eg Hayakawa et al 2006 Wang et al 2006 Xue et al 2006 
Using evidence of phylogenetic conservation in conjunction with our population genetic 
based predictions of conservation should allow for discovery of LOF events in the genome That 
is LOF events should have strong signatures of phylogenetic conservation but also reside within 
popUncons  elements  Indeed  our  classifier  was  able  to  recover  several  previously  identified 
cases  of  putatively  adaptive  pseudogenization  events  For  example  MYH16  which  encodes  a 
protein that is found in the temporalis and masseter muscles and increases bite strength has been 
inactivated in the human lineage Stedman et al 2004 It has been hypothesized that the loss of 
this  protein  has  allowed  for  cranial  expansion  in  humans  Stedman  et  al  2004  This  gene 
exhibits strong phylogenetic evidence for conservation within primates according to phastCons 
but  is  largely  contained  within  a  popUncons  element  consistent  with  human-specific  loss  of 
selective  constraint  Additional  human-specific  losses  of  CASP12  Fischer  et  al  2002  and 
CMAH Chou et al 1998 Irie et al 1998 both of which appear to have been fixed by positive 
selection Hayakawa et al 2006 Wang et al 2006 Xue et al 2006 occur in regions conserved 
across species according to phastCons but are contained entirely in popUncons elements 
Perhaps 
the  most  striking  pattern 
to  emerge  from  studies  of  human-specific 
pseudogenization events is the large number of nonfunctional olfactory receptors ORs in the 
human  genome  Rouquier  et  al  1998  ORs  appear  to  have  experienced  diminished  selective 
constraint  in  primates  Rouquier  et  al  1998  Young  et  al  2002  Zhang  and  Firestein  2002 
perhaps due to reduced dependence on olfaction after the gain of trichromatic vision Gilad et al 
2004 This reduction appears to be particularly pronounced in humans Gilad et al 2003 with 
roughly  two-thirds  of  human  ORs  being  pseudogenes  Glusman  et  al  2001  Many  of  these 
inactivation events are still segregating in human populations Menashe et al 2003 suggesting 
that the loss of these genes is ongoing 
We asked whether there was greater than expected overlap between popUncons elements 
and OR genes and found substantial and significant enrichment 123-fold enrichment P0001 
one-tailed  permutation  test  Methods  In  fact  272  of  395  autosomal  ORs  not  annotated  as 
pseudogenes by GENCODE were contained entirely within a popUncons element versus 14425 
expected P0001 one-tailed permutation test while only 17 OR genes reside even partially 
within popCons elements versus 4643 expected P0001 one-tailed permutation test Given 
that background selection may cause a gene to exhibit reduced diversity even if it is not itself the 
target  of  purifying  selection  our  results  imply  that  vast  majority  of  OR  genes  in  the  human 
genome are currently experiencing little if any selective constraint This is consistent with the 
elevated  fraction  of  nonsynonsymous  SNPs  predicted  to  disrupt  protein  function  in  OR  genes 
recently observed by Pierron et al 2012 
We  searched  for  previously  unknown  cases  of  human-specific  LOF  by  examining 
popUncons elements with strong phylogenetic evidence for conservation We identified a total of 
496 popUncons elements of which at least 15 was conserved across vertebrates according to 
phastCons we refer to this set of elements and candidate LOF regions This heuristic cutoff of 
15  conservation  is  three  times  the  genome-wide  average  and  four  times  the  average  within 
popUncons  elements  supplementary  fig  S4A  implying  that  these  regions  were  subject  to 
considerable  selective  constraint  for  the  majority  of  vertebrate  evolution  As  discussed  above 
many of our popUncons elements may contain a small fraction of sites under selective constraint 
This hinders our ability to detect complete loss of function with high confidence However given 
that we have defined LOF candidates as having 15 conservation across vertebrates and they 
exhibit 1856 conservation on average supplementary fig S4B and that our classifier labels 
less than 5 of regions with this level of conservation as popUncons elements Table 1 many 
of  our  496  LOF  candidates  may  have  lost  selective  constraint  at  some  of  these  previously 
conserved sites This finding suggests that the loss of selective constraint on the human branch 
may have been a common occurrence as suggested by Olson 1999 
Because  we  defined  LOF  candidates  as  regions  where  phylogenetic  and  population 
genetic signatures of purifying selection disagree phastCons and popCons respectively they 
may  be  enriched  for  false  positives  especially  if  functional  turnover  is  a  rare  event  It  is 
necessary  to  seek  orthogonal  evidence  that  these  candidates  may  represent  true  losses  of 
functional constraint For this reason we asked whether these candidates were enriched for any 
ontology categories Such information can also aid in the separation of biologically meaningful 
candidates from spurious ones ie candidates associated with an enriched functional category 
may  more  often  represent  true  positives  This  same  line  of  reasoning  also  holds  for  gain  of 
function candidates discussed below 
First we used GREAT McLean et al 2010 to determine whether these candidate LOF 
regions were enriched for particular functional categories compared to the set of all popUncons 
elements  though  the  results  described  below  hold  qualitatively  when  using  the  entire  human 
genome as a background Because GREAT examines genes and their flanking regions it is able 
to identify the enrichment of elements within cis-regulatory regions of genes with a particular 
annotation eg McLean et al 2011 as well as the genes themselves Using GREAT we found 
that a variety of annotation terms were significantly enriched after correcting for multiple testing 
using q-values false discovery rates However the most striking result was the enrichment of 
candidate LOF regions near genes expressed in the nervous system during various developmental 
stages  in  mice  including  the  developing  forebrain  telencephalon  diencephalon  medulla 
oblongata  and  optic  stalk  all  enriched  structures  shown  in  supplementary  table  S7  We 
repeated this analysis on our permuted data sets Methods and found that most of these terms 
very  rarely  if  ever  exhibited  significant  enrichment  at  q005  in  the  permuted  data 
supplementary  table  S7  The  enrichment  of  these  categories  is  driven  largely  by  a  set  of 
transcription factors annotated with the Zinc finger C2H2-typeintegrase DNA-binding InterPro 
domain  which  is  also  enriched  for  the  presence  of  nearby  LOF  candidates  227-fold 
enrichment  false  discovery  rate  q25410-4  This  result  suggests  that  changes  in  the 
transcriptional regulation of genes may have been a common feature on the lineage leading to 
humans  King  and  Wilson  1975  with  regulators  of  brain  development  playing  an  especially 
important  role  We  also  found  that  LOF  candidates  were  significantly  depleted  of  various 
genomic  features  including  exons  disease-associated  mutations  noncoding  RNAs  and 
transcription  factor  binding  sites  supplementary  table  S4  Methods  Together  these  results 
provide additional evidence that at least a portion of sites within many of our LOF candidates 
have recently lost selective constraint 
Several interesting candidate loci emerged from the GREAT analysis For example we 
found  a  LOF  candidate  located  150  bp  downstream  of  the  homeobox  gene  EMX2  fig  3A 
This gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex during embryonic development in mice Simeone et 
al 1992 where it is required for the proper assignment of area identity to neocortical cells as is 
PAX6  Bishop  et  al  2000  another  homeobox  gene  which  itself  has  two  upstream  LOF 
candidates  EMX2  also  plays  a  role  in  the  development  of  the  sensory  and  motor  regions 
Hamasaki et al 2004 The gene is one of two human homologs of the Drosophila gene empty 
spiracles  or  ems  which  is  required  for  development  of  the  head  as  well  as  the  posterior 
spiracles Walldorf and Gehring 1992 We also find a LOF candidate region overlapping the 3 
exon  of  SIM1  fig  3B  the  homolog  of  sim  single-minded  which  is  essential  for  proper 
neurogenesis  in  Drosophila  Thomas  et  al  1988  SIM1  is  associated  with  obesity  in  humans 
Holder et al 2000 and in mice Michaud et al 2001 where it is required for the development 
of the paraventricular nucleus which is responsible for appetite regulation among other functions 
Michaud et al 1998 Another candidate LOF region lies 75 kb downstream of NR4A2 also 
known  as NURR1  a  transcription  factor  expressed  in  the  brain  Law  et  al  1992  where  it  is 
involved  in  the  production  of  dopamine  neurons  in  mice  Saucedo-Cardenas  et  al  1998 
Mutations  in  this  gene  have  been  implicated  in  schizophrenia  Chen  et  al  2001  Parkinsons 
disease Le et al 2002 and bipolar disorder Buervenich et al 2000 Intriguingly NR4A2 has 
experienced a human-specific change in the expression pattern it exhibits over the course of the 
lifespan in the lateral cerebellar cortex Liu et al 2012 which may be involved in language and 
other cognitive functions Rilling 2006 
Additional  transcription  factors  expressed  in  the  mouse  brain  and  involved  in  nervous 
system development and that are flanked or overlapped by candidate LOF regions include two 
zinc  finger  homeobox  genes  involved  in  neuronal  differentiation  ZFHX3  Miura  et  al  1995 
whose  first  coding  exon  overlaps  a  LOF  region  and  ZFHX4  Hemmi  et  al  2006  myelin 
transcription factor 1 MYT1 which is important for oligodenderocyte differentiation Nielsen et 
al 2004 LMX1B which plays a role in hindbrain roof plate development Mishima et al 2009 
NEUROG3 a gene that is important for neuronal determination Sommer et al 1996 and PAX2 
which can result in brain defects in mice when deleted Favor et al 1996 and whose first 3 
exons are contained within a LOF candidate The presence of LOF candidate regions near these 
transcription  factors  suggests  recent  functional  turnover  at  their  regulatory  regions  NR4A2s 
human-specific expression pattern in the brain is consistent with this hypothesis 
One  notable  LOF  candidate  region  not  associated  with  an  enriched  category  is  found 
within the protocadherin  PCDHB cluster on chromosome 5 containing most of PCDHB14 
and the PCDHB18 pseudogene In addition to this LOF region the PCDHB cluster contains four 
additional  popUncons  elements  three  of  which  contain  a  fair  amount  of  conserved  sequence 
according  to  phastCons  though  less  than  our  15  cutoff  for  LOF  candidates  one  element 
containing  PCDHB4  is  made  up  of  103  conserved  sequence  across  vertebrates  a  second 
element encompassing PCDHB6 and the PCDHB17 pseudogene is 83 conserved and a third 
element covering most of PCDHB15 is 7 conserved In total 6 of the 19 PCDHB genes are 
mostly contained within these five popUnCons elements which encompass over one-third of the 
nearly 200 kb gene cluster 
Protocadherin genes including the PCDHB cluster encode cell-cell adhesion molecules 
that  are  believed  to  play  a  role  in  the  formation  of  synaptic  connections  Frank  and  Kemler 
2002 The large number of and functional diversity among these genes may contribute to the 
complexity of the network of synapses in the human brain Shapiro and Colman 1999 Despite 
strong  phylogenetic  evidence  of  purifying  selectioneach  of  the  19  PCDHB  genes  is  largely 
comprised of vertebrate phastCons elementsthere is a fairly high rate of gene turnover in this 
cluster  among  mammals  Vanhalst  et  al  2001  Indeed  3  of  the  19  genes  in  this  cluster  in 
humans are known to be pseudogenes The prevalence of popUncons elements and pseudogenes 
among  the  PCDHB  genes  implies  that  their  selective  constraint  is  considerably  reduced  in 
humans Such a change in selective pressure may have allowed for changes to the neural network 
in the human brain 
Candidate human-specific gain of function events 
As our extensive simulation and cross-validation experiments show we should have excellent 
specificity  for  detecting  human  specific  gains  of  function  GOFs  We  use  a  complementary 
approach to that described above to find GOFsby searching the genome for those regions that 
show  no  signs  of  phylogenetic  conservation  but  are  contained  within  popCons  elements 
Unfortunately  there  are  relatively  few  well-studied  examples  of  previously  nonfunctional 
sequences acquiring function recently in humans We examined three known human-specific de 
novo genes identified by Knowles and McLysaght 2009 CLLU1 C22orf45 and DNAH10OS 
to  see  if  our  approach  could  identify  these  candidates  Two  of  these  genes  C22orf45  and 
DNAH10Os were largely contained within popCons elements However these genes are found 
on  the  opposite  strand  of  more  ancient  and  conserved  genes  thus  negative  selection  on  these 
older  genes  may  be  responsible  for  the  popCons  classification  Interestingly  the  other  gene 
CLLU1  was  found  within  a  popUncons  element  and  exhibits  a  ratio  of  nonsynonymous  to 
synonymous SNPs in the 92nd percentile among all genes Methods suggesting that it may not 
be experiencing strong selective constraint 
While there are not enough known examples of de novo human functional elements for us 
to systematically assess our strategy we can identify candidate GOF regions in a similar vein as 
our  search  for  LOF  regions  To  this  end  we  searched  for  popCons  elements  with  little 
phylogenetic evidence of conservation and found 700 popCons elements composed of 1 of 
base pairs within phastCons elements On average 054 of nucleotides within these regions are 
conserved across vertebrates versus 954 of nucleotides lying within the full set of popCons 
elements  supplementary  fig  S5C-D  These  candidate  GOF  regions  are  enriched  for 
promotersenhancers  identified  by  Cotney  et  al  2013  as  present  in  humans  but  absent  from 
mice as well as small noncoding RNAs with the latter remaining significant after Bonferonni 
correction supplementary table S4 Methods  
As before for loss of function we ran GREAT to identify functional categories of genes 
either overlapping or neighboring candidate GOF regions more often than expected by chance 
using the set of all popCons elements as the background though again we recover similar terms 
when  using  the  whole  genome  as  the  background  Here  we  found  a  striking  pattern  we 
observed  significant  enrichment  of  genes  annotated  with  the  Gene  Ontology  GO  molecular 
function  term  extracellular  ligand-gated  ion  channel  activity  false  discovery  rate  q0045 
Indeed all enriched molecular function terms were related to GABA or other neurotransmitters 
This  enrichment  was  driven  primarily  by  GOFs  near  genes  annotated  with  the  GO  molecular 
function GABA-A receptor activity q0022 GABA -Aminobutyric acid is the nervous 
systems  primary  inhibitory  neurotransmitter  Petroff  2002  and  GABA  receptor  expression 
patterns are known to play a key role in brain development Lujan et al 2005 As for LOFs we 
found that these two terms were enriched at q005 in only a small fraction of our permuted data 
sets  03  and  22  of  permuted  sets  respectively  Human-specific  changes  in  function 
affecting either GABA sequences themselves or their flanking regions could thus have profound 
effects on the CNS We therefore examined these GOF candidates more closely for evidence that 
they may have affected the human CNS after the split with chimpanzees 
We  found  five  GOF  regions  within  a  cluster  of  three  GABA  receptor  subunit  genes 
GABRB3 GABRA5 GABRG3 on chromosome 15 Three of these GOF candidates are located 
downstream of GABRB3 which Liu et al Liu et al 2012 identified as having evolved a human-
specific temporal expression pattern in the prefrontal cortex PFC after the human-chimpanzee 
divergence GABRB3 alleles have also been associated with autism Buxbaum et al 2002 Kim et 
al  2007  savant  skills  Nurmi  et  al  2003  and  epilepsy  Tanaka  et  al  2008  The  other  two 
GOF  candidates  are  located  within  introns  of  GABRG3  These  GOFs  contain  several 
transcription factor binding sites identified by ENCODE ChIP-seq including one 400 bp peak 
observed  in  brain  cancer  cell  lines  among  other  tissues  and  containing  7  human-specific 
substitutions in an alignment of great apes Methods This is a relatively high density of changes 
occurring  on  the  human  branch  fewer  than  25  of  adjacent  500  bp  windows  in  a  whole-
genome great ape alignment exhibit 7 or more human-specific substitutions or indels We also 
observed three GOF regions within a cluster of four GABA receptors on chromosome 5 One of 
these appears within an intron of GABRB2 while the other two flank either side of GABRG2 
which evolved a novel temporal expression pattern in the human PFC according to Liu et al Liu 
et al 2012 Dysfunction of GABRG2 appears to play a role in epilepsy Hirose 2006 Tanaka et 
al  2008  and  alcohol  dependence  Radel  et  al  2005  Another  GOF  candidate  is  located 
upstream  of  GABRA2  on  chromosome  4  which  like  GABRG2  and  GABRB3  experienced  a 
human-specific change in PFC temporal expression pattern Liu et al 2012 GABRA2 is also up-
regulated following neuronal stimulation via exposure to potassium chloride Liu et al 2012 
and has been associated with alcohol dependence Edenberg et al 2004 Dick et al 2006 It is 
also worth noting that we found a LOF candidate within an intron of GABBR2 also singled out 
by Liu et al as having evolved a human-specific expression pattern in the PFC Liu et al 2012 
The proximity of GOF and LOF candidates around GABA receptor genes implies that 
these  candidate  regions  may  be  the  site  of  regulatory  turnover  responsible  for  human-specific 
expression patterns of  these genes in the prefrontal cortex  Moreover the association of these 
genes  with  neurological  phenotypes  such  as  autism  suggests  that  they  play  a  crucial  role  in 
central nervous system development Thus our findings combined with Liu et als observation 
that GABA receptors have experienced an unusually high rate of such changes in expression Liu 
et  al  2012  strongly  suggests  that  human-specific  changes  in  selective  pressure  in  these 
candidate  regions  may  underlie  important  developmental  differences  between  the  brains  of 
humans and chimpanzees 
The signal of GOFs near neurotransmitter receptors is not limited to GABA receptors
we  also  find  several  GOFs  near  subunits  of  receptors  of  glutamate  the  primary  excitatory 
neurotransmitter  in  the  CNS  Glutamate  is  a  GABA  precursor  Petroff  2002  and  glutamate 
signaling  is  vital  for  CNS  development  Lujan  et  al  2005  For  example  we  observe  a  GOF 
candidate upstream of GRIK1 which encodes a glutamate receptor subunit This gene has been 
associated with autism HaldemanEnglert et al 2010 Down syndrome Ghosh et al 2009 and 
juvenile absence epilepsy Sander et al 1997 and its expression levels are altered in patients 
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder Woo et al 2007 We also find a GOF region within an 
intron  and  another  downstream  of  GRIK2  a  glutamate  receptor  subunit  fig  4A  GRIK2  has 
been  linked  to  mental  retardation  Motazacker  et  al  2007  autism  Jamain  et  al  2002  and 
schizophrenia  Bah  et  al  2004  suggesting  an  important  developmental  role  in  the  CNS  In 
addition we find five GOF candidates in the vicinity of GRID2 two upstream and three intronic 
fig 4B another glutamate receptor subunit which interacts directly with GRIK2 Kohda et al 
2003 Deletions in GRID2 can result in cerebellar ataxia and related motor deficits Utine et al 
2013  and  delays  in  cognition  and  speech  Hills  et  al  2013  Both  GRID2  and  GRIK2  were 
identified by Liu et al as evolving a human-specific temporal expression profile in the lateral 
cerebellar cortex Liu et al 2012 
Although zinc finger genes were not enriched for GOF candiates according to GREAT 
two  GOFs  located  upstream  of  the  brain-expressed  ZNF131  Trappe  et  al  2002  are  notable 
because  they  harbor  regulatory  elements  that  may  modulate  its  expression  fig  5  The  GOF 
candidate  closest  to  the  gene  9  kb  upstream  encompasses  a  1051  bp  ORegAnno  element 
Examining the great ape alignment we find 11 human-specific substitutions or indels within the 
ORegAnno elementthis number is within the upper 25 tail of the empirical distribution of 
all  adjacent  1  kb  windows  in  the  genome  These  substitutions  may  have  created  regulatory 
features  unique  to  humans  A  second  GOF  element  is  located  another  19  kb  further  upstream 
containing  another  ORegAnno  element  along  with  two  noncoding  RNAs  with  no  annotated 
function In addition ZNF131 is predicted by UNIPROT to function in the brain 
Overall our results suggest the possibility that a substantial number of regions flanking 
or overlapping genes functioning in the CNS may have gained selective constraint specifically in 
humans We see this pattern from not only the compelling individual cases presented above but 
also from genome-wide enrichments of our predicted GOF elements This pattern could result 
from  the  gain  or  modification  of  regulatory  regions  bringing  about  novel  expression  patterns 
Such changes could in part be responsible for the dramatic differences in structure and function 
between  the  human  brain  and  that  of  other  primates  The  fact  that  many  of  these  genes  have 
recently  changed  expression  patterns  in  the  human  brain  combined  with  the  significant 
enrichment of our GOF candidates for human-specific regulatory elements shows the power of 
our  approach  of  contrasting  phylogenetic  and  population  genetic  data  to  find  human-specific 
change of function 
Concluding remarks 
Understanding which portions of the human genome are functional is a central goal in modern 
biology Here we have developed a supervised machine learning framework to detect purifying 
selection  from  population  genetic  data  alone  Because  our  approach  does  not  examine 
phylogenetic evidence for sequence conservation it can be used to detect recent lineage-specific 
changes in selective pressure We found through extensive simulations and cross-validation on 
the  1000  Genomes  dataset  that  our  method  is  highly  accurate  and  can  be  used  to  identify 
candidate  regions  experiencing  either  gain  or  loss  of  function  occurring  after  the  human-
chimpanzee  divergence  successfully  recovering  known  examples  of  the  latter  Moreover 
because  our  supervised  machine  learning  approach  does  not  depend  on  heavily  parameterized 
models of human demographic history and selection we are able to leverage all available human 
sequence data in our search 
While it has many advantages our method does come with some caveats Because we 
utilize the fraction of segregating sites in a region as well as their allele frequencies variation in 
the spontaneous mutation rate across the genome could impact predictions However because we 
used supervised learning our classifier should be robust to such variation if it is well-represented 
in our training set or if its effect is modest compared to the impact of purifying selection Our 
high accuracy rates show that this is the case 
On  the  other  hand  our  method  does  appear  to  be  confounded  by  balancing  selection 
which is expected to increase variability within the population For example the HLA loci the 
ABO locus and the hemoglobin HBB gene which are all highly polymorphic and believed to be 
experiencing  balancing  selection  Allison  1954  Hedrick  and  Thomson  1983  Saitou  and 
Yamamoto 1997 Stajich and Hahn 2005 are all classified as unconstrained by our method This 
limitation of our method is probably a minor one as balancing selection in the human genome 
appears to be the exception rather than the rule Bubb et al 2006 Leffler et al 2013 
Our  method  may  also  be  confounded  by  selective  sweeps  which  we  suspect  will  be 
classified as constrained because sweeps reduce the number of segregating sites and skew the 
SFS away from intermediate-frequency variants though an excess of high-frequency variants is 
also observed at flanking sites Fay and Wu 2000 This issue may not greatly affect accuracy as 
regions  experiencing  selective  sweeps  must  contain  functional  DNA  and  as  with  balancing 
selection such sweeps seem to have little impact on human polymorphism genome-wide in any 
case  Hernandez  et  al  2011  Lohmueller  et  al  2011  However  strong  selective  sweeps  can 
reduce diversity in large regions potentially greatly inflating the inferred size of the functional 
region Given sufficient numbers of examples of targets of positive or balancing selection one 
could in principle train an SVM to identify these types of loci as well Finally our approach may 
not be able to differentiate recent changes in selective pressure affecting multiple lineages eg 
occurring  prior  to  the  human-chimpanzee  split  from  truly  lineage-specific  changes  Dense 
polymorphism  data  from  multiple  species  would  allow  us  to  discriminate  between  these  two 
cases 
Despite  these  limitations  our  approach  appears  to  be  quite  useful  for  identifying 
candidate human-specific gains and losses of function Indeed while we cannot directly show 
that  these  candidate  regions  have  experienced  recent  changes  in  selective  constraint  the 
clustering of such candidates in loci affecting CNS development and exhibiting novel expression 
patterns in the human brain suggest that many of these candidates represent true gains or losses 
of  function  responsible  for  key  human-specific  traits  and  that  such  functional  turnover  is 
common  on  evolutionary  timescales  Furthermore  our  method  is  complementary  to  previous 
strategies  for  identifying  lineage-specific  changes  in  selective  pressure  For  example  searches 
for sequences highly conserved in other species but evolving rapidly in humans reveals regions 
likely responsible for important human-specific adaptations Pollard et al 2006a Pollard et al 
2006b Kostka et al 2012 however the acquisition of new functional elements need not occur 
in previously conserved regions or be accompanied by a burst of substitution Our approach does 
not depend on either of these two assumptions Unfortunately our resolution is currently limited 
by the relatively low density of polymorphism in humans Nonetheless the results presented here 
demonstrate the promise of leveraging population genetic data to detect selective constraint an 
approach whose power will improve as more human genomes are sequenced

SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS 
Assessing classification accuracy using forward simulations 
In order to assess the accuracy of our classification approach we used SLiM Messer 2013 to 
perform forward simulations of 10 kilobase regions the same window size we used for real data 
see below evolving strictly under drift containing a region experiencing purifying selection or 
experiencing positive selection across the entire region For our simulations including purifying 
selection we set the selection coefficient 2Ns where N is the initial total population size and 1-s 
and 1-05s are the fitnesses of homozygotes and heterozygotes respectively to either 50 100 or 
500 and set the length of the constrained region L to either 25 kb 5 kb 75 kb or the full 10 kb 
window The start of this constrained region was always located on the left end of the simulated 
chromosome  Each  of  these  simulations  followed  the  demographic  scenario  reported  by 
Tennessen et al 2012 which models the divergence of Europeans from the ancestral African 
population  and  subsequent  population  size  changes  for  these  two  populations  For  these 
simulations we set the mutation rate to 1210-8 mutations per base pair Kong et al 2012 in 
some instances or to reduced 610-9 or elevated 2410-8 rates in others Similarly we set the 
recombination  rate  to  either  110-8  crossovers  per  base  pair  or  1  cMMb  or  to  reduced  or 
elevated values of 110-6 or 110-7 respectively 
For  each  combination  of  2Ns  L  mutation  rate  and  recombination  rate  we  performed 
500  independent  replicate  simulations  for  training  and  testing  our  classifier  Each  of  these 
simulations was initialized from a burn-in simulation proceeding for 4000000 generations under 
equilibrium  demography  using  the  same  combination  of  2Ns  L  mutation  rate  and 
recombination rate From each of the 500 replicate simulations we sampled 1000 chromosomes 
without  replacement  form  each  of  the  two  subpopulations  simulated  in  the  Tennessen  et  al 
model 2012 yielding a total sample size of 2000 individuals We ran all burn-in and replicate 
simulations  using  a  version  of  SLiM  that  we  modified  to  simulate  additive  rather  than 
multiplicative fitness effects We then summarized the output of each simulated window by the 
feature vector 0 1 2  n-1 where n is the number of chromosomes in the sample i is the 
fraction of sites in the window with a derived allele segregating at frequency i except 0 which 
is the fraction of sites in the window that are monomorphic including derived fixations The 
feature vector  is thus the site frequency spectrum SFS modified to divide the value in each 
bin by the number of sites rather than the number of polymorphisms and to include the fraction 
of sites that are monomorphic 
Next for each combination of 2Ns L mutation and recombination rates we sought to 
train an SVM to classify simulated regions as constrained or unconstrained based on their feature 
vectors    First  we  constructed  a  training  set  using  the  output  from  300  simulations  with  no 
selection  and  300  windows  including  a  region  experiencing  negative  selection  We  performed 
additional simulations to construct a balanced test set 200 selected and 200 unselected windows 
with  the  same  parameter  combination  for  later  use  For  each  combination  of  2Ns  and  L  we 
constructed training and test sets were also with variable mutation rates variable recombination 
rates  or  both  by  drawing  equal  numbers  of  simulated  examples  from  each  of  the  three  rate 
values listed above Next we collapsed these feature vectors to contain 1000 bins as we found 
that this amount of binning improved cross-validation accuracy on our training set made from 
real genomic data see below We then formatted feature vectors for these training and test sets 
for use by LIBSVM Chang and Lin 2011 and rescaled them using the svm-scale command 
with default scaling parameters the training and test sets were concatenated together for this step 
along  with  positively  selected  simulations  see  below  to  ensure  the  same  scaling  parameters 
were used for both sets 
We then used LIBSVMs svm-train command with a radial basis kernel function to learn 
the hyperplane optimally separating the conserved and unconserved training data according to 
the  SVMs  C  parameter  Cortes  and  Vapnik  1995  The  hyperplane  chosen  and  therefore  its 
accuracy when classifying data not included in the training set depend on this C parameter and 
the  radial  basis  functions    parameter  We  therefore  performed  a  grid  search  of  these  two 
parameter values examining all powers of two between 2-11 and 29 for each parameter For each 
combination  of  C  and    we  performed  10-fold  cross  validation  in  order  to  assess  the  SVMs 
accuracy We then used the optimal combination of hyperparameters to train an SVM from the 
entire training set and assessed the accuracy of this SVM using the test set 
In some cases the optimal combination of the C and gamma  yielded poor accuracy on 
the test set only when using LIBSVMs option to compute posterior classification probabilities 
in  such  cases  the  classification  probability  for  the  feature  vector  being  classified  was  nearly 
always exactly 05 for both classes We only observed this behavior when one or both of the C or 
 hyperparameters was very small ie 2-6 or less We therefore slightly modified our grid search 
procedure  to  obtain  all  hyperparameter  combinations  with  a  cross-validation  accuracy  value 
within 1 of that of the optimal combination and then selected from these the combination with 
the smallest sum of log2Clog2 thereby punishing hyperparameters whose base-2 exponent 
differed  greatly  from  zero  After  this  modification  all  grid  searches  produced  SVMs  that  had 
similar performance on the test set as on the training set and emitted a more continuous range of 
probability estimates Crucially the poor posterior probability estimation described above was 
not exhibited by the final SVM learned from the 1000 Genomes data as described below which 
produced  a  more  uniform  range  of  probability  estimates  and  whose  performance  we  also 
assessed using independent test sets 
We  also  simulated  a  set  of  400  population  samples  experiencing  recurrent  positive 
selection  with  each  mutation  at  each  site  in  the  chromosome  being  positively  selected  with 
2Ns100 where homozygote and heterozygote fitness values are 1s and 105s respectively 
We then asked what fraction of these positively selected samples were classified as negatively 
selected or unselected by each SVM For these simulations the mutation rate was set to 1210-8 
and the recombination rate to 110-8
