Since the event horizon of a black hole is a surface of innite redshift it might
be thought that Hawking radiation would be highly sensitive to Lorentz violation
at high energies
In fact the opposite is true for subluminal dispersion For
superluminal dispersion however the outgoing black hole modes emanate from
the singularity in a state determined by unknown quantum gravity processes
As evidenced by this meeting there is a growing feeling that Lorentz invari-
ance should be questioned and tested Tentative results from from quantum
gravity and string theory hint that the ground state may not be Lorentz invari-
ant and new techniques are allowing for experiments with unprecedented preci-
sion and astrophysical observations at unprecedented high energies Moreover
due to the unboundedness of the boost parameter exact Lorentz invariance
while mathematically elegant is unveriable and therefore suspect
Most work exploring possible Lorentz violation has focused on non grav-
itational physicsie at spacetime Much less has been done to investigate
Lorentz breaking in curved spacetime or in gravitational phenomena them-
selves The event horizon of a black hole being a surface of innite redshift
is a particularly good probe of the limits of boost invariance at high ener-
gies Since Hawking radiation emerges from the vicinity of the horizon it is
therefore interesting to investigate the impact of Lorentz violation on Hawking
radiation To pursue this question however one must rst address another
question if Lorentz violation exists what becomes of general relativity
In at spacetime Lorentz breaking is described by couplings to constant
symmetry breaking tensors Va Wab 
 To formulate Lorentz breaking in
a curved spacetime without destroying general covariance such tensors must
become dynamical tensor elds elds that satisfy eective eld equations
An implementation of this with a unit timelike vector uax as the Lorentz
breaking eld is the subject of another contribution to these proceedings 12
Such a eld preserves rotation invariance and since it is a unit vector contains
no information other than the determination of a preferred rest frame at each
point of spacetime For the present purposes let us just imagine that some
such implementation exists
Hawking radiation is thermal radiation emitted from a black hole For a
black hole with surface gravity  the Hawking temperature is TH  h2c
A nonrotating black hole has a surface gravity c22RS where RS is the
Schwarzschild radius hence the thermal wavelength is H  82RS This
is the typical wavelength of the Hawking radiation far from the black hole
after it has climbed out of the potential well of the hole Following the ra-
diation backwards all the way to the horizon however it recedes into the
vacuum uctuations and the wavelength goes to zero as measured by an ob-
server falling freely across the event horizon The Hawking radiation therefore
originates from Planck or trans-Planck scale vacuum uctuations which may
be governed by completely unknown physics if Lorentz invariance is broken
The essence of the Hawking eect is independent of eld mass or interac-
tions hence it is adequate for the present purposes to consider a free massless
eld The propagation of the eld near the horizon can be inferred in the WKB
approximation from the dispersion relation and Lorentz violation can be pa-
rameterized by modications of the dispersion relation Consider for example
dispersion relations of the form
  k  k1nkn
where  is the frequency k is the magnitude of the wave 3-vector kP is the
Planck wave vector and units with c  1 are employed The dimensionless pa-
rameter  controls the amount of Lorentz violation and the integer n determines
its k dependence The case n  0 is scale independent and corresponds to the
renormalizable Lorentz violation one has in the standard model extension3 In
the case n  0 the Lorentz violation grows stronger at higher energies The
group velocity vg  ddk for the dispersion relation 1 is given by
vg  1  1  nkkP n
which is superluminal if   0 and subluminal if   0 The frequency and
spatial wave 3-vector in 1 are dened with respect to the preferred frame ua

To investigate the consequences of Lorentz breaking for the Hawking eect
it is rst of all necessary to specify the prole of the preferred frame in the
black hole spacetime In spherical symmetry a natural frame is the radial free-
fall frame which is determined by the geodesics that are asymptotically at rest
at spatial innity and fall freely across the horizon Whether this particular
frame would be dynamically selected by the eective eld theory is unknown
However it seems reasonable to assume as I will here that the preferred frame
is well-behaved at the horizon This means that it has nite velocity with
respect to the free fall frame and that the invariant 4-acceleration is not large
compared to the surface gravity 
We can now examine how Lorentz violation might aect the propagation
of elds near a black hole horizon Consider rst the n  0 case for which
the group velocity is the k-independent constant 1   For negative  this
is less than the speed of light so the eective horizon moves out
In fact
the dispersion relation is identical to that of a Lorentz invariant massless eld
coupled to the metric g 
narrower than those of gab so the horizon is moved out relative to that of gab
A matter eld with such dispersion would exhibit the usual Hawking eect
with a temperature determined by the surface gravity of the g 
ab horizon For
positive  the group velocity is instead greater than the speed of light so the
g  light cones are opened up and the horizon moves inward
ab  gab  2  2uaub The light cones of g 
For n  0 the situation is much more interesting4 Let us rst consider the
case where  is positive Then the group velocity is superluminal as with n 
0 and grows with k This means that as an outgoing wavepacket is followed
backwards in time toward the horizon it speeds up and crosses the horizon
continuing to go faster until it approaches the curvature singularity inside the
black hole In other words the outgoing mode emerged from the vicinity of
the singularity and propagated superluminally out across the horizon nally
redshifting enough to slow down to the speed of light
Needless to say this is very dierent from the usual Hawking eect In the
usual case the outgoing mode is stuck just outside the horizon exponentially
blueshifting backwards in time The Hawking eect is deduced from a vacuum
condition imposed on the quantum eld near the horizon namely that outgoing
modes with frequency    are in their ground state as seen by a free-fall
observer This physically reasonable condition need not refer to any Planck
or trans-Planck scale quantities It merely expresses the hypothesis that after
the black hole formed there is no process going on that could excite these
modes However due to the continued blueshift backwards in time it cannot
be deduced from the initial conditions before the collapse that formed the black
hole without reference to trans-Planckian quantities In this sense the usual
Hawking eect is a robust prediction of Lorentz invariant eld theory
In the presence of n  0 superluminal dispersion however the outgoing
modes emerge from the vicinity of the singularity inside the black hole where
unknown physics takes place If they emerge in their ground state then the
usual Hawking eect would occur But something entirely dierent might
happen and indeed seems more plausible since the modes propagate through
a region of diverging spacetime curvature
Finally let us consider the case of negative  The group velocity is then
subluminal and decreases with increasing k In this case as rst shown by
Unruh 5 an outgoing wavepacket originates as an ingoing wavepacket con-
taining typical wavevectors of order kP  which is outgoing with respect to the
preferred frame but not fast enough to compensate for the infalling of that
frame Thus the wavepacket is dragged towards the horizon As this happens
the wavepacket redshifts and near the horizon it nally redshifts enough for
its group velocity to exceed the infall speed of the preferred frame At this
point it turns around and nally climbs away from the horizon continuing to
redshift on the way out This sort of continuous evolution of a mode from one
type to another with a change of group velocity in response to propagation
through an inhomogeneous medium is well known is various other areas of
physics It is called mode conversion in the plasma physics literature
Now what does this mode conversion imply for the Hawking eect Ac-
tually it makes no dierence The same physical reasoning as in the Lorentz
invariant case supports the hypothesis that the outgoing modes with   
near the horizon are in their ground state as seen by free fall observers The
only dierence is in the ancestry of the modes In the Lorentz invariant case
the modes have trans-Planckian ancestry due to the continued exponential
blueshifting at the horizon and they originate as ingoing modes that arrive at
the horizon just before it forms from the collapse that produced the black hole
In the dispersive case on the other hand the ancestor is only Planckian and
it originates as an ingoing or rather dragged-in outgoing mode that arrives
at the horizon after the black hole forms It was shown numerically in Ref 5
using a dispersion relation for which the group velocity vanishes at large k
that if these ingoing modes are in their ground state far from the black hole
then the usual Hawking ux emerges as long as   kP 
A weakness in the above account is that the model breaks down if one
attempts to trace the ingoing mode all the way back out to spatial innity since
the wavelength gets arbitrarily blueshifted in the process An improved model
would start from some sort of discreteness for spacetime with a physically
sensible short distance cuto The Hawking eect has been studied in such a
model in which space is treated as a lattice that falls freely into a black hole
in 11 dimensions6
Linear elds propagating on the lattice naturally have subluminal disper-
sion at high wavevectors For a lattice with spacing a the dispersion relation
is   2a sinka2 Wavevectors diering by 2a are identied so the
independent modes are labelled by the so-called Brillouin zone a a
The group velocity vanishes for k  a and it is negative for yet higher
wavevectors which are identied with negative wavevectors The wavepacket
propagation picture discussed above suggests that mode conversion would take
place outside a black hole horizon with an outgoing wavepacket of small posi-
tive k components arising from an ingoing packet of k components greater than
a This is analogous to a Bloch oscillation which occurs when a charged
particle in a periodic potential is subjected to a uniform electric eld This be-
havior was conrmed by numerical propagation of a scalar eld wavepacket on
a falling lattice using the lattice eld equation Moreover assuming the ingo-
ing modes are in their quantum ground states the Hawking radiation thermal
occupation numbers for the outgoing modes were found as long as the lattice
spacing was small compared with the length scale 1 of the black hole
In this falling lattice model the slow time-dependent spreading of the lattice
points is critical to producing the net frequency change of the mode that we
know must occur if the Hawking eect is to take place Such rarefaction of the
lattice is an articial feature of this simple 11 dimensional model however
Moreover in any process involving modes with Planckian wavevectors the
linear model of the test eld is surely unjustied The back-reaction on the
quantum gravity vacuum must be essential It seems unavoidable to suppose
that the uctuations of the actual quantum gravity vacuum obviate the need for
the explicit time dependence of the falling lattice and that the dynamics of this
vacuum provides a non-linear way of partially converting ingoing uctuations
to outgoing ones
In conclusion Lorentz violation is entirely compatible with the usual un-
derstanding of black holes in general relativity including the Hawking eect
except in the case of superluminal dispersion with a group velocity that grows
without bound at high wavevectors In that case modes emanating from the
vicinity of the singularity would emerge from the black hole their state having
been determined by unknown quantum gravity processes
