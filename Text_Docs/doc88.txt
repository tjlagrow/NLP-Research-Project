INTRODUCTION
Galaxy redshift surveys are outstanding tools for observational cosmology
Mapping the universe as outlined by galaxies leads to fundamental measure-
ments which rene our knowledge of its structure and evolution Redshift
acquisition has undergone tremendous progress thanks to advances in technol-
ogy and redshift surveys appear nowadays as routine Even though they may
look simple at face-value the strategy of a survey and the galaxy-selection
criteria have crucial impacts on the interpretation of results Since galaxies
are directly observable point-like tracers of dark matter halos they represent
only the tip of the iceberg of what drives the evolution of the universe Hence
interpretation of these surveys via model-dependent approaches such as semi-
analytical models N-body simulations provide also fundamental insights into
galaxy evolution and formation Redshift surveys can be analyzed using many
dierent statistical techniques to give measurements of clustering large-scale
structures velocity elds luminosity functions weak-lensing
In this lecture I concentrate on one of these measurements ie the galaxy
luminosity function LF and its evolution
In particular I consider the LF
derived from optically magnitude-selected eld galaxy redshift surveys The
LF is a fundamental measurement of the statistical properties of the popula-
tion of galaxies it is the comoving number density of galaxies as a function
of their intrinsic luminosity The luminosity of a galaxy evolves according to
the evolution of its content see lectures of Charlot and Matteucci and ac-
L Tresse
cording to its interactionmass accretionmerging history Measuring the LF
at dierent cosmic epochs enables us to quantify its changes and to assess the
evolution in the galaxy population Early work on galaxy number counts as a
test for evolution has largely been superseded by large redshift surveys which
allow the direct determination of the LF from which the observed Nm and
Nz can be reproduced and better understood Ultra deep number counts are
still used at depths where automatic redshift acquisition is not yet possible
see Fergusons lecture for an up-to-date review of number counts I discuss
only eld galaxies which are selected without regard to their environment or
any special properties hence their study is representative of the global galaxy
population LFs have also been measured from samples which select only ei-
ther AGN galaxies or radio galaxies or H emitters or galaxies in clusters
or clusters etc These latter measurements determine the evolution of single
populations but the completely dierent selection means that their connection
to the eld galaxy population is not straightforward With large distant and
multi-wavelength surveys of eld galaxies it will be possible to measure the LF
for the global population and for each of these special subsamples and thus
to relate them more easily at dierent epochs
The aim of this lecture is to describe the approach to designing state-of-
the-art of galaxy surveys and their impact on measurements on LFs I start
by discussing survey strategies which I consider to be the most important
step Section 2 I continue by describing the data required Section 3 and
then review the dierent estimators to measure LFs Section 4 I discuss the
LF evolution Section 5 and I follow by summarizing the status of LF mea-
surements Section 6 I would like to emphasize that a survey for which one
can dene and quantify the biases and selection criteria is more useful in the
long term than a survey for which they are not well determined no matter
how pioneering the work is Indeed comparing data from dierent surveys is
a nightmare and comparing them to models is even less straightforward All
surveys have dierent selections biases and methodologies and so the interpre-
tation of apparent discrepancies should be done with care before invoking any
exotic explanations The references quoted for the surveys are usually those es-
timating the LF references for the series of papers issued from a survey should
be found within
2 SURVEY STRATEGIES
A survey strategy includes choices and constraints at several levels some of
which are described in this section If not well-dened and well-controlled poor
choices can produce unknown biases toward certain types of galaxy which will
hinder and confuse analysis of the survey
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
21 From the local to deep universe
One crucial aspect of the preparation of a redshift survey is to nd a balance
between the sky coverage ie the area of sky in which galaxies are selected for
spectroscopic observations the sampling rate ie the number of spectroscopic
targets out of the number of photometric objects within a magnitude range
and reasonable observing times which depend on the detectors and telescopes
used If these are not handled it leads to major diculties to interpret and
compare LFs and even worse for correlation functions or close-pair analysis
Observational strategies are quite dierent for the local universe z  01 and
the distant universe z  01
What matters for the local universe z  01 is the large sky coverage indeed
any single small area is strongly aected by density inhomogeneities Until
recently the way to survey large areas was to use photographic plates of 25
sq deg eld of view The SDSS 38 will be the rst large local survey with
galaxies selected from CCDs For local surveys the magnitude limit is about
B 16 and exposure time required for a spectrum is a few minutes A full
sampling strategy is necessary when aiming to rene the local structures CfA2
42 SSRS2 11 see da Costas lecture but is time consuming over several
years changes in detectors strategies lead to disparities within one sample
Meanwhile sparse-sampling strategies have also been adopted SAPM 35 or a
collection of pencil-beams KOSS 27 While these previous surveys observed
spectra one by one wide-eld multi-object spectroscopy has been more recently
used by AutobLDSS 15 LCRS 33 CS 21 and ESP 58 surveys The on-
going 2dF 41 and SDSS use even larger multiplex gain respectively 2x200
and 2x320 bers in one exposure 1 hour Sampling galaxies B 195 these
will have a mean depth of z 01
Pushing deeper 02  z  13 and with multi-object spectroscopy redshift
surveys see references in Table 2 are done in pencil beams of few arcmins
with faint magnitude limit B  24 and long exposure spectra few hours
The acquisition of several pencil beams is necessary either to cover contiguous
patches on the sky or to sample dierent elds of view over the sky and several
exposures are usually required on the same eld One of the original aim of
these surveys was the LFs and also clustering indeed studying structures
is reliable only with larger areas Surveys at 13  z  27 require detectors
sensitive in the infrared since no strong spectral features are observed in the
optical wavelength range This cosmic epoch will very soon be surveyed by 8m
class telescope see lecture of Le Fevre For higher redshifts z  4  5 the
existing redshift survey 54 has selected only a certain type of galaxies the
Lyman break population Systematic redshift surveys in this range will be
also conducted with 8m telescopes The universe at z  5 is still an unknown
regime but some models suggest that there is a population of galaxies already
formed
If such a population exists the distances between galaxies or any
subgalactic mass undergoing star formation will be smaller and the apparent
size of galaxies larger leading to very crowded elds Thus methods such
L Tresse
as Integral Field Unit may be chosen rather than traditional MOS and are
under studies in particular for the Next Generation Space Telescope as well as
Micro-Mirror or Micro-Shutter Arrays MOS see NGST - Science Drivers 
Technological Challenges 34th Liege International Astrophysics Colloquium
June 1998 ESA Publications
22 MOS modes
Each survey using multi-object spectroscopy MOS has biases introduced by
the constraints inherent to the particular MOS mode used For instance when
using ber multiplex a set of bers is placed on objects while another set is
placed on sky Since the sky spectrum is measured through dierent bres than
the galaxies the throughput and spectral response will be dierent and this
can lead to poor sky subtraction especially for faint galaxies whose ux is a
small fraction of sky Also bres typically cannot be placed closer than 20
from one another which leads to a bias against close pairs of galaxies unless
elds are observed several times Using slit multiplex a slit is placed on an
object including sky on both side and can include close objects However
while the output spectrum from a set of bers is arbitrarily reorganized on
the CCD it is not the case with slits for which the spectrum is dispersed
on both sides of the aperture location on the CCD No other objects can be
observed in the CCD area covered by the spectrum within one observation This
produces non-uniform selection patterns in the dispersion direction ie some
areas are more sampled than others Depending on the number of observations
or the sampling rate aimed these eects can be reduced but at the cost of
the volume surveyed within a certain allocated time Basically the number of
possible slitsbers to be positioned on galaxies is function of galaxy density
related to the magnitude range sampled and the number of observations on
the same sky area Thus to get a 100 sampling is somewhat time consuming
A compromise has to be reached between the full use of the multiplex gain
and the uniformity in x y of the galaxies selected There are even more
subtle biases with both MOS modes The quantication of such eects is not
straightforward simulations are helpful to measure them and take them into
account in statistical analysis
23 A priori selections
One common pre-selection for objects to be observed in spectroscopy mode is
the galaxystar separation Depending on the survey magnitude range the
number of stars can be so high that it is necessary to do this pre-selection to
avoid spending most of the time observing stars For instance in the SAPM
magnitude range 15  bJ  17 see 36 stars are 95 of the objects However
the galaxystar separation techniques are not 100 reliable for example such
pre-selection is likely to exclude compact galaxies in the APM it has been
estimated at 5 40 For deep surveys this is less crucial For instance in the
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
CFRS magnitude range 17  I  22 no-preselection was done and depending
on the eld galactic latitudes from 10 to 30 of objects were stars of mostly
M and K types Another pre-selection is to choose the objects by eye
these cases nice objects close objects peculiar objects will tend to be selected
introducing a non-controlled bias
24 Photometric choices
Objects in redshift surveys were usually selected from one pass-band of wave-
lengths and this leads to a preference for a certain type of galaxy Since the
detectors were the most sensitive in the blue the rst redshift surveys selected
galaxies from their ux received around 4400 A Thus the observed rest-frame
luminosity spans the ultraviolet wavelengths 44001  z and this comes
down to select galaxies mostly on their current star-formation activity The
UV emission is known to be strongly dust extinguished for instance the ux
is reduced by a factor 2  3 for galaxies at z 02 55 and is usually much
fainter than the optical for spiral and elliptical galaxies Hence galaxies be-
come dicult to detect especially at z  05 and those observed are likely to be
only the strong star-forming galaxy population Recent deep surveys selected
galaxies from their red or infrared observed ux This enables us to observe
galaxies at z  05 more easily since the spanned rest-frame light lies in the
optical This selection is closer to the galaxy mass regardless the current star-
forming activity and so the observed population is more representative of the
total galaxy population
Single pass-band surveys select galaxy populations which are never fully ho-
mogeneous from one cosmic epoch to another To quantify the fraction and
type of galaxies over or under-observed is not straightforward and requires
multi-color selected samples This leads to LF measurements at various epochs
which are derived from dierent observed galaxy populations and it has to
be handled with care when studying evolution of LF Color-selected samples
searching for the Lyman break or UV dropout are recently used for galaxies
at z  3 but select only the galaxy population for which this break is de-
tectable 54 With large on-going multi-wavelength surveys several samples
of multi-color selection should be more homogeneous
Another important selection criterion is the way the magnitudes are mea-
sured and thus how the objects are selected Photographic magnitudes are
more dicult to calibrate than CCD magnitudes due to the non-linearity and
saturation occurring in photographic plates these eects are non trivial to cor-
rect even when calibrating with a sub-set of CCD magnitudes To be complete
down to a certain magnitude in a single band the best is to use total magni-
tudes However since the outer part of galaxies is usually below the threshold
detection ie a small fraction of the surface brightness of the night sky in
practice total magnitudes are not measured directly and are retrieved from
aperture or isophotal magnitudes Recovering for the lost ux can be subject
to systematic errors and ultimately requires knowledge of the surface brightness
L Tresse
SB prole and thus most surveys quote a photometric completeness based
on their choice of ux measurement
Actually catalogues are limited by an apparent magnitude a SB and a size
The usual truncation of a catalogue to a magnitude limit results in biases in SB
and size which add complexity when comparing surveys or when recovering
the galaxy densities see for instance 46 24 and references within Isophotal
magnitudes include a varying fraction of the total ux due the 1  z4 SB
dimming eect and dierent galaxy SB proles to be close to the total magni-
tude the adopted isophote limit must correspond to about 6 magnitudes fainter
than the total magnitude for instance if mtot  22 SB  28 mag arcsec2
31 Petrosian magnitudes integrate the ux within a radius determined by
the ratio of the mean SB within radius r to the local surface brightness at r
45 Aperture magnitudes can be used with an empirical t to the galaxy
light-growth curve to integrate the ux within an area close to the total ux
emitting area the required galaxy image center is usually recovered from an
isophotal measurement For instance Kron aperture magnitudes 28 inte-
grate the ux within a radius which is a multiple of the rst moment radius
r1 of the intensity-weighted radial prole rKron  2r1 The integrated ux
with these methods reliably reaches 90-95 of the total ux Some complica-
tions occur when galaxy images overlap or when strong emitting regions in the
outer disk can be taken mistaken for another object
To be complete down to a certain color the light must be integrated from
the same emitting area of a galaxy This can be done within a xed aperture
and considering the same center for dierent pass-band images or using an
isophotal area dened from the sum of these images Magnitudes that are
close to total magnitudes are the most attractive to use in dening a sample
because it is then easy to select well-dened sub-samples as for instance a
xed aperture magnitude sample for work on a color-selected sample Starting
from a xed aperture-selected sample it is not possible to generate a sample
complete to a given total magnitude Total magnitudes are also attractive to
study low-surface brightness and intrinsically faint galaxies
25 Spectroscopic choices
The choice of the spectral resolution  has an impact on the success rate
for measuring a z For instance if the observed z range related to the mag-
nitude range is large a low-resolution allows to observe a large wavelength
range and increases the chances to observe an emission line as the common
O ii andor the Balmer break On the contrary a high-resolution is better
to work out the spectral properties of galaxies including H H d4000 H
O ii measurements for star-formation rate metallicity and spectral classi-
cation With new infrared detectors to observe galaxies at 1  z  3 a high
resolution is better to correct for the strong OH sky emission and assure the z
measurement Another point is that it is preferable to span wavelengths that
are within the lter-band of selection for galaxies so that the spectroscopy com-
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
pleteness correlates with the photometric observations To measure a z ux
calibration is not necessary However again if the spectral properties are stud-
ied at several z it is better to obtain calibrated spectra Spectro-photometric
calibration also enables us to correct for aperture light losses Several expo-
sures are required to lter out the cosmics A signal-to-noise of 10 or more is
required if one wants to avoid a bias against spectra with weak features The
choice of the aperture has also its importance in the success rate for nding
a redshift slits of  15 are usually used for deep surveys The success rates
for redshift surveys can reach levels of 90 and are usually function of the
magnitude at the faint limit of a survey incompleteness can be very large
3 BASIC DATA REQUIRED TO MEASURE LF
The basic data needed for each targeted object of a survey are the redshift z
the relative magnitude m and the galaxy type It is important that each step
is well-dened so that the redshift completeness function and the uncertainties
in the absolute magnitude determination can be established for the survey
31 Redshifts
The method to measure z from a sky-subtracted optical spectrum is to identify
a set of spectral features which have the same obsrest  1z Note that
rest  2000A is measured in the air while rest  2000A in the vacuum in this
last case 1  z has to be multiplied by the refractive index of air n  10029
The reliability of z is correlated to the number of features and their signal-to-
noise for instance a single strong emission line is not sucient to determine
securely a z also for a set of several weak features for these cases colors may
be helpful to secure z see below The simplest way to measure z is to t
individual lines andor to cross-correlate with template spectra Now that
thousands of spectra are taken by night fully automatic measurements of z
are necessary hence supplementary procedures have been developed using for
instance Principal Component Analysis PCA techniques see eg
9 The
dicult task of such automation is to account for all possible situations as
for instance the diversity of spectra from extremely blue to red spectra from
QSO to stellar spectra from featureless spectra to very reddened spectra the
problems in the spectra bad sky subtraction etc Such things could be easily
judged by eye but with the large on-going and future surveys it is impractical
to look at them one by one
In the optical window 40009000A the strongest features are O ii 3727
the Balmer break at 4000A H O iii 49595007 H N ii 65486583
S ii 67186731 and followed by H H CaH CaK With O ii in the
optical one can determine z until 14 about then no strong features appear
in the optical until z 22 where Ly 1215A can be observed To cover the
missing region detectors sensitive in the near infrared window 0915m are
L Tresse
required to still observe at least O ii
In principle measured redshifts must be transformed from the Earth to the
Sun system heliocentric z then to the galactic center galactocentric z This
represents about 300 km s1 or 0001 in z In the very nearby universe z 
003 peculiar velocities of galaxies are not negligible compare to the Hubble
radial velocity ow of 300500 km s1 ie when vradial  10000 km s1
The accuracy usually aimed is better than 0001 in z Another point is that
absorption lines do not always give the same z as emission lines velocities
can dier by up to 500 km s1 This is usually explained by the fact that
emission lines originate in dierent regions than absorption lines and that this
eect is enhanced when galaxies are seen edge-on
Another way to determine redshifts is to use the colors of a galaxy which
corresponds to using an extremely poor resolution spectrum since a color is
the integrated ux over several wavelengths Thus they are inferred from the
spectrum shape and mainly from the location of the discontinuities in the
continuum Balmer Lyman breaks These redshifts are called photometric
redshifts they rely strongly on the knowledge of the spectral energy distribution
and its evolution for any type of galaxies and cannot give precise measurement
To avoid catastrophic identications UV and IR colors are absolutely essential
and the error in z is reduced to 003 in z 8 They were rst used when
acquisition of spectra was extremely time consuming and have recently came
back to fashion to estimate redshifts of very distant galaxies as seen in the
Hubble Deep Field where spectroscopy requires at least 8m telescopes They
are particularly useful in the presently region at z  14  22 where there are
no strong optical features Actually they are a useful technique to estimate
the z of a galaxy and thus to select the window optical or infrared thus the
instrument in which prominent features are likely to be seen in spectroscopy
If no redshift can be measured for a galaxy then it is part of the redshift
incompleteness of the survey It is important to quantify this as a function of
magnitude and to understand where it may come from only low SB galaxies
only high-z galaxies problem with the slitber etc
32 Absolute magnitudes
Magnitudes are determined in a well-dened pass-band such as B V R I or
K Denoting the band as j the absolute magnitude is Mj  mj DM kj Aj
where DM is the modulus distance depending only on the world model cho-
sen H0 and q0 m the apparent magnitude k the correction necessary to
express all magnitudes in the same rest-frame lter band and A the galactic
extinction This is the classical way to measure absolute magnitudes in redshift
surveys which minimizes model-dependent inputs Then when comparing with
models these magnitudes can be corrected as wished for the predicted lumi-
nosity evolution of a certain type of galaxy at z in the same rest-frame band
and for reddening produced by the dust extinction intrinsic at each galaxy
However accounting only for the k-correction the measure of M is already

model-dependent assuming a world model Depending on the galaxy type
the model-dependent term of k-corrections spans 4 magnitudes in B and 2
magnitudes in I at z  1 see Fig 1 Thus it is crucial to determine accurately
the galaxy type The best is to use multi-color information the spectral con-
tinuum may also be used but sometimes cannot accurately constrain a type
depending on the rest-frame wavelength range observed and the spectral res-
olution Morphological information has also been used for local galaxies but
because of the miss- or non-classication of certain galaxies it is not as reli-
able as colors One way to minimize the k-correction is to use the relative
magnitude which spans the rest-frame band in which absolute magnitudes are
expressed For instance for galaxies around z 02 09 and 27 respectively
mV  mI and mH spans the rest-frame B band so the k-correction is small and
at these exact z the model-dependent term of the k-correction is null Also
k-correction can be directly measured from a ux-calibrated spectrum if the
observed wavelength range includes both the observed- and rest-frame bands
but this measure depends on the quality of the calibrated spectra The proper
determination of k-corrections has an impact on the accuracy of M and on the
measure of the observable volume of a galaxy used in the LF estimators
4 ESTIMATORS FOR THE LUMINOSITY FUNCTION
Several methods have been developed and generalized to estimate the comoving
number density as a function of luminosity ie the luminosity function LF
L or M  expressed as a number of galaxies per Jansky or per mag-
nitude per cubic megaparsec Table 1 summarizes the estimators that have

1 In practice the density is assumed constant in the range of redshifts in which
the LF is estimated
been used for a comprehensive review on estimators and history see 57 and
references within These estimators usually assume that the luminosity L is un-
correlated with spatial location r so that the comoving number density at a dis-
tance r as a function of luminosity can be written as L r  rr L
where r is the galaxy density function DF The assumed separability of LF
and DF means for instance that the LF is supposed to be the same in clusters
and in the eld which have dierent DF This assumption led to estimators
which are independent of the spatial galaxy distribution even though it is in-
homogeneous on small and large scales I emphasize now that correlations are
observed between galaxy properties and the neighborhood density The separa-
bility of L and r remains if the LF is calculated at a certain cosmic epoch with
estimators extended to be applied as a function of redshift Hence estimators
assume that L is uncorrelated to x y and changes only a little within a
small range of redshifts
Estimators for the LF dier mainly in how they evaluate the probability
of observing a galaxy with a luminosity L and type i in a given volume of
the universe The volume is usually dened by the low and high apparent
magnitude limits of a survey and by the redshift bin analysed giving a minimal
and maximal redshift Actually the SB and size limits should also be taken
into account if well-dened samples in SB and size are used These estimators
rely on the Bayes theorem which in this case says that in the absence of
prior information the most likely LF given the observations is the one which
would most often reproduce the observed distribution of galaxy luminosities in
a series of equally likely realizations Thus we maximize the joint probability
for the observables Usually this is done by maximizing the likelihood function
dened as logeL  loge Qi pLi  Pi pLi
Briey Vmax estimators are simply based on the inverse sum of the maximum
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
observable comoving volumes of each galaxy They assume a uniform density
and thus are aected by clustering in the galaxy distribution STY SWML and
 estimators cancel out in the calculations the density so they are clustering
insensitive methods The C method assumes a spherical density ie the LF
has the same shape at any x y so is ideal for pencil-beam rather than large-
angle surveys We note that all estimators can account for the completeness
function
Local surveys z 005 are strongly aected by the density uctuations of
the Virgo and Coma clusters in the North hemisphere and by a local void
in the South For example Willmer 57 compares dierent estimates of
the LF using the CfA1 redshift survey and nd large discrepancies caused
by the Virgo cluster which dominates this survey For slightly deeper local
surveys z 01 these discrepancies are much reduced The Vmax density-
dependent estimates give higher faint-end shape when the observed area is
cluster dominated but if the area is large and deep enough the eects of
clusters and voids are counter-balanced and the Vmax estimate is similar to
clustering insensitive estimates as seen in the 2dF 41 Distant surveys z 
01 which sample galaxies in pencil-beam elds of view do not suer from these
local inhomogeneities but their line of sight through cosmic epochs also crosses
structures and voids Observing several pencil-beams over the sky smoothes
this out and discrepancies between estimates are then small usually within
Poisson error bars
Even though methods do not assume a parametric function for L save
the STY method the shape of LFs are usually tted with a Schechter func-
tion ie LdL  LL expLLdLL where L represents a
characteristic luminosity above which the density of more luminous galaxies
decreases exponentially  is the slope of the LF at fainter luminosities called
the faint-end slope and  is the number density of galaxies at L called the
normalization In practice the number densities per magnitude are tted ie
M dM  04loge101004MM 1 exp1004M MdM  Thus
we say the slope is steep at or negative respectively when   10 0 or
0 The three Schechter parameters are highly correlated and thus redshift
surveys which sample a large range of luminosities are likely to give the best
results for the LF estimation It is of course a challenge to achieve this at any
redshift The mean galaxy density and mean luminosity density in a comoving
volume are respectively R LdL  1 and R LLdL  L2
The slope is measured   1 thus for a non-diverging density the LF must
have a cut-o at faint L This cut-o has not yet been observed even in the
deepest local survey ESP Since the slope is also measured  2 the numer-
ous faint L galaxies contribute little to the total luminosity density
Recently it appears that the Schechter function is not a good t to the over-
all LF over a wide luminosity range 37 52 58 A modied Schechter
function has been used as follows LdL  LL expLL1 
LL
t dLL where Lt is the luminosity at the transition between the
two power-laws This second power-law is introduced to t the overall LF from
L Tresse
all galaxies and in particular to allow the t to steepen at the faint luminosi-
ties The standard Schechter function does not reproduce the up-turn at the
faint-end since most weight in the ts comes from galaxies near M 
However if a Schechter function t is done for each individual galaxy type
and a nal overall t constructed from the sum of them this modied Schechter
function is not necessary since this sum provides the necessary degrees of free-
dom to allow a faint-end steepening In fact various types of galaxies have
very dierent LF the late types have a very steep slope with a faint M 
while early types have a negative slope with a luminous M  So the overall
LF should always be calculated as the sum of each individual population LF
ie L r  Psp spLsprspr where sp refers to a sub-population
These sub-populations can be dened for instance by colors surface bright-
ness morphological parameters morphology types bulgedisk ratios asym-
metrysymmetry sizes lumpiness degrees spectral parameters PCA types
line EWs SED types nucleus activity star-formation rates their environ-
ment etc For instance the overall LFs of the preliminary 2dF 18 and of
the LCRS 4 are well tted over the whole luminosity range in summing the
Schechter function ts of each individual PCA spectral type especially at the
faint end M bj5 log h  16 where the data show a genuine up-turn as in
the ESP LF On the contrary a Schechter function t for all galaxies does not
correctly reproduce the faint-end slope
In addition estimating the LF as the sum of type-dependant LFs avoids the
bad assumption that all galaxies are clustered in the same way Measuring
the LFs independently is the same as assuming the separability of L and r
within each individual population However it does not solve the problem if an
individual LF depends on density as hinted by the results in the LCRS 4
They nd that the faint-end slope steepens with local density for early-type
galaxies from   04  007 in high-density regions to 019  007 in low-
density regions The strength of such eects is likely to depend on the classier
chosen to dene the sub-populations
The last point is that methods which do not make any assumption about the
shape of DF  STY and SWML estimators recover only the shape of the
LF ie  and M  and so must normalize the LF in an independent manner
usually related to an independent maximum-likelihood estimator Step-wise
estimators calculate the normalization in each magnitude bins It is clear that
the faint-end LF reached by a survey is more uncertain due to the small volume
surveyed and so is more subject to density inhomogeneities
5 EVOLUTION OF LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS
A survey with a large baseline in redshift allows the estimation of the LF at
dierent epochs and hence allows the detection of evolution This requires
observing enough galaxies per bin of absolute magnitudes in each redshift bin
Although number count studies suggested evolution in the eld galaxy pop-
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
ulation it was controversial 29 14 and only recently has it been clearly
detected observationally CFRS LDSS CNOC2 Any changes in the LF with
redshift suggest evolution but care must be taken to account for incomplete-
nesses and biases and the signicance of any changes must be compared to the
estimated uncertainties Any theoretical interpretation of luminosity functions
depends very critically on an understanding of what is being measured and how
it is measured Parameterizing the LF with a Schechter function adds complex-
ity since the three parameters  L  are strongly correlated This makes
it dicult to disentangle evolution in density andor in luminosity Moreover
if pure density evolution is detected it is indistinguishable from density vari-
ations caused by large-scale structure to infer evolution we must assume that
the universe is homogeneous on very large scales see 53
Another critical point is that galaxy populations evolve dierently and aver-
aging over all galaxies can mask the evolution of each individual population As
seen in the previous Section sub-populations have very dierent LF The vari-
ous possible classiers are certainly related through star-formation history and
environmental eects and using several classiers will allow us to rene what
physically drives the evolution Only with large and deep surveys evolution can
be quantied for dierent galaxy populations Moreover selecting galaxies from
a single pass-band means that the set of observed galaxies varies with redshift
and can mimic an evolutionary trend Indeed any particular selection criteria
will favour a particular galaxy population Deep multi-color redshift surveys
will be better to quantify which set of galaxies is visible at dierent redshifts
Surface brightness functions are also needed to quantify which galaxies may
be missed because of a low or high surface brightness or included due to an
enhancement of star formation Studies of low surface-brightness galaxies show
that they are numerous even though they are not a major contributor to the
total luminosity density see for instance 47 52 37
Extreme care about the methodologies used should be taken when compar-
ing faint-end slope from dierent surveys a discrepancy can be mistaken for
evolution The best way to test for evolution is to look within the same survey
and use the same estimators for the comparison to avoid the possibles biases
discussed earlier in this lecture This point is even more important for LF
measured for a particular type of galaxies since any classication will be sub-
ject to the precise denition of the classier which may vary from a survey to
another one and to systematic variations in the classier as a function of red-
shift However to link local surveys to distant ones we always have to rely on
comparisons between dierent surveys Hence the importance of well-dened
surveys
6 STATUS
For 20 years redshift surveys have taken advantage of fast advances in technol-
ogy and instrumentation to become larger and deeper In the last few years the
L Tresse
study of galaxy evolution has undergone quite a revolution and is still moving
fast This has been possible thanks to the development of multi-object spec-
troscopy and large sensitive detectors on telescopes with good seeing It has
led to a much clearer picture The qualitative theoretical picture was already
in place but this has now been rened and quantied by the observational
constraints from recent redshift surveys Accurate measurements were crucial
to reach the stage where now we can denitely pick the most likely explana-
tions of galaxy evolution and rule out others that ourished earlier on For the
rst time we can trace observationally the global history of galaxy luminosity
density up to redshifts of z 5 39 The on-going and future redshift surveys
should represent a major step towards obtaining a detailed and rened picture
of this history As we saw to constrain better what drives evolution and how
galaxies form we need to classify galaxies consistently in each redshift bin We
also need to go deep and far thus large and deep well-dened redshift surveys
are required Table 2 gives the references of papers which estimate LFs and
Figure 2 displays some of them Below I give a non-exhaustive overview of the
current status of LFs
61 Local LFs
The local LF still presents questions for debate Indeed the discrepancies be-
tween various estimates are not yet fully explained However several come from
the methodologies and selection criteria used so that it is not straightforward
to compare the surveys A major issue has been the normalization of the lo-
cal LFs The latest overall LFs at z 01 of blue-selected surveys ESP CS
2dFs AF are about consistent with a fairly high normalization and positive
faint-end slope The LCRS diers for reasons that are still uncertain proba-
bly due to surface brightness cuts andor the selection of galaxies in the red
At larger depths z 03 the ESS AFLDSS-b agree also with an high nor-
malization However for less deep surveys z  005 large discrepancies up to
50 in the normalization estimate are found between SSRS2 CfA2 SAPM
and DurhamUKST surveys Multitude of explanations have been given in
the literature however none has been fully convincing just because it invokes
possible biases in each surveys that have not been fully quantied yet while
others invoke a local under-density in the southern hemisphere andor a rapid
evolution
The status for local LF estimates can be summarized as follows
a At z  01 signicant discrepancies are found between dierent surveys the
on-going 2dF and SDSS surveys should give more insights to this problem
b The LF of blue strongly star-forming late-type andor irregulars has a
steep faint-end slope   1 and faint M 
c The LF of red early-type or ES0 has a negative slope   1
d The LF of intermediate-type spirals has a at slope   0
e A faint end cut-o has been yet not observed at M bj5 log h  124
f LF of galaxies selected in the optical are steeper than those for a infrared

selection certainly due to dierent population sampled
g Late-type galaxy populations are fainter than early-type ones and more
numerous at the faint luminosities
h An up-turn at M bj5 log h  16 is genuily detected and is generally
related to the low-SB galaxies undergoing signicant star formation
i Very late-type galaxies are less clustered than early-type ones The strengh
of the dependency of the LF with the density for a single type remains to be
dened however early-type LF seems the most aected
These near-UV and blue rest-frame selected LF shapes reect the dominant
processes in each type of galaxy at low redshifts Massive galaxies are not
dominated by star bursts while it is for the faint galaxy population Since blue
selection is related to the number of ionizing stars a steep slope is expected for
actively star-forming galaxies dominated by short-time scale evolution see eg
L Tresse
Fig 2  LFs with z 005 top with z 01 middle and with z 02 see Table 2
The magnitude conversions are taken as quoted in the LF papers The LFs are signif-
icantly dierent between each survey due to the diverse methodologies adopted in the
selection of galaxies and in the measurements it emphasizes that the quantication of
the LF evolution is more securely understood within one single well-dened sample
23 Knowledge of the shape of these local LFs is crucial for future distant
LFs to see how each class evolves and which ones dominate the evolution at a
certain cosmic epoch Not discussed in this lecture are the K-selected redshift
surveys see 20 10 in this case nearby galaxies are selected on their mass
even more than with a R or I-selection
62 Distant LFs
The selection of galaxies in the red pass-band allowed for the rst time to probe
the evolution of galaxies up to z 1 CFRS see Fig 3 This was followed
by the larger CNOC2 survey which probes more nely the evolution for each
individual galaxy type up to z 06 In parallel the Autob team collected all
their B-selected surveys DARS AF-bright AF-faint BES LDSS1 LDSS2
and also demonstrate evolution in the eld population up to z 08
The present status is summarized below but note that when I write compat-

see 32 for more details q0  05 h  05 This survey demonstrated denitely the
galaxy population evolution from z 1 to today
ible it does not mean that this is the only explanation Indeed distinguishing
between density and luminosity function requires further analyses than solely
the LF studies The main conclusions are
a The overall LFs at z  05 show a normalization similar to that found at
z 0103
b Early-type LF has a negative slope and evolution is detected for galaxies
at M BAB5 log h  20 roughly compatible with luminosity evolution and
modest or no density evolution
c Intermediate-type LF has a slope almost at and evolution is detected at
about M BAB5 log h  20 compatible with luminosity evolution
d Late-type LF has a steep slope and evolution is detected in the steepening
of the slope compatible with modest luminosity evolution and strong density
evolution
f The faint-end slope at M BAB5 log h  18 is not yet observed at z  05
The picture of this dierential evolution will be quantied in detail in the near
future with larger and deeper surveys and several objective classication and
multi-color selection schemes The availability of a large well-dened databases
will precisely rene the evolution of each type of galaxy For instance we would

like to dierentiate between number density evolution and evolution in clus-
tering properties to relate morphological type spectral properties and environ-
ment to better constrain the faint-end LF slope at all redshifts for each type
of galaxies Figure 4 illustrates the Vmax estimates using HST eyeball mor-
phological types as tabulated in 3 we can see that the sample is barely large
enough to test for overall LF evolution split by morphological types However
the estimates around L do agree within the uncertainties with the summary
picture described above The absence of bright irregulars at z  05 is par-
ticularly noticeable if they exist they would certainly be visible This lack is
expected since the L of local late-type galaxies is much fainter than the other
types The picture at higher redshifts is signicantly dierent even allowing
for possible misclassication and is responsible for the strong evolution seen
LUMINOSITY FUNCTIONS AND EVOLUTION
in deep blue counts see 3 for a detailed discussion I note that signicant
discrepancies are likely to be found between dierent methods used to dene
or classify galaxies The acquisition of several colors and the development of
objective classications should be a great help to quantify the evolution of indi-
vidual population see eg lecture of Abraham for morphological classication
or 9 for spectral types
With this caveat these deep surveys have shown that the population which
exhibits the strongest LF evolution is composed of galaxies with strong emission
lines blue colors peculiar morphologies and relatively small sizes The LFs
for remaining population evolves mildly or passively mainly at L  L Their
faint-end slope is close to at which indicates moderate or little star-formation
activity The dierence in evolution for these two populations reects many
dierent processes in galaxy formation Some of the massive systems formed at
early epochs z  2 and then have a declining star formation rate giving the
redder galaxies consistent with passive evolution while other massive systems
still exhibit star formation at recent epochs Smaller systems that form later
z  1 are seen during their early phase of intense star formation Also
smaller gas-rich systems may merge at any z a short starburst phase during
the merger would contribute to the bright late-type galaxy LFs seen at z  05
where both irregular morphologies and high star-formation rate are seen A
starburst during initial collapse or during a merger has a very short timescale
and very quickly a stable phase is reached where the galaxy fades under passive
evolution Semi-analytical models and more recently N-body models which
incorporate star-formation prescriptions include all of these processes and are
giving insights into which are the most dominant processes in the formation
and evolution of galaxies and dark matter halos 25 1 For a discussion
on higher redshifts I refer to Dickinsons lecture and to 50 for the Hubble
Deep Field-North LFs at 1  z  4 These LFs are preliminary since they are
estimated with photometric redshifts and done on a single eld of view
7 CONCLUSION
Redshift survey analysis has been a crucial step forward in our understanding
of galaxy evolution We saw that all the steps in making a survey have their
importance and each step needs to be carefully considered and well-dened
The luminosity functions are essential to quantify the evolution for dierent
galaxy types Larger and deeper surveys are necessary to precise the dieren-
tial evolution of galaxy populations at all redshifts Local surveys will give a
rened and clearer picture at z  02 Future surveys on 8m class telescopes
equipped with new infrared capabilities will allow us to rene the evolution at
z  1 and systematic redshift surveys at z  1 will be enabled At the same
time deep redshift surveys in other wavelengths UV far-IR mm radio are
also crucial to link the dierent emissivities of the galaxy populations and to
observe epochs of formation of the rst stars These will be crucial to dieren-
