Abstract
We study the evolution of galaxy satellites with high resolution N-body simula-
tions Satellites are modeled as replicas of typical low and high surface brightness
galaxies LSBs and HSBs Encounters on high eccentricity orbits as typical in
hierarchical models of galaxy formation strip LSBs of most of their stars and tend
to decrease their surface brightness On the contrary bar instability in HSBs leads to
substantial loss of angular momentum of the stellar component and to an increase of
central surface brightness In both cases the remnant resembles a spheroidal galaxy
with an exponential surface brightness prole A simple modeling of color evolution
and interactions driven star formation gives ML ratios for the remnants that are
roughly consistent with observations These results suggest an evolutionary scenario
for the dwarf galaxies in our Local Group faint dSphs being the descendents of
LSBs and brighter dSphsdEs being the nal state of HSB satellites
1 Introduction
Our knowledge of the galaxies of the Local Group is becoming increas-
ingly detailed we have substantial information regarding star formation
histories kinematics and morphology of many faint dwarf satellites of
the Milky Way and Andromeda cf Mateo 1998 and references within
The Local Group shows a morphology density relation that re-
sembles that found in galaxy clusters Dressler et al 1998 Dwarf
irregulars dIrrs are found mainly in the far reaches of the Local Group
while dwarf spheroidals dSphs and dwarf ellipticals dSphsdEs are
abundant close to the primary galaxies
Detection of tidal streams in the halo of the Milky Way de Zeeuw
1998 and peculiar structure of some of its closest neighbors Ibata 
Lewis 1998 suggest that mutual interactions between galaxies have
played an important role in the evolution of all Local Group members
In this contribution we explore the eect that tidal interactions with
the primary galaxies could have on accreting disk-like satellites

2 Galaxy models
Galaxy models were built using the method developed by Hernquist
1993 We used observational constraints as well as theoretical models
of galaxy formation Cole et al 1999 to make credible replicas of
real galaxy satellites Parameters for disk and halo components were
chosen to represent typical HSB and LSB dwarf galaxies We start by
choosing a circular velocity Vc  75 kms comparable to that of
large companions of spiral galaxies Zaritsky et al 1993 such as the
LMC or NGC205 in our Local Group The virial mass of the satellite
is then determined by the circular velocity and is weakly dependent
on cosmology White  Frenk 1991 we assumed a CDM model with
  1 and h  05
HSBs and LSBs obey the same B-band Tully Fisher relation on a
large range of circular velocities Zwaan et al 1997 using this last
relation we derive a value for the disk luminosity LB  2  109L
We assign the same disk mass to both HSBs and LSBs by assuming
MLB  2 as suggested by the generalized Bottema model de Blok
 McGaugh 1997 Disks are constructed using a Toomre parameter
Q  2 this being a necessary condition for global stability against bar
modes Friedli these proceedings The HSB disks have an exponential
scale-length rh  2 kpc while we use rh  5 kpc for LSB disks these
values are consistent with the observed Vc  rh relation Zwaan et al
1997 and give a surface brightness 0  22 mag arcsec2 for the HSB
satellite and 0  24 mag arcsec2 for the LSB satellite This is in
good agreement with average values found in the samples of de Blok 
McGaugh 1997 Each galaxy model is embedded in an isothermal halo
truncated at the virial radius the same for both models as it depends
only on Vc  the halo is 60 times more massive than the disk and has
a core radius rc equal to rh Due to its larger core the LSB model has
a low-concentration halo and thus a slowly rising rotation curve while
the HSB satellite has a 3 times more concentrated halo and a steeply
rising rotation curve consistent with observations de Blok  McGaugh
1997 see Fig1 MtotalMdisk at the optical radius Ropt  3rh see
Persic and Salucci 1997 is equal to 4 for the HSB and is over 10 for the
LSB satellite We used about 200000 particles for the halo and 50000
particles for the disk of each satellite model
Halo particles that pass through the disk are less massive and hence
proportionally more numerous than halo particles whose orbits do not
intersect the disk This reduces disk heating due to two-body scattering
by heavier halo particles Lacey  Ostriker 1985 Velasquez  White
1998 The softenings are set to 006rh for the disk 04rh for the lo-res
halo particles and 035rh for the hi-res ones The models were evolved in
isolation for more than 5 Gyr to test their stability At a xed particle
number we veried that disk heating is reduced by a factor of about 2
using a variable resolution model for the satellites halos
The primary galaxy is modeled as a Milky-Way sized isothermal halo
Vc  220 kms truncated at the virial radius and whose mass is then
30 times larger than that of the satellites It is represented by either a
50000 particles N-Body realization or simply by an external potential
This last conguration is preferable as it avoids numerical disk heating
due to two-body scattering by massive particles belonging to the pri-
mary halo Dynamical friction can be safely neglected because of the
small mass of the satellites and the further delay resulting from tidal
stripping Colpi et al in preparation Our results are independent of
the type of halo actually used
3 Initial Conditions
We perform all of our simulations with the parallel treecode PKDGRAV
Stadel et al in preparation which has multistepping capabilities and
uses local acceleration for the assignment of individual timesteps to
particles The minimum allowed timestep is  5  105yr Force calcu-
lations are done using a multipole expansion up to hexadecapole terms
with a tolerance parameter   07 The satellite is put on a bound
and very eccentric orbit with apoperi  10 or 4 with an apocenter
close to the virial radius of the primary system consistent with the
satellite just being accreted Orbits of this kind are the most common
for satellite halos in cosmological N-Body simulations Ghigna et al
1998 We run simulations with dierent relative orientations of the
orbital angular momentum and spin of the satellite from pure pro-
grade encounters vectors are parallel to pure retrograde encounters
vectors are antiparallel Several numerical tests ie varying timestep
tolerance and running identical ic with the TREECODEV3 by Barnes
 Hernquist were performed to ensure that results do not depend on
the code or the particular choice of numerical parameters
4 Results
HSBs and LSBs lose most of their dark matter halo after a few orbital
periods of typically 2 Gyr The ratio MtotalMstars at the initial Ropt
has decreased to 154 after t  7 Gyr see Fig1 LSBs are structurally
very fragile compared to HSBs they end up with the smallest halos
and lose up to 90 of their stellar mass decreasing their total mass to

 108M Instead HSBs lose no more than 40 of their stellar mass
and have nal total masses in excess of 109M The dierent response
of the satellites is due primarily to the potential depth of the mass
distribution and the disk scale-lengths eg Moore 1999 A stellar bar
appears after the rst pericentric passage its pattern being particularly
strong for HSBs as a consequence of the higher disk surface density
Mihos et al 1997 This leads to substantial angular momentum loss
for HSBs disk particles see Fig2 The evolution of the satellites de-
pends on the orbital parameters and diskorbit orientation as well
Encounters on the more eccentric orbits are more damaging because
the tidal eld is stronger at small pericenters Prograde encounters are
a lot more destructive compared to retrograde ones Toomre  Toomre
1972 Barnes 1988 Large tidal tails appear only in prograde encounters
due to an approximate resonance between internal and orbital motions
Springel  White 1998 and their extension is considerably larger in
LSB galaxies because of their shallower halo density prole and larger
disk scale-length Fig 2
Stellar streams form which trace the orbital path of the satellite
their patterns are long lived Tidal interactions have a profound in-
uence on the morphology of the satellites that evolve from disks to
spheroids the degree of attening of the remnants varies from case to
case depending also on the diskorbital plane orientation The stellar
remnants have nal tidal radii in the range 6  10 kpc If we measure
D25 ie the radius containing a surface brightness higher than 25 mag
arcsec2 the size of our remnants would never exceed 3  4 kpc see
Fig1 Remnants of LSBs could even be missed by some optical surveys
Remarkably the projected density prole of the satellites steepens but
remains close to exponential with nal scale lengths smaller than the
initial ones The central surface brightness increases by up to 1 mag
arcsec2 for HSBs due to the angular momentum loss while it can de-
crease by about the same amount for LSBs on the most eccentric orbits
see Fig1 The central dispersion behavior seems to follow that of the
central surface density increasing remarkably for HSB galaxies coarse
grained phase space density decreases eg Hernquist et al 1993 The
nal values are comparable with those observed in early-type dwarfs in
our Local Group 10  30 kms
To derive mass-to-light ratios of the satellites to be compared with
current observations we have included a simple description of the evolu-
tion of the stellar component in an LSB satellite using stellar population
synthesis models by Bruzual  Charlot 1993 with a Kennicutt IMF
Kennicutt 1994 and assuming a metallicity Z  13Z as typically
inferred for LSBs Gerritsen  de Blok 1999 We suppose the galaxy
to form at z  2 and enter the virial radius of the primary at z  1
ie after 2 Gyr in our assumed cosmology
Its star formation history is divided in three distinct phases during
the rst 2 Gyr we assume an exponentially declining star formation
rate SFR with a large time constant   10 Gyr and an amplitude
of 02Myr as suggested by observations and numerical simulations
Gerritsen  de Blok 1999 The satellite enters the primary with the
mass and luminosity of our N-Body model It then undergoes a central
burst after the rst pericentric passage at t  4 Gyr as a consequence
of bar formation and induced gas inow eg Lake et al 1998 Finally
we assume star formation to be truncated due to ram pressure and tidal
stripping of gas leading to passive evolution until the present time The
SFR during the burst has amplitudes going from 1 to  5Myr and
a duration of 50 Myr as observed in blue star forming LSBs a larger
T Gyr

satellites Only particles that end up in the remnant are shown
burst would be quite inconsistent with the low gas density and weak
bar instability expected in an LSB galaxy
At the present time the stellar mass-to-light ratio in the B band has
a lower limit of  7 Fig 2 A higher value of the order of 11  12
is obtained using solar metallicity or smaller bursts However dSphs
have usually metallicity well less than solar Grebel 1998
Including the dark matter contribution the nal central mass-to-
light ratio of our LSB satellites is at least 1015 However mass-to-light
ratios in dSphs are based on measures of the line-of-sight velocity
dispersion from which the central density is inferred The remnants
of LSBs have extended tails that can project along the line of sight
we nd that we can overestimate the central dispersion by a factor
of  2 due to velocity gradients in the tails Platek  Pryor 1995
Thus including also tidal eects we would measure central mass-to-
light ratios in the range 10  40 for the remnants of LSB satellites
similar values are found for many dSphs like Leo I or Sagittarius A
Mateo 1998 Higher values  50 are necessary to match those of
Draco and Ursa Minor HSBs on the contrary are less aected by tides
the line-of-sight velocity dispersions are high at the end  30 kms
but reect the velocity dispersion expected from virial equilibrium
Low total mass-to-light ratios of the order of 2  6 are inferred for
dSphsdEs like NGC205 Mateo 1998 These are close to the values
we obtain for MtotalMstars in the remnants of HSBs Thus if we want
these satellites to be ancestors of the brightest spheroidals we need to
suppose a more prolonged star formation to maintain low stellar mass-
to-light ratios Regions of recent star formation do exist in dSphsdEs
Grebel 1998
5 Conclusions
This work shows that the long-lived interaction between a satellite and
the primary galaxy can drive a dramatic morphological transformation
between dwarf spirals to spheroidals After 2-3 pericenter passages LSB
disk satellites resemble currently observed dSphs galaxies see Mateo
1998 HSBs instead become more centrally concentrated and are
likely the ancestors of more luminous dwarf ellipticals dSphsdEs
The increase in concentration is related to an interaction driven bar-
instability which causes stars to lose substantial angular momentum
The end products of interactions have lost plenty of dark matter
during their evolution Stars are no more a secondary mass component
at the end especially in the case of LSBs However a combination
of fading of the stellar component and inated velocity dispersions
due to projection of tidal tails can produce ML as high as those of
many dSphs in the Local Group Mateo 1998 while Draco and Ursa
Minor need further investigation A more prolonged star formation is
requested to explain the observed ML ratios of brighter dSphsdEs
Its tempting to associate our suggested picture for the evolution of
galaxy satellites with the observed population of blue-compact galax-
ies at intermediate and high-redshift Guzman et al 1997 We pro-
pose that those galaxies are disk-satellites undergoing morphological
evolution and interaction induced star formation
Moore et al 1998 1999 has shown that fast encounters between
galaxies in clusters galaxy harassment can drive their morpholog-
ical evolution from disks to spheroids This work shows that a similar
scenario applies for large galaxy satellites in a regime where the ratio
of relativeinternal velocities is smaller These results combine to show
that tidal interactions provide a general all purpose mechanism to
evolve galaxies along the Hubble sequence This is an alternative to
the classic merger scenario and is likely to occur in a large variety of
environments throughout the history of the Universe
