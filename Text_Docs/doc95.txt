Abstract  Stemming  is  the  process  of  extracting 
root  word  from  the  given  inflection  word  It  also  plays 
significant  role 
in  numerous  application  of  Natural 
Language  Processing  NLP  The  stemming  problem  has 
addressed  in  many  contexts  and  by  researchers  in  many 
disciplines  This expository paper presents survey of some 
of the latest developments on stemming algorithms in data 
mining  and  also  presents  with  some  of  the  solutions  for 
various Indian language stemming algorithms along  with 
the results  
Keywords Tamil morphology Tamil stemmer Light stemmer

INTRODUCTION 
 A literature review is a description of the study relevant to 
particular field or topic It is discusses about the information 
in a particular subject area for the past years The process of 
reading  analyzing  evaluating  and  summarizing  materials 
about  specific  topic  are  called  Data  Mining  DM  Text 
Mining TM Stemming and Clustering The review describes 
summaries  evaluate  and  clarify  various  applications  of 
clustering in different disciplines This demonstrates that the 
knowledge  has  been  gained  in  the  required  area  and  got 
awareness on the relevant theories 
I  STEMMING A REVIEW 
Alkula R proposed plain character strings to meaningful 
words 1 in 2001 It is capable of improving the Information 
Retrieval  System  IRS  using  conversion  of  the  plain  text 
character  strings  to  meaningful  words  KrovetzR  viewed 
morphology as an inference process 2 in 1993 This research 
projected an inference process used in IRS  In 2002 Nilsson 
introduced hierarchical clustering using non-greedy  principal 
direction  divisive  partitioning  for  partitioning  algorithm  is 
applied  to  number  of  clusters  and  it  is  based  on  the  non-
greedy  principal  Popovic  M  and  WilletP  presented  the 
effectiveness  of  stemming  for  natural-language  access  to 
Slovene textual data 4 in 1992 It is also used to improve the 
stemming  accuracy  in  Slovenes  texts  In  1999  SavoyJ 
developed  a  stemming  procedure  and  stop  word  list  for 
general French corpora 5 for stems the French corpora using 
stop word list generation rule 
In  the  year  of  1995  KalamboukisTZ  developed 
suffix stripping with Modern Greek 6 In this research Greek 
language words are stemmed by suffix stripping algorithm In 
1999 Abu-Salem H Al-Omari M and Evens MW applied 
Stemming methodologies over individual query words for an 
Arabic information retrieval system 7 In the  year of 2003 
RosellM  developed 
improving  clustering  of  Swedish 
newspaper  articles  using  stemming  and  compound  splitting 
8  Morphological  typology  of  languages  for  information 
retrieval 9 was invented by PirkolaA In this research IRS 
retrieves 
the  morphological 
typology In the year 1996 HullD was developed stemming 
algorithms  case  study  for  detailed  evaluation  10  for 
evaluating their performance 
information  based  on 
II  STEMMERS FOR INDIAN LANGUAGES A REVIEW 
In  2001  Shambhavi  et  al  introduced  Kannada 
morphology  analyzer  and  generator  and  using  tire  11  A 
lightweight  stemmer  for  Hindi  12  was  developed  by 
Ramanathan  et al in the year of 2004 In this research words 
conflate  terms  by  suffix  removal  for  information  retrieval 
WilletP  proposed 
the  porter  stemming  algorithm  for 
electronic  library  and  information  system  13  in  2006 
ZahurulMD  et  al  developed  a  lightweight  stemmer  for 
Bengali  14  in the  year  of  2009  for  Bengali  language  spell 
checker  Assas-band  an  affix-exception  list  based  Urdu 
stemmer 15 was developed by Qurat-Ul-Ain Akram and et 
al in the year of 2009 It stems the Urdu words using lexical 
lookup  method  Assas-band  In  2010  Dinesh  Kumar  and 
Prince  Rana  developed  design  and  development  of  stemmer 
for Punjabi 16 it uses Brute Force algorithm for stemming 
the Punjabi words  
Vijay Sundar et al introduced Malayalam stemmer for 
information retrieval 17 in the year of 2010 Finite State 
Automata method is used to stem the Malayalam words

Marathi  word  in  Knowledge  Discovery  Databases  KDD 
Named  entity  in  Telugu  language  using  language  dependent 
feature  and  rule  based  approach  20  was  developed  by 
SridharB et al in the year of 2011 The proposed model uses 
the  Named  Entity  Recognition  NER  for  stemming  the 
Telugu  words  Juhi  Ameta  et  al  introduced  a  lightweight 
stemmer for Gujarati 21 in the year of 2012 In this proposed 
model  the  lightweight  stemmer  algorithm  for  stems  the 
Gujarati  words  MAULIK  An  efficient  stemmer  for  Hindi 
22  Language  was  developed  by  Upendra  Mishra  et  al 
MAULIK algorithm is used to stem the Hindi words In 2012 
an  iterative  stemmer  for  Tamil  Language  was  proposed  by 
Vivekanandan  Ramachandran  et  al  in  this  proposed  model 
suffix  stripper  algorithm  is  used  to  stem  Tamil  words  to  its 
root  word  The  finding  of  the  above  literature  survey  is 
tabulated in Table I 
III CONCLUSION 
Stemming  plays  a  vital  role  in  information  retrieval 
system and its effect is very large compared to that found in 
review on various stemming algorithms In this paper we have 
studied  about  various 
effectiveness  on  various  Indian  languages  This  is  not  quite 
enough  for  information  retrieval  system  So  that  in  future 
researchers will go for more number of implementations for 
the stemming algorithm methods and their utilities for various 
Indian languages information retrieval system 
stemming  algorithms  and
