Receptors of bacterial chemotaxis form clusters at the cell poles where clusters act as antennas
to amplify small changes in ligand concentration Interestingly chemoreceptors cluster at multiple
length scales At the smallest scale receptors form dimers which assemble into stable timers of
dimers At a large scale trimers form large polar clusters composed of thousands of receptors
Although much is known about the signaling properties emerging from receptor clusters
unknown how receptors localize at the cell poles and what the cluster-size determining factors
are Here we present a model of polar receptor clustering based on coupled trimers of dimers
where cluster size is determined as a minimum of the cluster-membrane free energy This energy
has contributions from the cluster-membrane elastic energy penalizing large clusters due to their
high intrinsic curvature and receptor-receptor coupling favoring large clusters We nd that the
reduced cluster-membrane curvature mismatch at the curved cell poles leads to large and robust
polar clusters in line with experimental observation while lateral clusters are eciently suppressed

INTRODUCTION
Chemoreceptor clustering is widely conserved among
bacteria and archaea 1 allowing cells to detect chemi-
cals in the environment with high sensitivity over a wide
range of background concentrations In the bacteria Es-
cherichia coli Salmonella enterica and Caulobacter cres-
centus receptor clustering is well documented and occurs
at multiple length scales At a small scale chemotaxis
receptors form stable homodimers which then assemble
into larger complexes with receptors of dierent chemi-
cal specicities intermixed 2 Three homodimers con-
nected at their signaling tip form a trimer of dimers
named trimer from here on 2 3 4 believed to be the
smallest stable signaling unit 5 6 At a larger scale
thousands of receptors 7 form approximately 200-nm
large polar clusters cf Fig 1a 3 12 13 14 15 16
Despite the excellent characterization of much of the bac-
terial chemotaxis network it is unknown how receptors
localize at the cell poles and how they assemble into large
polar clusters
Polar localization appears to be an intrinsic property
of chemoreceptors 17 18 It hardly depends on the pres-
ence or absence of the receptor-bound kinase CheA and
adapter protein CheW 19 and is unaected by removal
of the periplasmic ligand-binding domain of the receptors
19 It is also a passive process since newly synthesized
receptors initially inserted at random positions in the
membrane diuse and ultimately become trapped at the
cell poles 20 21 Most importantly polar localization
appears to depend on membrane curvature First in-
hibition of actin-homologue MreB in growing cells leads
to cell swelling and a diuse receptor distribution with
remaining receptor localization in areas of increased cell
curvature 22 Second receptor-membrane extracts self-
assemble into round micelles after receptor overexpres-
sion and cell lysis 23 Fig 1b From electron micro-
graphs the intrinsic curvature of the trimer structure can
be estimated 24 Third other two-component receptor
dimers eg the receptor LuxQ of the quorum-sensing
pathway dimerize without forming trimers of dimers and
are evenly distributed over the cell surface 25 Taken to-
gether these observations suggest that the distinct trimer
structure with its increased intrinsic curvature is respon-
sible for polar receptor localization
While trimers may have a tendency to localize at
the cell poles and areas of high membrane curvature
tight clustering requires an attractive coupling among
the trimers The conventional view is that CheA and
CheW mediate interactions among receptors Alterna-
tive models include swapping of the cytoplasmic recep-
tor domains 26 and membrane-mediated coupling 27
see Results and Discussion section The high sensitiv-
ity and cooperativity obtained from in vivo FRET uo-
rescence resonance energy transfer 28 29 and in vitro
30 data demonstrate that the functional units of recep-
tor signaling are indeed larger than trimers These ob-
servations are supported by recent quantitative models
29 31 32 33 34 35
Based on these observations we propose a model for
polar receptor localization and clustering due to the high
intrinsic curvature of trimers and an attractive trimer-
trimer coupling Specically we consider a membrane-
embedded cluster composed of trimers For a sphero-
cylindrical cell we assume that the average membrane
curvature at the poles is twice as large as average cur-
vature at the lateral surface area and that trimers have
a high intrinsic curvature Fig 2a The intrinsic cur-
vature of a trimer tends to deform the membrane Fig
2c penalizing large clusters of trimers However at-
tractive coupling between trimers favors cluster forma-
leading to a competition between these two op-

posing energy contributions Using continuum elastic
theory we derive an analytical expression for the to-
tal cluster-membrane energy We nd that due to the
reduced cluster-membrane curvature mismatch at the
poles trimers favorably cluster at the poles and not at
the lateral cell area Furthermore the cluster-size distri-
bution is determined by the cluster-membrane energetics
as well as the trimer density in the cell membrane Our
predicted average cluster size is in line with experimental
observation
II MODEL
Receptor geometry
In our model receptor dimers are assumed to always
be associated in trimers the smallest stable signaling
unit 5 6
In Fig 2a the receptor dimer length and
width as well as the distance between neighboring
dimers within a trimer are taken from partial crystal
structures 4 and electron microscopy 23 Very similar
parameters were used to model the physical response
of trimers to osmolytes measured by homo-FRET 36
Importantly the estimated value for the intrinsic curva-
ture of a trimer corresponds closely to the inverse radius
of self-assembled micelles Fig 1b 23 The value for
the trimer cross section A table I is consistent with a
three-dimensional model of the receptor cluster 37 38
and estimates from cryo-electron microscopy 8 13 23
Elastic cluster-membrane energy
The elastic energy of a membrane-embedded cluster is
determined by cluster and membrane bending energies
The rst term proportional to the bending stiness c
of the receptor cluster penalizes deviations between the
total cluster curvature 2 Cc and the preferred cluster cur-
vature which is equal to the intrinsic trimer curvature
CT  The total cluster curvature 2 Cc  C1  C2 is dened
by the two principal curvatures C1 and C2 39 The sec-
ond term in Eq 1 proportional to the pinning modulus
 40 41 penalizes deviations of the cluster height hc
from the preferred height h0 determined by the shape of
the curved cell wall The third and forth terms in Eq 1
mirror the rst and second respectively and describe the
cluster-surrounding membrane with total curvature 2 Cm
preferred curvature Cm and height hm Bending sti-
nesses c and m arise from optimal packing of receptors
and lipids respectively aiming to protect hydrophobic
residues from polar water The pinning modulus arises
due to the turgor pressure which pushes the membrane
and cluster outward while the rigid cell wall pushes them
inward The net eect is a penalty for deformations away
from the preferred cell shape see Fig 2 40 41
Let us dene the relative height perturbation hcm 
hcmr  h0r as measured relative to the preferred
height h0r in the direction of the normal pointing in
the radial direction outward from surface h0r Fig
2 bc This allows us to perform the following cal-
culations in the so-called normal gauge where the to-
tal curvatures for the cluster and membrane 2 Ccm

Parameter C is the important curvature mismatch ie
the dierence between the cluster and membrane curva-
tures The elastic energy model in Eq 2 neglects sur-
face tension as well as an Gaussian curvature eect due
to the dierent cluster and membrane elastic properties
see Appendix A for a justication In this paper the
model is applied to both polar and lateral clusters using
standard parameter values given in table I Very similar
models were previously applied to describe mixtures of
lipids with dierent curvatures 40 41 43 44 45 For a

Considering a circular cluster of radius R the total
height prole hr  hx y is composed of hcr for the
cluster r  R and hmr for the membrane r  R
and is determined by minimizing the total elastic cluster-

cated at the origin of the coordinate system we ap-
ply cylindrical symmetry from now on To solve Eq
6 for cluster and membrane one needs four boundary
conditions for each equation We require hcr  0
at the origin and that the membrane deformation van-
ishes far away from the cluster ie
limr hmr  0
and limr hmrr  0 We further impose that
the solutions for cluster and membrane match at the

ied Bessel functions of the rst and second kind respec-
tively
To construct the solution for the cluster r  R only
the modied Bessel function of the rst kind has zero
slope at r  0 whereas to construct the solution for
the membrane r  R only the modied Bessel function
of the second kind has a vanishing real part at innity
To obtain real solutions we need to add their complex
conjugates
which is independent of C in the small deformation

In our model trimers interact favorably when in close
contact driving cluster formation The total coupling

For a triangular lattice used in Fig 3 we consider the

formed around a central trimer the coupling energy is
given by 41

Conditions for large polar clusters
To nd the conditions which favor polar clustering we
consider the total energy density   EplN  ie the to-
tal energy of the membrane-embedded cluster per trimer
Generally minimization with respect to N determines
the energetically preferred cluster size We note the fol-
lowing First the energy density is generally a mono-
tonically decreasing function of N  which eventually sat-
urates for large N cf Fig 5a This indicates that
maximal cluster sizes are energetically favorable Sec-
ond the elastic energy density is always smaller at the
poles than at the lateral area demonstrating that polar
clustering is energetically predominant

III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Based on experimental observations outlined in the In-
troduction section we propose a model for polar recep-
tor localization and clustering Fig 2 The ingredients
and model assumptions are as follows 1 An individ-
ual trimer of dimers trimer believed to be the smallest
stable signaling unit 5 6 has a high intrinsic curva-
ture CT Fig 2a The cell membrane has a higher
curvature at the cell poles Cmp than at the lateral area
Cml For a sphero-cylindrical cell we have specically
Cml  Cmp2 Since CT  Cmp  Cml individual
trimers favor the cell poles energetically although this
eect is very small by itself fraction of thermal energy
kBT  2 Trimers are coupled with strength J0 when in
close proximity Fig 2bc driving cluster formation at
the poles and lateral area Fig 3 3 Due to the cluster-
membrane curvature mismatch growing clusters deform
the membrane and are energetically penalized However
since the cluster-membrane curvature mismatch at the
poles Cp  CT  Cmp is smaller than the correspond-
ing mismatch at the lateral area Cl  CT  Cmp2
this energy penalty is reduced at the poles Fig 2b As
outlined in the Model section the model is implemented
by considering a membrane-embedded cluster of radius
R The height prole of the cluster and the membrane
minimizes the elastic energy which is determined by the
cluster and membrane preferred curvatures respective

CT and Cmpl and their bending stinesses respective
c and m Furthermore a pinning modulus  40 41
pushes the membrane and the cluster against the rigid
cell wall Fig 2 bc This penalizes large deformations of
the cluster and the membrane The main ndings are as
follows 1 Considered separately poles and lateral area
favor maximal cluster sizes energetically 2 Actual clus-
ter size is determined by timer density entropy where
increasing trimer density pushes distribution of cluster
sizes to larger values 3 Polar-only clustering is a result
of the reduced curvature mismatch at the poles energet-
ically stabilizing polar clusters and suppressing lateral
ones Our results are in line with the experimental ob-
servation of large polar clusters which were found to be
robust 17 18 19 and only slightly aected by attractant

Fig 4 shows typical cluster-membrane height proles
for two dierent cluster radii R10 and 100 nms The
height prole minimizes the cluster-membrane elastic en-
ergy given in Eq 2 The prole of the small cluster
bulges out into the periplasmic space in a convex man-
ner while the large cluster of physiological size is at-
tened The latter eect appears consistent with images
from cryo-electron microscopy 12 13

tial left inset in Fig 4b Signicant reduction of the

How large are clusters and how do their sizes dier
between cell poles and lateral positions Consider a
membrane-embedded cluster of radius R or number of
trimers N  R2A where A is the trimer cross section
The total trimer energy E is equal to the sum of the un-
favorable elastic energy Eel and the favorable attractive
energy Ea Dividing by the number of trimers N results
in the corresponding energy densities  el and a Gen-
erally the minimum of the total energy density  as a
function of cluster size N provides the preferred cluster
size Fig 5a shows that key requirements for stable po-
lar clusters are fullled 1 The energy density reaches
its lowest value in the limit N   energetically favor-
ing maximal clusters 2 Although the energy-density
dierence  between the poles and lateral cell area can
be smaller than the thermal energy kBT  a cluster of N
trimers is stabilized at the poles and suppressed at the
lateral area when N  is larger than kBT see Model
section
Due to the nite trimer density cluster sizes are al-
ways nite To obtain the predicted distribution of clus-
ter sizes we consider the combined system of cell poles
and lateral area The distribution of cluster sizes can
be calculated using Boltzmann statistics of equilibrium
statistical mechanics see Model section A chemical
potential is further adjusted to obtain a certain target
trimer density Fig 5b shows the size distributions of
polar and lateral clusters for three dierent trimer den-
sities Even at low trimer densities very few residual
trimers stabilized by entropy remain unclustered at the
poles and lateral area The average radii of polar clusters
shown in Fig 5c correspond well with the observed clus-
ter diameters of about 200 nm whereas lateral clusters
are signicantly suppressed
As shown in Fig 5c our model predicts the aver-
age cluster size as function of trimer density This pre-
diction can experimentally be tested through imaging
The uorescence intensity of a cluster eg measured
using receptor-GFP fusion proteins 20 is proportional
to the number of receptors in the cluster Alternatively
imaging by cryo-electron microscopy can provide spatial
cluster dimensions 12 13 The dependence on trimer
density can be studied by expressing receptors from an
inducible plasmid An recent experiment using the fusion
protein CheY-YFP as a uorescent marker indeed indi-
cated a strong correlation between receptor expression
level and polar uorescence intensity 62 Furthermore
the predicted link between membrane curvature and clus-
tering can be tested by quantifying receptor-uorescence
intensities for cell-shape phenotypes eg when inhibit-
ing actin-homologue MreB 20 responsible for rod shape
in bacteria Alternatively cocci cells or round membrane
vesicles can be used allowing the study of receptor clus-
tering in presence of only a single membrane curvature
In Fig 6 we show the predicted average cluster size as
a function of coccus radius and receptor density expres-
sion level
Increasing the coccus radius decreases the
coccus curvature and leads to a larger cluster-membrane
curvature mismatch which reduces cluster size In con-
trast increasing the receptor density shifts cluster size
distribution toward larger clusters
In recent experiments the physical response of dimers
were measured by homo-FRET using receptor-YFP fu-
sions 36 63 These data indicate that the dimer-
dimer distance in a trimer distance between receptor
C-termini shrinks by 10 upon osmolyte stimulation
Osmolytes act as repellents and are presumably sensed
through receptor-membrane coupling To see if polar
clustering is robust against such perturbations Fig 5c
shows that a 10 increase of the dimer-dimer distance

these parameter variations only lead to modest changes
in cluster stability blue and red error bars respectively
While our model provides a robust mechanism for the
formation of large polar clusters there are limitations of
the model 1 A recent study showed that in addition to
large polar clusters there are also small lateral clusters
at future division sites such as 12 as well as 14 and
34 cell length 14 However these lateral clusters ap-
pear immobile presumably due to anchoring and hence
may form through a dierent mechanism In Rhodobac-
ter sphaeroides immobile lateral clusters of chemotaxis
receptor homologues were even found in the cytoplasm
64 Our model does suggest cluster formation at the
new poles once cell division occurs and the membrane
pinches o Newly synthesized receptors inserted by
the Sec-machinery throughout the cell surface 20 65
would begin to cluster at the new cell poles However
if equilibration is too slow to grow new polar clusters
from scratch after cell division lateral clusters may be
useful by serving as nucleation sites 2 Structural work
on receptors and receptor-bound proteins in Thermotoga
maritima suggests that at least for this bacterium re-
ceptor dimers may assemble into linear oligomers and
not trimer-based clusters 66 A bioinformatics study
on chemotaxis receptors across many species also ad-
dresses this issue but does not favor one model over the
other 67 On the other hand cryo-electron microscopy
of Caulobacter crescentus strongly supports trimer-based
clusters 13 3 Our model does not include interactions
between multiple clusters Such interactions may largely
be unimportant since uorescence images generally in-
dicate only one rarely more clusters per cell pole 14
4 It can further not be ruled out that receptors do not
localize to the poles themselves but that certain polar
lipids eg cardiolipin 68 provide favorable sites for
receptor localization and clustering 5 Although some
elastic properties are included in our model others are
not eg membrane thickness deformation due to large
hydrophobic transmembrane domains 49 Thickness de-
formation leads to a line tension ie an elastic energy
proportional to the cluster circumference 2R aecting
both polar as well as lateral clusters equally While this
eect does not change the stability of polar clusters the
line tension may provide a mechanism for trimer-trimer
coupling 69 see next paragraph and have inuence on
the cluster size distribution
What are the possible mechanisms responsible for
trimer-trimer coupling 1 Coupling mediated by CheA
and CheW Fig 3 inset Presence of CheA and CheW
increases polar clustering only modestly 15 16 59
However overexpression of CheA decreases whereas
overexpression of CheW increases the receptor cooper-
ativity measured by FRET 29
2 Coupling medi-
ated by elastic membrane deformations Receptor ac-
tivity has been shown to depend on receptor-membrane
interactions 36 63 70 which we speculate may pro-
vide a mechanism for trimer-trimer coupling 69 71 In
support of this mechanism receptor transmembrane re-
gions are unusually large 24 to 30 residues compared
to the membrane thickness 30A or about 20 residues
72 Such large regions possibly lead to signicant mem-
brane deformations to protect the hydrophobic receptor
residues from water Fig 3 inset If transmembrane re-
gions change with activity eg within the receptor piston
model 70 73 74 75 trimer-trimer coupling may even
depend on the receptor activity state as proposed for
the approximate two-state osmolarity-sensing MscL pore
27 3 Coupling mediated by swapping of cytoplasmic
domains of neighboring dimers 26
Many other sensory receptors cluster as well including
B-cell 76 T-cell 77 Fc 78 synaptic 79 and ryan-
odine 80 receptors This indicates that receptor cluster-
ing is an important regulatory mechanism of the cell eg
to adjust signaling properties recruit auxiliary proteins
or kinetically proof-read unexpected stimuli Unlike bac-
teria eukaryotic receptor clustering appears much more
dynamic including receptor diusion and internalization
and the underlying physical mechanism remain little un-
derstood Our work adds additional support to the idea
that the elastic properties of receptors and membrane
may be a general design principle to regulate receptor
localization and clustering 47 81
APPENDIX A SURFACE TENSION AND
GAUSSIAN CURVATURE
The elastic energy in Eq 2 neglects surface tension
and Gaussian curvature terms Here we show that these
two elastic energy contributions are indeed very small
Surface tension
In the small deformation approximation Monge repre-
sentation for cluster and membrane the contribution
from the surface tension to the elastic energy Eq 2 is
given by
hc2d2r 
hm2d2r
where cm is the surface tension of the cluster mem-
brane and   x y Surface tension arises
in part from the attractive receptor-receptor and lipid-
lipid interactions Minimization of the total elastic en-
ergy Eq 2 plus Eq A1 leads to the Euler-Lagrange
equation
4hcmr 
2hcmr 
hcmr  0
for the cluster membrane Using integration-by-parts
twice 49 53 and Eq A2 the elastic energy contribution
due to the surface tensions of the cluster and membrane
is given by
el  c  mRH1S
where R is the cluster radius H1 is the cluster-membrane
height at the interface r  R and S is the slope of the
cluster-membrane at the interface This energy describes
a line tension  2R and vanishes for c  m since
cluster and membrane contributions point in opposite ra-
dial directions
We apply perturbation theory to estimate the sig-
nicance of the surface-tension contribution For this
purpose we use our previously calculated height prole
Eqs 10 and 11 obtained without the surface tension
term Using m  c4  1 kBT nm2 49 and a
physiological cluster radius R  100 nm we nd that
the estimated energy contribution from the surface
tensions is much smaller than the elastic energy Eq 2
ie E
elEel  0004 justifying the neglect of this term
Gaussian curvature
The contribution to the elastic energy from the Gaussian
curvature can be neglected for homogeneous membranes
that do not change their topology Gauss-Bonnet theo-
rem However this contribution is technically non-zero
for our cluster-membrane system In the small deforma-
tion approximation this contribution is given by 39
el  KGcZc 2hc
KGmZm 2hm
y2 cid18 2hc
y2 cid18 2hm
xycid192 d2r
xycid192 d2r A4
where KGcm is the Gaussian curvature modulus for the
cluster membrane
In 49 Eq 129 shows that the
Gaussian energy contribution has two parts One topo-
logical part which is just a constant since our membrane
contains a single receptor cluster The second part is a
contour integral along the cluster boundary Based on
Eq 131 of 49 we obtain
el  KGc  KGmS2
For our height prole Eq
10 and 11 as well as
KGcm  cm2 39 49 this energy contribution is
signicantly smaller than the elastic energy in Eq 2 ie
el Eel  00006 justifying the neglect of this term
As expected this energy contribution vanishes when
the elastic properties of cluster and membrane become
identical for KGc  KGm
