ABSTRACT
We measured the stellar velocity dispersions of 15 active galactic nucleus AGN host galaxies
at redshifts as high as  034 Combining these with published velocity dispersion measurements
from the literature we study the Fundamental Plane of AGN host galaxies and its evolution BL
Lac hosts and radio galaxies seem to lie on the same Fundamental Plane as normal early-type
galaxies The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio of AGN host galaxies shows a similar trend to
that observed in normal early-type galaxies consistent with single-burst passive evolution models
with formation redshifts z  1 The lack of a signicant dierence between normal and AGN host
galaxies in the Fundamental plane supports the Grand Unication picture wherein AGNs are
a transient phase in the evolution of normal galaxies The black hole masses of BL Lac objects
and radio galaxies derived using the mass  dispersion relation are similar The black hole mass
is independent of BL Lac type The local black hole mass  host galaxy luminosity relation of
our sub-sample at z  01 is similar to that of local normal and radio galaxies but is less well
dened at higher redshift due to the luminosity evolution of the host galaxies

holes Kormendy  Gebhardt 2001 suggesting
AGNs are a transient phase in the evolution of nor-
mal galaxies Cavaliere  Padovani 1989 This
Grand Unication hypothesis is supported by
several lines of evidence First the peak of black
hole mass growth which manifests the maximum
AGN activity at z  2 is similar to the peak
of the star formation rate eg Dunlop 1999
Miyaji Hashinger  Schmidt et al 2000 Wolf
et al 2003a Wolf et al 2003b
In individ-
ual AGNs starburst activity is not uncommon
and may be more prevalent than in normal galax-
ies Tadhunter Dickson  Shaw 1996 Melnick
Gopal-Krishna  Terlevich 1997 Aretxaga et al
2001 This apparent association of star formation
and AGN activity suggests that the formation of
the galaxy bulge could simultaneously trigger star
formation and signicant accretion onto a seed
black hole
Second the total local black hole mass es-
timated from inactive black holes at the cen-
ter of the present-day galaxies is comparable to
the black hole mass integrated over the Hubble
time using the quasar luminosity function Yu 
Tremaine 2002
indicating that dormant black
holes in the present-day Universe are plausibly the
end-products of quasar activity see also Cavaliere
 Padovani 1989
Third black hole mass appears to correlate
with galaxy mass in a sample of  40 nearby well-
studied galaxies Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 Geb-
hardt et al 2000a with black hole mass measured
from spatially resolved kinematics This relation
between black hole mass M and bulge stellar ve-
locity dispersion  indicates that somehow the
small-scale black hole knows the large-scale galaxy
properties and vice versa further supporting a
physical connection between galaxy formation and
black hole accretion
Finally AGN host galaxies show the same M-
correlation Gebhardt et al 2000b Ferrarese et al
2001 In this case black hole masses are derived
from reverberation mapping results which gives
one of the most reliable AGN black hole mass mea-
surements Peterson 1993 suggesting the overall
formation processes for black holes and galaxies
are the same for normal and AGN host galaxies
Accordingly we started a program to test the
Grand Unication hypothesis by studying AGN
host galaxies directly Specically we investigate
the Fundamental Plane of AGN host galaxies to
see whether they obey the same tight correlation
among half light radius re surface brightness
e and central velocity dispersion  as normal
galaxies Already it is known that early-type AGN
host galaxies especially radio-loud AGN hosts
follow the Kormendy relation which is a projec-
tion onto the re  e plane Taylor et al 1996
Urry et al 2000 ODowd Urry  Scarpa 2002
Dunlop et al 2003 However this two-parameter
relation has larger scatter than the Fundamental
Plane Dressler et al 1987 Djorgovski  Davis
1987 Faber et al 1987 and lacks the third di-
mension namely velocity dispersion The empiri-
cal scaling relation among re e and  observed
in normal galaxies is interpreted as evidence that
early-type galaxies form a homologous family with
a power-law relation between galaxy mass and the
mass-to-light ratio Due to the very low internal
scatter the Fundamental Plane is often used to
study galaxy formation Franx 1993 Jorgensen et
al 1996 van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 and it is
a much more direct probe of the similarities and
dierences between normal and AGN host galax-
ies Thus we initiated a program to measure  in
the host galaxies of AGN
Ultimately the Fundamental Plane must be
probed at moderate to high redshift where AGN
are more numerous Here we push to z  03
roughly three times as high as most previously
published measurements Bettoni et al
Barth et al 2002 Falome et al 2003 Specif-
ically we report observations and velocity dis-
persion measurements for 15 AGN host galaxies
from z  005 to z  034 Combining with 11
published dispersion measurements we investigate
whether early-type AGN host galaxies lie on the
same Fundamental Plane as normal galaxies and
how the mass-to-light ratio of AGN hosts evolves
relative to that of normal galaxies
In  2 we
describe the observations and velocity dispersion
measurements and in  3 the Fundamental Plane
and its evolution
In  4 we discuss black hole
masses and in  5 we present the discussion and
conclusions The correlations of black hole mass
with other AGN properties will be discussed in de-
tail in a subsequent paper Woo et al 2004 We
adopt a cosmology with   03   07 and
Ho  70 km sec1 Mpc1
2 OBSERVATIONS and DATA REDUC-
21 Sample Selection and Observation
AGN host galaxies are more dicult to study
than normal galaxies due to the presence of bright
central sources To determine the structural pa-
rameters re and e it is necessary to subtract the
AGN contribution from a host galaxy which then
can be analyzed as a normal galaxy Given the im-
portance of high spatial resolution our rst sam-
ple selection criterion was to choose HST-imaged
AGN host galaxies for which reliable structural
parameters are already available
Second we chose low ratios for the AGN-to-
galaxy luminosity Stellar absorption lines are
much harder to detect from a typical bright AGN
spectrum because the brighter nuclear continuum
hides stellar lines and increases noise and AGN
broad emission lines hamper the determination
of the velocity dispersion from stellar absorption
lines Indeed we initially observed several typical
bright AGNs with faint host galaxies but failed to
get reliable stellar signatures even with very high
SN ratios in the observed spectra We concluded
that it is not possible to measure the stellar veloc-
ity dispersion for host galaxies of bright AGNs us-
ing the present observational techniques see also
Barth et al 2002 Therefore we chose BL Lac
objects and radio galaxies which typically do not
have strong emission lines and whose luminosity
is comparable to or smaller than the galaxy light
Third we selected low to intermediate redshift
z  04 objects With 4-6m class telescopes
and typical exposure times of a couple of hours
z  04  05 is the approximate upper limit for
measuring bulge stellar velocity dispersion in AGN
host galaxies
Starting with the sample of 110 BL Lac ob-
jects observed with HST Urry et al 2000 we
selected early-type host galaxies at z  04 giving
 30 BL Lac hosts in the southern and northern
hemispheres In addition we selected several well-
studied radio galaxies at similar redshifts which
were also previously observed with HST
The spectra were obtained with the 65-m Mag-
ellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observa-
tory the CTIO 4-m telescope and the KPNO 4-m
telescope during February to October 2003 Table
1 shows the details of instrumental setups and the
journal of observations We used the BC long-
slit spectrograph at the Magellan Telescope and
the RC long-slit spectrograph at the CTIO and
KPNO telescopes The instrumental setups were
chosen to cover strong stellar absorption lines
such as G-band 4300 A Mgb triplet around
5172 A CaFe around 5269 A and NaD lines
5892 A depending on the redshift and to pro-
vide sucient instrumental resolution  100 km
sec1 Gaussian dispersion so that the expected
velocity dispersions ranging 150 to 350 km sec1
for our target galaxies could be reliably recovered
Sky conditions were mostly photometric with
excellent seeing with the exception of a few nights
when intermittent thin clouds were present We
used a 1 slit width for most of the runs For the
KPNO run we used a 12 slit width due to worse
seeing conditions
Bias frames and at elds were taken in the
afternoon When the grating angle had to be
changed in order to cover dierent wavelength
ranges all calibration frames were also taken
again Arc lamp spectra were taken in the af-
ternoon for an initial wavelength solution and at
each telescope position during the night before
andor after target exposures in order to check
any systematic changes
Late type G8-K5 giant stars with low radial
velocity  20 kmsec were selected as template
stars These stars were observed for each instru-
ment setup mostly at twilight Smaller slit widths
were used for template star observations in order
to obtain a suciently high spectral resolution so
that the Gaussian velocity dispersions of galaxies
and the redshifted templates are comparable
Total exposure times of 1 to 35 hours were used
depending on the host galaxy magnitude Each
total exposure time was typically divided into 30
minute exposures to remove cosmic rays and avoid
CCD saturation in the presence of bright nuclei
22 Data Reduction and Dispersion Mea-
surement
The standard data reduction procedures such
as bias subtraction at-elding spectral extrac-
tion and wavelength calibration were performed
with IRAF routines A one-dimensional spectrum
was extracted from each exposure using aperture
sizes similar to or smaller than the eective radius
of each host galaxy Table 2 Extracted spec-
tra were combined to make the nal spectrum for
each galaxy Out of 18 observed AGN hosts 3
galaxies were removed from further analysis since
the signal-to-noise ratios of galaxy absorption lines
were not sucient to measure the velocity disper-
sion The signal-to-noise ratio of the nal sample
ranges from 25 to  400 per pixel see Table 1 for
the plate scale high enough to measure stellar
velocity dispersions
We used a direct tting method in which the
observed spectrum is directly tted in pixel space
with broadened template spectra The best-tting
dispersion values are determined by the smallest
2 number This method is widely used van der
Marel 1994 Rix et al 1995 Kelson et al 2000a
Barth et al 2002 and has an advantage of eas-
ily removing bad pixels and AGN emission lines
by masking out specic spectral regions in pixel
For the tting procedure featureless continua
with various slopes were added to the template
star spectra to account for the possible presence of
an AGN non-stellar continuum which changes the
line strength as a function of wavelength The ob-
served galaxy and template star spectra were then
normalised by divinding by a continuum t and
re-binned logarithmically Thus a set of template
spectra with various slopes were prepared for each
template star Finally the template spectra were
convolved with Gaussian velocity proles with 50-
400 km sec1 and tted to the normalized galaxy
spectrum using the Gauss-Hermite Pixel Fitting
software1 which is described in Appendix A of
van der Marel 1994
The tting software uses various polynomial or-
ders and line strength parameters to match galaxy
spectra and determines the best 2 t which
gives the velocity dispersion measurement Bad
pixels especially for CTIO 4m data galactic ab-
sorption lines and various emission lines eg
clearly present H and OIII lines were masked
out before tting
Extensive and careful tting with various spec-
tral regions such as G-band H Mgb triplet and
NaD line regions were performed to determine the
best-tting spectral range We used the G-band
region for many galaxies and a larger spectral
range containing from the G-band to the CaFe
lines was chosen for 6 galaxies Various polyno-
mial orders and continuum slopes were used for
tting to test any dependence on the parameters
Deviations with these parameters are similar to
typical measurement errors Changing the spec-
tral type of the template stars gives a larger vari-
ation in the velocity dispersion After tting with
each individual and combined template spectrum
we chose the best-template star with the smallest
2 for each galaxy Figure 1 shows the host galaxy
spectra with the best-tting template
Like Barth et al 2002 we found that Mgb
triplet cannot be t together with nearby lines
such as Fe 5270 and Fe 5335 blends The Mgb
triplet is much deeper in the galaxy spectrum than
in the stellar template However when we ex-
clude the Mgb triplet the overall t was very
good Thus in those cases we masked out the Mgb
triplet for the nal tting see Fig 1a The Mgb
1available at httpwwwstsciedumarelsoftwarehtml
triplet mismatch is partially caused by a dier-
ence in -enhancement between stars in massive
galaxies and Galactic stars Barth et al 2002
We note that the N I emission line which in
some case is clearly present on the red side of the
Mgb triplet will also hamper a good t around
the Mgb triplet region The issue of whether more
accurate values of the velocity dispersion are ob-
tained when the Mgb triplet lines are included or
excluded was addressed in detail by Barth et al
2002 They found that more accurate results are
obtained when the lines are excluded and we have
followed this advice In principle it would be in-
teresting to provide an independent verication of
this nding and to analyze in more detail what
aspects of the stellar and abundance composition
of the galaxies are the cause of this However this
is beyond the scope of the present paper It would
also require a larger sample of higher SN spectra
The measured velocity dispersions m are cor-
rected for dierences in instrumental resolution
between the galaxy and template spectra using
van der Marel et al 1997
vel2  m2  instG2  instT 2 
Here m is the measured velocity dispersion from
the tting and instG and instT are the instru-
mental resolutions of galaxy and template spectra
respectively Note that the instrumental resolu-
tion in km sec1 unit is independent of redshift
For nearby galaxies this correction is unneces-
sary because the instrumental setup of template
and galaxy spectra are the same However this is
not the case for high-redsht galaxies because tem-
plate stars and galaxies are observed at dierent
spectral ranges and thus the instrumental reso-
lution of the template stars should be matched to
that of galaxy spectrum van Dokkum et al 1996
Kelson et al 2000a
Figure 2 shows an example of instrumental res-
olution as a function of wavelength for each instru-
mental setup of our Magellan run The resolution
in A of the template spectrum is 10  20 bet-
ter than that of the galaxy spectrum because of
the smaller slit width 07 Since the template
spectrum resolution is very similar to that of the
galaxy spectrum when the template spectrum is
redshifted for tting the correction for the dif-
ference in instrumental resolutions is very small
We derived instrumental resolutions at the cen-
ter of each tting spectral range for each galaxy
and corrected the galaxy velocity dispersions with
Equation 1 Typical correction values are a few
kmsec We report corrected velocity dispersions
and aperture radii for 15 AGN host galaxies in
Table 2
The velocity dispersion of AP Lib 1514-241
was measured previously by two groups Barth
et al 2002 and Falomo et al 2003 who re-
ported dispersions 196  12 km sec1 and 250  12
km sec1 respectively Several other BL Lac ob-
jects have large discrepancies between the mea-
surements of those two groups as well The source
of the large 4 discrepancy is unclear Our mea-
surement for AP Lib   2427 km sec1 agrees
very well with the value of Falomo et al 2003
3 The Fundamental Plane of AGN Host
Galaxies
Since the Fundamental Plane is well established
among early-type galaxies in nearby clusters eg
Jorgensen et al 1996 it has become a tool to
study the formation and evolution of normal early-
type galaxies AGN host galaxies at least at
very low redshifts also show the same scaling re-
lation Bettoni et al 2001 measured and col-
lected data for 72 radio galaxies and showed that
these low redshift  z  004 galaxies lie on
the Fundamental Plane Barth et al 2002 and
Falomo et al 2003 measured bulge stellar veloc-
ity dispersions for a sample of  10 low redshift
 z  006 BL Lac objects and showed they lie
on the same Fundamental Plane as normal galax-
ies Here we compare the Fundamental Plane of
AGN host galaxies in our higher redshift sample
with that of low-redshift radio and normal galax-
We measured and collected dynamical and
structural parameters for a sample of 26 AGN host
galaxies 23 BL Lac objects and 3 radio galaxies
combining our new higher redshift data with 11
published dispersion measurements from Barth et
al 2002 and Falomo et al 2003 The velocity
dispersions were corrected to a common aperture
equivalent to 34 at the distance of the Coma
cluster z  0023 based on the empirical pre-
scription of Jorgensen et al 1995 For several
common objects in Barth et al 2002 and Falomo
et al 2003 we took the mean of the logarithms
of the two dispersions The errors in the mean
was calculated by propagation of the errors in the
individual measurements see Table 3 Note that
this might underestimate the true errors given
that some of the values of Barth et al 2002 and
Falomo et al 2003 are not mutually consistent
within the errors However this does not aect
the results of our further analysis
For this sample of 26 galaxies structural pa-
rameters are collected from the literature The re
and total galaxy magnitudes are taken from the
HST snapshot survey of BL Lac objects Urry et
al 2000 with a few exceptions in which the HST-
measured host galaxy size re is more than factor
of 2 smaller than the ground-based result These
4 cases namely Mrk 180 Mrk 421 Mrk 501 and
3C 371 are all at very low redshift z  005 and
have large eective radii re  10 Due to the
small eld of view of WFPC2 overestimated sky
background would lead to an underestimate of re
Barth et al 2002 Falomo et al 2003 Thus for
these four cases we took the median of all avail-
able re data from Falomo et al 2003 The mean
surface brightness within the re is derived from
the total magnitude of the host galaxy using

sured in the Cousins R band Urry et al 20002

tion in the R band taken from the NED database3

31 Comparing with Radio and Normal
Galaxies
Radio galaxies and BL Lac objects are believed
to constitute the same AGN family with dier-
ent orientation angles Urry  Padovani 1995
Here we compare the Fundamental Plane of the
Bettoni sample of radio galaxies along with our

Urry et al 2000 is not extinction corrected

AGN sample in Figure 3 The two panels corre-
spond to two dierent edge-on projections The
axes of the two panels are such that the 72 radio
galaxies of Bettoni et al 2001 are viewed edge-
on The dashed line is the Fundamental Plane
t dened for 72 radio galaxies small dots in
Bettoni et al 2001 who demonstrated that ra-
dio galaxies lie on the same Fundamental Plane
as normal early-type galaxies although the actual
data points small dots present signicant scatter
019 in log re probably due to the data qual-
ity and uncertainties in color transformation The
twenty-three BL Lac hosts and 3 radio galaxies in
our sample also follow the same correlation All
scales in this gure only are corrected to Ho  50
km sec1 Mpc1 and qo  0 for consistency with
Bettoni et al
2001 Our dispersion measure-
ments lled circles show a similar trend to that
observed by Barth et al 2002 and Falomo et al
2003 open circles We do not nd any signi-
cant dierence in the Fundamental Plane between
BL Lac hosts and radio galaxies The RMS scat-
ter in our sample is 0103 in log re Substracting
the measurement errors in quadrature we nd the
intrinsic scatter to be 0071 in log re
We also compare the normal galaxy Fundamen-
tal Plane with that of AGN host galaxies to test
the Grand Unication picture Figure 4 shows
two edge-on projections of the Fundamental Plane
The axes of the two panels are such that the
Coma cluster galaxies in Jorgensen et al 1996
are viewed edge-on The dashed line is a t to
the Coma cluster galaxies small dots from Jor-
gensen et al 1996 Our sample of AGN host
galaxies converted from the Cousins R band to
the Gunn r band assuming r-R035 Jorgensen
1994 are plotted with dierent symbols based on
redshift This gure shows that AGN host galax-
ies lie on the same Fundamental Plane as normal
galaxies The higher redshift host galaxies lie be-
low the dashed line because the surface bright-
ness is brighter on average due to the younger
stellar populations assuming re and  are not
changed This trend is also seen in cluster and
eld early-type galaxies in similar redshift ranges
van Dokkum et al 1996 Treu et al 2001 and
corresponds to an evolution of the Fundamental
Plane By correcting passive luminosity evolution
with a stellar population synthesis model with for-
mation redshift zf orm  2 the Fundamental Plane
becomes tighter see  32
32 Mass-to-light ratio evolution
The mass-to-light ratio is a fundamental prop-
erty of galaxies and a basic tool for studying
galaxy evolution Franx 1993 If early-type galax-
ies formed at relatively high redshift and evolved
passively afterward the evolution of the Funda-
mental Plane is simply caused by the dimming
of surface brightness due to the aging of the stel-
lar population Tinsley  Gunn 1976 However
if early-type galaxies experience mergers at rela-
tively low redshift the evolution of the Fundamen-
tal Plane will be dierent due to the ensuing star
formation Thus the study of the mass-to-light ra-
tio evolution through the Fundamental Plane can
constrain the galaxy formation history
Various recent studies of high redshift up to
z  1 early-type galaxies have attempted to test
galaxy formation scenarios eg monolithic col-
lapse versus merging models by estimating the
star formation epoch showing that eld and clus-
ter early-type galaxies formed at z  1 and
evolved passively afterward Kelson et al 2000b
Treu et al 2001 van Dokkum et al 2001 Treu et
al 2002 Gebhardt et al 2003 Rusin et al 2003
van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 van der Wel et al
2004 The evolution of the mass-to-light ratio in
early-type cluster galaxies 002  z  127 is
consistent with a single burst of star formation at
z  23 but we note that at higher redshift the
picture may be more complex One of 3 galax-
ies at z  127 shows much lower mass-to-light
ratio and strong Balmer absorption lines indicat-
ing a younger stellar population than predicted
with zf orm  23 models van Dokkum  Stan-
ford 2003
In the case of early-type eld galaxies the for-
mation redshift ranges from z  13 with at least
some observational studies reporting that early-
type eld galaxies show a steeper mass-to-light
ratio evolution van Dokkum et al 2001 Treu
et al 2002 Gebhardt et al 2003 This sug-
gests the average age of their stellar population is
younger than that of cluster galaxies qualitatively
consistent with hierarchical merging models that
predict early-types in the eld formed later than in
clusters due to the less dense environment Kau-
man 1996 Diaferio et al 2001 However the
age dierence between eld and cluster galaxies
estimated from the observed mass-to-light ratios
is much smaller than predicted with hierarchical
merging models van Dokkum et al 2001 Treu
It is not even clear whether eld galax-
ies formed later than cluster galaxies since other
studies suggest that eld and cluster early-type
galaxies have a comparable formation epoch with
similar stellar population ages van Dokkum  El-
lis 2003 Rusin et al 2003 At each epoch of
observation there are plausibly various early-type
galaxies with stellar populations formed at dier-
ent epochs zf orm  13 since there is a large
scatter in the mass-to-light ratio among eld early-
type galaxies up to z  1 indicating a signicant
age spread among eld galaxies van de Ven et al
2003 van der Wel et al 2004
If AGN host galaxies are fundamentally normal
galaxies with an active nucleus the evolution of
the mass-to-light ratio should be similar to that
of normal galaxies In this section we investigate
the mass-to-light ratio evolution of our sample of
26 AGN host galaxies
Because of the virial theorem galaxy masses
can be derived with
M  K 2 re  G
where K is a constant and re is the eective radius
By denition the luminosity of a galaxy is given
by L  2r2
e Ie where Ie is the average surface
brightness within the eective radius Hence the
mass-to-light ratio is given by
log ML  2 log   log Ie  log re  C
where the constant C  logK2G
Gunn r band log Ie  04 e  264 where
Ie is in Lpc2 and e is the surface brightness in
mag arcsec2 Jorgensen et al 1996 If galaxies
evolve without merging or accretion the mass-to-
light ratio evolves due to the luminosity evolution
of the stellar populations while the mass  and
re remain the same van Dokkum  Franx 1996
Using these relations we estimated the mass-to-
light ratio for each host galaxy and its evolution
by normalizing it with the Fundamental Plane of
the Coma cluster galaxies All parameters were
corrected to a common set of cosmological param-
eters Ho  70 km sec1 Mpc1   03 and
  07
We also modeled the evolution of the mass-to-
light ratio in the Gunn r band using stellar pop-
ulation synthesis models with the Salpeter IMF
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 The star formation
rate is assumed to be exponentially decreasing
SF R  expt   
where t is the time elapsed since the galaxy formed
and  is the e-folding time of the star formation
Figure 5 shows the passive evolution model pre-
dictions of the mass-to-light ratio in the Gunn r
band depending on the formation redshift and  
To address the evolution of AGN hosts we com-
pare high-redshift hosts to low-redshift hosts We
dene  logML to be dierence in logarithm
between the ML at a certain redshift and the
ML in our lowest AGN host redshift bin which
is centered on z  0046 The Figure shows both
the mass-to-light ratio of individual host galaxies
open circles and the averaged ML values over
each redshift bin lled circles There is a clear
ML decrease as a function of redshift The mass-
to-light ratio at z  0046 corresponds to a 38
increase since z  0324 which can be reproduced
by a single burst model with zf orm  2 although
the data points are consistent with the passive
evolution models of zf orm  1 within the 68 
condence limit based on 2 analysis The mass-
to-light ratio evolution in the Gunn r band corre-
sponds to logMLrz  051  018 Us-
ing the stellar population models consistent with
this value we estimated the ML evolution in the
rest-frame B band logMLBz  062
The trend of the ML evolution of our AGN host
galaxies is similar to that of normal galaxies in
the eld and clusters with star formation epoch
at zf orm  13 logMLBz  046072
Treu et al 2002 Rusin et al 2003 van de Ven
et al 2003 van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 A
larger sample of higher redshift z  03 galax-
ies is clearly required to narrow down the forma-
tion epoch of AGN host galaxies ODowd  Urry
2004 We note however that a higher zf orm
model with extended star formation thin-solid
line and a lower zf orm single burst model dashed
line predict the very similar mass-to-light ratio
evolution especially at low redshift
Correcting the surface brightness of the galaxies
in our sample using the single burst model with
zf orm  2 predictions for the ML evolution as
in Figure 4 the Fundamental Plane shows a tight
correlation within RMS scatter 0095 in log re
Subtracting the measurement errors in quadra-
ture we nd the intrinsic scatter of the Funda-
mental Plane to be 0080 in log re which is close
to the intrinsic scatter 0070 of the Fundamental
Plane of nearby clusters Jorgensen et al 1996
We also estimated each galaxy mass using
Equation 3 with K  5 as suggested by Bender
et al 1992 AGN host galaxies show the same
trend as normal galaxies in that more massive
galaxies have larger mass-to-light ratios Fig 6
Using the luminosity correction with zf orm  2
model we obtain ML  M 038006 which is
similar to that of normal galaxies Jorgensen et
al 1996
We conclude that there is no signicant dier-
ence of the ML evolution between normal and
AGN host galaxies The AGN host galaxies show
the same Fundamental Plane the same ML re-
lation and a similar star formation epoch
4 AGN BLACK HOLE MASS
41 Black Hole Mass of BL Lac Objects
and Radio Galaxies
AGN black hole masses estimated from rever-
beration mapping results show the same corre-
lation with bulge kinematics as normal galaxies
Gebhardt et al 2000b Ferrarese et al 2001
This tight correlation between black hole mass and
bulge dispersion plausibly holds up to the epoch
when galaxies have formed and virialized Shields
et al 2003 after which the kinematical properties
of each galaxy should be approximately stationary
Therefore the mass-dispersion correlation is prob-
ably valid for galaxies that lie on the Fundamental
Our sample of AGN host galaxies at z  034
shows the same Fundamental Plane as normal
and radio galaxies particularly at similar redshift
range common to all samples as we shown in  3
Thus we estimate the black hole mass of these
objects using the M- relation of normal galax-
ies Tremaine et al 2002
M  1349  108Me200km s1402 
with proper aperture corrections for e following
Jorgensen et al 1995 which gives at most a 10
 change in the velocity dipersion value
In Figure 7 we show the distribution of black
hole masses for BL Lac objects ranging from a few
tens of millions to a billion solar masses similar to
the black hole mass ranges of normal Kormendy
 Gebhardt 2001 and radio galaxies Woo  Urry
2002 It seems that regardless of the strength of
the AGN activity black hole mass spans a similar
range although the upper and lower limits of the
black hole mass are not constrained
The spectral energy distributions of BL Lac ob-
jects show two distinct peaks at low and high fre-
quencies due to synchrotron and inverse Compton
emission from the unresolved nucleus The peak
frequencies vary systematically and BL Lacs have
been divided into two types namely low-energy
peaked LBL and high-energy peaked HBL Us-
ing measured velocity dispersions Barth et al
2002 and Falomo et al
2003 derived black
hole masses using the M- relation and found
similar BH mass ranges between LBL and HBL
as predicted by Urry et al
2000 on the basis
of their similar host galaxy luminosities With a
larger sample of BL Lac objects we conrm that
black hole mass is independent of BL Lac type
suggesting black hole mass does not control the
peak frequency Fig 7
42 Black Hole Mass to Galaxy Luminos-
ity Relation
We derived the black hole mass to host galaxy
luminosity relation in the Cousins R band Fig
8 For the 11 objects at z  01 the best t is
MM  051011  MR  323247 
Here MR is the rest-frame absolute R magni-
tude of the host galaxy determined using the ap-
parent magnitude after correcting for foreground
Galactic extinction and applying a K correction
Higher redshift objects are removed before tting
since younger stellar populations can alter the lo-
cal z  01 black hole mass  galaxy luminosity
relation The derived slope of the mass  luminos-
ity relation in the Cousins R band is -051 similar
to -050 derived for local normal and radio galaxy
samples McLure  Dunlop 2002 Bettoni et al
2003 indicating the local mass  luminosity re-
lation is indistinguishable among normal radio
and AGN host galaxies The mass  luminosity
relation derived from a sample of large redshift
range suers intrinsic scatter because host galaxy
luminosity evolves as a function of time while the
galaxy mass remains the same probably up to the
epoch of galaxy formation see Fig 4 of McLure
 Dunlop 2002 Also if derived from the local
mass  luminosity relation the black hole mass
of high-redshift AGN will be overestimated due to
the younger stellar population
Therefore we looked explicitly at the eect of
luminosity evolution We corrected all absolute
R magnitudes to z  0 using a stellar popula-
tion synthesis model with zf orm  2 We then
derived the mass  luminosity relation for high-
z  01 and low-redshift z  01 galaxies The
slope between mass and luminosity for the high-
redshift sample is 045  012 lower than that of
the low redshift sample 052  011 but con-
sistent within the uncertainties The values of
y-intercept are also consistent within the uncer-
tainties 333  245 for the low-redshift sample
203  273 for the high-redshift sample The
RMS scatter increases from 016 to 024 in logM
suggesting the intrinsic scatter of the relation is
larger at high redshift However it might be sim-
ply due to the larger luminosity correction error
for younger galaxies at higher redshift
5 DISCUSSION and CONCLUSION
We report new stellar velocity dispersion mea-
surements for 15 AGN host galaxies at z  034
Combining with published measurements for 11
low redshift  z  006 BL Lac hosts and 72
low redshift  z  004 radio galaxies we nd
that AGN host galaxies lie on the same Funda-
mental Plane as normal galaxies The mass-to-
light ratio increases  40 since z  03 which is
similar to that of normal early-type galaxies and
consistent with single burst galaxy formation mod-
els with zf orm  1 indicating AGN host galaxies
formed at high redshift and evolved passively af-
terward The fact that AGN host galaxies show
the same Fundamental Plane and mass-to-light
ratio evolution as normal galaxies indicates that
there is no fundamental dierence between AGN
hosts and normal early-type galaxies Although
BL Lac objects and radio galaxies do not repre-
sent all families of AGNs this is yet another step
to conrm AGN as a transient phase of normal
galaxy evolution also known as the Grand Uni-
cation hypothesis More studies including radio-
quiet AGNs and more AGNs at high redshift are
required to further verify this However measure-
ments of bulge stellar velocity dispersion for host
galaxies with a bright nucleus are extremely di-
cult due to the presence of luminous AGN contin-
uum New techniques will be necessary to over-
come this barrier
We estimated black hole masses for the com-
bined sample of AGN host galaxies using the M-
 correlation The black hole mass distribution of
23 BL Lac objects is similar to that of 72 local ra-
dio galaxies We also conrm that black hole mass
is independent of BL Lac object type suggesting
the peak frequency of BL Lac SED is controlled
by other parameters
The correlation between black hole mass and
galaxy luminosity for a sub-sample of AGNs at
z  01 has a slope consistent with that of local
radio and normal galaxies The mass  luminosity
relation derived for larger redshift AGN is uncer-
tain due to the luminosity evolution of the host
galaxies

lled circles and galaxy spectra open circles
as a function of wavelength as obtained with the

mined as Gaussian dispersion measurements from
He-Ne-Ar Arc lamp lines for each instrumental
setup The resolution in A of the template spec-
trum is  10  20 better due to the smaller slit
width 07 so that the resolution of the galaxy
and redshifted template spectra are very similar

slopes and y-intercepts of this relation for high-

uncertainties although the RMS scatter of higher
redshift objects is larger The error bars on the

black hole mass is the propagated error from the
