ABSTRACT
Constraining the star formation histories SFHs of individual galaxies is crucial to understanding the mech-
anisms that regulate their evolution Here we combine multi-wavelength ultraviolet optical and infrared
measurements of a very large sample of galaxies 230000 at z  016 with physically motivated models of
galaxy spectral energy distributions to extract constraints on galaxy physical parameters such as stellar mass
and star formation rate as well as individual SFHs In particular we set constraints on the timescales in which
galaxies form a certain percentage of their total stellar mass namely 10 50 and 90 The large statistics
allows us to average such measurements over different populations of galaxies quiescent and star-forming
and in narrow ranges of stellar mass As in the downsizing scenario we conrm that low-mass galaxies have
more extended SFHs than high-mass galaxies We also nd that at the same observed stellar mass galaxies
that are now quiescent evolve more rapidly than galaxies that are currently still forming stars This suggests
that stellar mass is not the only driver of galaxy evolution but plays along with other factors such as merger
events and other environmental effects
Subject headings galaxies evolution  galaxies star formation  galaxies stellar content
1 INTRODUCTION
Recent progresses in simulations of galaxy formation and
the increasing quantity and quality of galaxy data are nally
allowing us to assess the way galaxies form stars and evolve
The aims of such studies are numerous to assess the effects
of certain processes of galaxy formation eg merger events
gas accretion and feedback mechanisms on the physical pa-
rameters and the morphology of galaxies to link galaxies to
their progenitors and to understand how and when galaxies
form evolve in an active phase and eventually stop forming
stars to evolve passively

The picture we have of galaxy evolution is a result of
the combination of constraints obtained with different
methodologies and datasets A rst approximation to the star
formation history SFH of galaxies is the evolution of the

star-forming galaxies to quiescence is required also by the fact
that the population of local quiescent galaxies is not consistent
with a simple passive evolution of the population of quiescent
galaxies at z  1 Schiavon et al 2006 Gallazzi et al 2014
The SFH of the Universe can be studied not only ob-
serving galaxies at different redshifts but also from the
fossil record of present-day data eg Panter et al 2003
Panter et al 2007 Gonzalez-Delgado et al 2014 Without
strong prior assumptions on the shape of the SFHs of galax-
ies evidence that SFHs are stochastic and non-parametric
has been found by Pacici et al 2013 Bauer et al 2013 and
McDermid et al 2015 This evidence is also an important
piece of information in unveiling the mechanisms that are
involved in the evolution of galaxies Also
the relative
importance of in-situ star formation and merger events has
been studied by Ownsworth et al 2014 through the selection
of the progenitors of local massive galaxies in the range
03  z  3
Klypin et al 2011
these observations have triggered the development
of more and more comprehensive cosmological
Springel et al 2005 Croton et al 2006
ulations
Somerville et al 2008
including
both dark matter and baryonic physics along with the
necessary prescriptions for stellar and AGN feedback
These simulations allow us to identify the progenitors
Behroozi et al 2013
Papovich et al 2015 and study the mechanisms involved
in the evolution of galaxies eg minor and major mergers
stellar and AGN feedback gas-accretion from laments
Moster et al 2013
galaxies
Galaxy observations allow us to observe the effects of
such mechanisms at snapshots in time while cosmologi-
cal simulations can predict what mechanisms are respon-
sible for the changes in galaxy morphology color and
physical parameters between one snapshot and the follow-
In order to properly connect observations to simula-
tions and learn about these mechanisms of evolution we need
to interpret large datasets of galaxies spanning a large pa-
rameter space with as-realistic-as-possible spectral-energy-
distribution SED models
Pacici et al
With the approach described in Pacici et al 2012 we can
compare cosmological simulations to real observations and
derive meaningful constraints on the SFHs of galaxies We
build physically motivated SEDs of galaxies by combining the
semi-analytic post processing of a large cosmological simula-
tion with state-of-the-art models of the light from stars and
gas and the attenuation by dust We then use this large vari-
ety of SEDs to extract constraints from photometric and spec-
troscopic observations of galaxies In this work we focus on
low-redshift galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey SDSS The combination of physically motivated SFHs
and a large dataset gives us the opportunity to estimate the
timescales of formation and SFH shapes of different popula-
tions of galaxies covering a large stellar mass range for both
quiescent and star-forming galaxies
A comprehensive view on the SFHs of galaxies covering a
broad range of physical parameters is very important to cal-
ibrate cosmological simulations and unveil the processes re-
sponsible for the evolution of galaxies We start here a series
of papers in which we constrain the SFHs of a large sample
of galaxies at redshift 002  z  016 This paper is orga-
nized as follows in Section 2 and 3 we present the multi-
wavelegth dataset and the modelling approach respectively
in Section 4 we show and discuss the constraints we extract
from the photometric ts in Section 5 we present a summary
and our conclusions In the following papers we will compare
our results with predictions from different cosmological sim-
ulations Paper II we will include spectroscopic constraints
for a subsample of recently quenched galaxies Paper III we
will select a subsample of galaxies and look for evidences of
particular evolutionary mechanisms in the morphology of the
galaxies Paper IV and we will assess the effects of environ-
ment Paper V
Throughout the Paper we adopt a Chabrier initial mass
function IMF Chabrier 2003 and a standard CDM cos-
mology with M  03   07 h  07 Magnitudes
are given in AB system
2 DATA
We select a sample of galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS Data Release 10 Ahn et al 2014 SDSS pro-
vides us with optical photometry in ve broad bands ugriz
and ber spectroscopy in the wavelength range 3800 
 A  9200 and thus accurate spectroscopic redshifts for
about 18 million galaxies in the nearby Universe We focus
on the redshift range 002  z  016 which includes the bulk
of SDSS observations and covers the last 2 Gyr in the history
of the Universe 512961 galaxies6 To include only galaxies
with accurate photometry we select Petrosian magnitudes
we apply the following criteria r  222 mag which is the
magnitude limit for point sources 94 of the galaxies are
detected at r  1777 which is the magnitude limit of the
SDSS spectroscopic Main Sample see Figure 1a uncertain-
ties in griz bands smaller than 02 mag7 similar photometric
aperture in all bands less than 3 kpc difference relative to the
aperture in the r band This leaves us with 454293 galaxies
To better assess the young stellar component of the galax-
ies in the sample Salim et al 2005 we extend the cover-
age to ultraviolet wavelengths matching the sample with mea-
surements from GALEX Galaxy Evolution Explorer Gen-
6 We selected only galaxies with clean photometry ags as suggested
from SDSS III DR10 tutorial
7 We do not include the u band See Section 32 for more details
eral Release 67 Martin et al 2005 GALEX samples near-
ultraviolet NUV   2316 A and far-ultraviolet FUV
  1539 A wavelengths We match the 454293 galaxies
with GALEX NUV detections matching radius of 3 arcsec
that are within 05 degrees from each tile center and have un-
certainties smaller than 05 magnitudes After the matching
we are left with 233816 galaxies 58 of which are also de-
tected in the FUV band
In order to constrain also the oldest stellar populations
we need to include measurements at near-infrared wave-
lengths
The Two Micron All Sky Survey 2MASS
Skrutskie et al 2006 provides us with measurements in J
H and K bands but unfortunately only for the most massive
galaxies about half of the sample This is not preferable be-
cause we wish to keep good number statistics for low-mass
galaxies and have comparable constraints and thus compa-
rable error bars for all galaxies We decide thus to move to
slightly larger wavelengths and match the 233816 galaxies
in the sample with the Wide-eld Infrared Survey Explorer
WISE Wright et al 2010 WISE is a full-sky survey in the
34 46 12 and 22 m mid-infrared bandpasses For this
study we consider only the 34 m observations W1 here-
after since uxes at longer wavelengths are contaminated
by the emission by warm dust which is not included in our
spectral modelling approach see Section 3 Adopting again
a matching radius of 3 arcsec and following the guidelines
of Chang et al 2015 we nd that 232343 galaxies out of
233816 are detected in the W1 band W1 photometric mea-
surements are systematically fainter than measurements of the
same objects using deeper and higher spatial resolution data
from the Spitzer Space Telescope This bias occurs because
background levels were overestimated in the source extraction
process We thus apply the magnitude correction calculated
by Chang et al 2015 to enhance the ux in W1 as a function
of the effective radii of the galaxies The median correction is
025 mag and it is applied whenever galaxies are larger than
05 arcsec
We use the emission-line catalogue by Oh et al 2011
OSSY8 to identify active galactic nuclei AGNs among
the sources in the sample We nd that 449 galax-
ies show broad emission lines and are thus classied
as type-1 AGNs Oh et al 2015
In type-1 AGNs
the optical continuum is dominated by non-thermal emis-
sion thus we remove these objects from the sample we
are left with 231894 galaxies
Using the standard
Baldwin et al 1981 line-diagnostic diagram and the conser-
vative criterion of Kauffmann et al 2003a 38 of the galax-
ies 89077 are identied as type-2 AGNs 20241 out of
these 89077 are classied as Seyfert galaxies According
to Kauffmann et al 2003a the type-2 AGN continuum emis-
sion does not affect the estimates of the physical parameters
derived from optical photometric ts At longer wavelengths
Assef et al 2010 provide an AGN color selection using WISE
observations Using their criterion W 1  W 2  085 in
Vega magnitudes only about 1 of the galaxies in our sam-
ple seem to show AGN features in the broad bands suggesting
that at these low redshifts the stellar light is not strongly con-
taminated by AGN light We thus decide to neglect possible
contaminations by type-2 AGNs when running the photomet-
ric ts
8 The OSSY catalog is based on SDSS DR7 spectra Emission-line mea-
surements are available for 92 of the galaxies in the DR10 sample used in
this work
Timing the evolution of local galaxies
All magnitudes are corrected for foreground galactic ex-
tinction with the dust map of Schlay  Finkbeiner 2011
assuming a galactic extinction law with RV  31
Fitzpatrick 1999 We do not correct W1 as the correction
is negligible
3 MODELING APPROACH
To derive physical parameters and SFHs of the 231894
galaxies in the sample from multi-band photometry we need
to appeal to a comprehensive spectral modelling technique
Reliable constraints can be obtained only when the adopted
library of model SEDs can properly reproduce the observed
data and includes a large variety of SFH shapes We adopt the
approach described in Pacici et al 2012 which includes re-
alistic SFHs from cosmological simulations stellar and nebu-
lar emission computed consistently and a comprehensive pre-
scription to model the attenuation by dust We introduce here
the library of model SEDs and the tting technique
31 Library of model spectral energy distributions
We assemble a model spectral library including physically
motivated star formation and chemical enrichment histories
derived from a post-treatment of the Millennium cosmolog-
ical simulation Springel et al 2005 using the semi-analytic
models of De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 This approach allows us
to explore a wide range of non-parametric SFHs including
declining rising roughly constant bursty and smooth evo-
lutionary shapes in addition to realistic chemical enrichment
histories We generate 15 million galaxy SFHs selecting ran-
domly the redshift of observation in the range 001  z 
017 appropriate to cover the range of the sample described
in Section 2 and the evolutionary stage at observation be-
tween 0 and 6 Gyr in lookback time see Sections 21 and
312 of Pacici et al 2012 In other words this resample al-
lows the model galaxies to be younger than what the Millen-
nium simulation predicts at a given redshift of observation
To further widen the range of physical properties probed by
this library we re-sample the current ie averaged over
a period of 10Myr before a galaxy is looked at star forma-
tion properties of each star-forming model galaxy about 60
of the galaxies in the library while leaving unchanged the
properties of quiescent galaxies9 In practice for star-forming
model galaxies we redraw the SSFR randomly in the range
2  logSGyr1  15 and the current gas-phase oxy-
gen abundance in the range 7  12  log OH  94
We combine this set of SFHs with the latest version of
the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 stellar population synthesis mod-
els reprocessed with the photoionization code CLOUDY
Ferland 1996 as in Charlot  Longhetti 2001 to compute
the nebular emission consistently with the emission by stel-
lar populations of different ages neglecting the contribution
by stars older than 10 Myr which produce negligible ionizing
radiation We include dust attenuation using a more com-
prehensive implementation of the Charlot  Fall 2000 two-
component dust model In this work the slope of the attenu-
ation curve is xed in the birth clouds n  13 and it is
drawn randomly in the range 10  n  04 in the dif-
fuse interstellar medium ISM to reect uncertainties about
the spatial distribution of dust and the orientation of a galaxy
see Pacici et al 2012 Chevallard et al 2013 We take the

SFR divided by the stellar mass S  M larger than 001 Gyr1

total effective optical depth of the dust V to be randomly
distributed between 0 and 4 for star-forming galaxies and be-
tween 0 and 2 for quiescent galaxies to account for galaxies
with two main populations eg a star-forming disk and a
quiescent bulge
In Figure 1 we show a comparison between the observer-
frame colors of the galaxies in the sample blue contours
and the colors predicted by the spectral library gray con-
tours for the entire redshift range The spectral library can
well reproduce the observed colors of the galaxies in the sam-
ple N U V  g Figure 1b and N U V  r Figure 1d col-
ors clearly show the bimodality in the galaxies quiescent
galaxies are characterized by red colors large N U V  g and
N U V  r while star-forming galaxies lie in the blue region
low N U V  g and N U V  r Since we are requiring a
detection in N U V  we might be missing a population of very
red galaxies that fall below the sensitivity of GALEX In the
sample presented in Section 2 about 60 of the galaxies are
blue in g  r color g  r  075 If we do not ask for a
detection in N U V 454293 galaxies see Section 2 the op-
tical colors spanned by the galaxies are similar to those of the
sample presented in Section 2 as shown in Figure 1c and
still about 60 of the galaxies are blue according to the same
color criteria The sample presented is thus not biased by the
request of GALEX NUV detection In Figure 1b and d
a small fraction of the observed galaxies about 2 falls be-
yond the edge of the model library at large N U V  g and
N U V  r colors These outliers are all characterized by large
uncertainties in the NUV measurements  05 mag and thus
can still be safely compared to the model spectral library
32 Fitting procedure
We use a Bayesian approach as in Pacici et al 2012 to
compare the SEDs of each of the 231894 galaxies in the sam-
ple to the SEDs of the galaxies in the model spectral library In
practice for each galaxy in the sample we calculate the like-
lihood of each of the 15 million model galaxies at redshifts
z  zobservation  001 to reproduce the observed SED and
we build probability density functions PDFs of stellar mass
MM star formation rate Myr1 total effective
optical depth of the dust V  and rest-frame dust-corrected
N U V  g and g  i colors We also extract the best-estimate
SFHs by averaging the rst 10 best-t model SFHs weighted
by their likelihood
In the likelihood t we include the 7 photometric bands
F U V N U V g r i z W 1 presented in Section 210 We do
not include the u band because we nd the observed ux sys-
tematically fainter 01 magnitudes on average than what is
predicted by the model library11 Although this deviation is
not large we nd that if we do not include the u band in
the ts the distributions of the residuals between observed
and best-t magnitudes in neighboring bands N U V  g and
r is Gaussian while if we include the u band these distri-
butions become asymmetric to correct for the discrepancy
between models and observations in the u band This dis-
crepancy could be caused by complications in the data re-
duction or by uncertainties in the stellar evolution models
10 We apply a minimum uncertainty of 5 on all bands to account for the
fact that the uncertainties might be sometimes underestimated and systematic
errors might have been ignored
11 The exclusion of this photometric measurement is not critical as the
ultraviolet light is already probed by the GALEX N U V band for which the
comparison with the model library does not show any systematic bias

see for example Worthey et al 1996 Another possible ex-
planation for the discrepancy could be an inaccurate match
between GALEX and SDSS photometry Given the large
point spread function of GALEX source confusion could
generate issues when matching the catalogs see for example
Moustakas et al 2013 However if the mismatch was severe
for a signicant number of galaxies we would expect a dis-
crepancy much larger than 01 magnitudes in the u band To
check for this effect we limit the sample to the SDSS galax-
ies with a GALEX match within 2 arcsec instead of 3 arcsec

this radius 62 of the galaxies and with exposure time in

which the galaxies form 10 50 and 90 of the total stellar mass re-
spectively We pick 1000 random galaxies from the sample and extract the
evolutionary stages from the best-t SFHs derived from the photometric ts
We re-t these 1000 model galaxies and retrieve the evolutionary stages from
the best-estimate SFHs as described in Section 32 We then compare the
obtained evolutionary stages with the true values This procedure allows us
to quantify the accuracy and uncertainty to which the evolutionary stages are
constrained See text for details
N U V greater than 1000 s 34 of the galaxies The discrep-
ancy in the u band for this subsample of galaxies is the same
as for the full sample suggesting that this is not the cause of
the discrepancy In Section 4 we will check that our results do
not change when using this more conservative subsample We
note that the uncertainties in the photometry are included in
the ts thus in case of short observations or possible contam-
inations GALEX uncertainties will be larger than the average
and thus GALEX measurements will be down-weighted in the
To check that the correction we apply on WISE W1 magni-
tudes does not introduce any signicant bias we compare the
predicted magnitudes from the best-t models in J H and
K bands with the observed ones from 2MASS after match-

ing to the SDSS r-band position with a 2 arcsec matching
radius We remind the reader that only massive galaxies are
detected by 2MASS Best-t magnitudes are slightly brighter
than the observed ones in all three bands but the difference is
on average within 1 We thus are positive that the matching
and magnitude corrections are not introducing severe biases

sponds to the lookback time at the redshift of observation and
from the full model library in magenta The SFH extracted
using the whole library is naturally smoother than the one av-
eraged on 10 models The red vertical dashed lines represent
the lookback times at which the galaxy forms 10 t10 50
t50 and 90 t90 of the total stellar mass formed in the
entire lifetime From now on we refer to t10 t50 and t90
as evolutionary stages In the bottom panels of Figure 2 we
show the PDFs of stellar mass SFR optical depth of the dust
and rest-frame dust-corrected N U V  g and g  i colors The
typical uncertainties on these ve quantities are 01 dex 05
dex 05 04 mag and 01 mag respectively
To derive the best-estimate SFHs we made the choice of
averaging over the rst 10 best-t models instead of using all
the models in the library as it is done for the single param-
eters eg stellar mass SFR etc This choice allows the
procedure to be computationally much less expensive given
the number of galaxies in the sample still providing a good
representation of the SFHs derived including in the weighted
average all models with likelihood greater than zero This
is the case because the PDFs of the extracted parameters are
generally well behaved ie they are single-peaked To verify
this we extract PDFs of the light-weighted age which is the
parameter most sensitive to the SFH shape The uncertainties
on the light-weighted age are smaller than 02 dex for 96 of
the sample thus most likely the PDFs are not double-peaked
In the Appendix we show the ts of few example galaxies for
which we have computed the average SFHs using the rst 10
best-t models and the full model library The shapes of the
SFHs compare well with one other
To estimate the uncertainties on the derived evolutionary
stages t10 t50 and t90 we extract best estimates of these
quantities tting a sample of model galaxies and we compare
the results with the true values
In practice 1 we extract
from the ts the best-t photometry and SFHs of 1000 galax-
ies randomly picked from the observed sample 2 for each of
the 1000 galaxies we t the best-t photometry adopting the
photometric uncertainties as in the original observed sample
and removing from the model library the best-t model and
we extract the best-estimate SFH 3 we compare the evolu-
tionary stages of the best-estimate SFHs of the 1000 galaxies
with the true values from the tted models In Figure 3 we
compare the extracted evolutionary stages with the true values
for the 1000 model galaxies We nd that t10 green circles is
mildly overestimated by a median of 038 Gyr and the median
uncertainty is 093 Gyr The mild overestimate of t10 can be
explained by the fact that the luminosity of a small fraction of
stars at such old ages can be hidden by the luminosity of more
recent stars The ts account for this possibly hidden mass and
thus return a slightly older t10 compared to the true value t50
blue squares is well recovered median accuracy of 002
Gyr with median uncertainty of 077 Gyr t90 purple trian-
gles is similarly well recovered with median accuracies and
uncertainties of 007 and 032 Gyr respectively

pleteness limits are logMM  85 90 97 104 109

4 THE STAR FORMATION HISTORIES OF LOCAL GALAXIES
Constraints on the SFHs of the galaxies in the sample Sec-
tion 2 can show us whether different types of galaxies eg
currently quiescent or star-forming evolve following differ-
ent paths In this Section we rst explore the relation between
SFH evolutionary stages and stellar mass being the latter a
driver of galaxy evolution12 We then assess the rest-frame
dust-corrected colors of the galaxies in the sample as a func-
tion of SFH properties A careful assessment of the uncertain-
ties is needed to draw meaningful conclusions
41 Evolutionary stages of observed galaxies
Using the procedure described in Section 32 we derive
best estimates of stellar mass SFR SFH and N U V  g and
g  i colors for each galaxy in the observed sample For
each SFH we measure the lookback times at which the galaxy
reaches 10 t10 50 t50 and 90 t90 of the total stellar
mass formed and the actual stellar mass at these evolutionary
stages ie accounting for the fraction of stellar mass returned
to the ISM by an evolving stellar population For quiescent
galaxies we also measure the lookback time at which each
galaxy reaches quiescence logSGyr1  2 and re-
mains quiescent for the rest of its lifetime tqui Being the
galaxies observed in the redshift range 002  z  016 we
correct all evolutionary stages for the age of the Universe at
the redshift of observation ie for all galaxies we set t  0
at z  0
We show in Figure 4 the median evolutionary stages of
all left-hand-side panel squares quiescent central panel
circles 34 of the total sample and star-forming right-
hand-side panel stars 66 of the total sample galaxies in
bins of stellar mass 02 dex wide The error bars show
the 16-to-84 percentiles of the distributions per bin In each
panel the colors indicate from light to dark t10 t50 t90
and tqui the latter only in the case of quiescent galaxies
In all panels we see the effect of downsizing ie high-
mass galaxies form earlier than low-mass galaxies When
including all galaxies left-hand-side panel there appear to
be a transition mass where the slope of the evolutionary stage
as a function of stellar mass changes These smooth tran-
sitions happen at  109 at t10  1095 at t50 and
 10102 Mat t90 A similar transition mass 31010 M
is suggested by Kauffmann et al 2003b to set the transition
between young low-surface-mass-density low-concentration
galaxies low stellar mass and old galaxies with high surface
mass density and high concentration high stellar mass
Quiescent galaxies central panel
in Figure 4 evolve
rapidly For example those detected with 10105 Mat ob-
servation form the bulk of the stellar mass 10 to 90 of
the total stellar mass between on average 93  11 when
12 Because of the mass completeness limits of the sample at low stellar
masses the results will be dominated by galaxies observed at z  005 while
at high stellar mass observations in the full redshift range will contribute

the stellar mass is close to the value at observation Also
the relation between the evolutionary stage and mass is steep
and do not show a strong transition as it appears when all
galaxies are included left-hand-side panel The transition
might nonetheless be hidden in the dispersion of the mea-
sured evolutionary stages which is large for quiescent galax-
ies possibly because quiescent galaxies are likely merger
remnants holding complex SFHs This suggests that the pos-
sible time at which galaxies shut off their star formation cov-
ers a large range in lookback time at all masses Also we
would expect to nd median quiescence times tqui older
than 3 Gyr for high-mass galaxies eg Williams et al 2009
Brammer et al 2011 Whitaker et al 2013 In this analysis
we are not considering that the transitory SSFR between star-
forming blue galaxies and quiescent red-sequence galaxies
evolve with redshift According to Fumagalli et al 2014 see
also Whitaker et al 2012 and Karim et al 2011 the SFR of
star forming and quiescent galaxies increases by about 10
times between z  05  5 Gyr and 2  102 Gyr at
all stellar masses Thus the transitory SSFR increases by the
same amount For simplicity we do not include this variation
in the calculation of tqui and we keep the transitory SSFR
xed at S  001 Gyr1 This is the reason why we do
not observe large tqui at the highest masses We will take
this detail into account in the next paper when we will com-
Timing the evolution of local galaxies
pare the results of this work with the predictions from differ-
ent cosmological simulations It is interesting to note a small
population of low-mass quiescent galaxies central panel of
Figure 4 M  109M 226 galaxies that are most likely
post-starburst galaxies To conrm their nature an analysis
of the spectroscopic features of these galaxies would be re-
quired We will investigate this in Paper III
McDermid et al 2015 nd similar results to ours using a
different technique to analyse the spectra of 260 nearby early-
type galaxies from the ATLAS3D survey Similarly to what
we nd in this work they conrm that low-mass galaxies have
more extended SFHs and as a result are younger than more
massive galaxies The most massive galaxies in our sample
described in Section 2 form half of the total stellar mass
in about 45 Gyr while according to McDermid et al 2015
galaxies with stellar masses larger than 10110Massuming
a correction of  03 dex from dynamical to stellar masses
Taylor et al 2010 form faster and reach 50 of their stel-
lar mass in less than 2 Gyr This discrepancy could be at-
tributed to the differences in the selection of the samples dif-
ferent criteria to select quiescent and early-type galaxies and
also to the large dispersion we observe in the estimates of
t50 at large stellar masses With respect to low-mass galax-
ies we nd our results in agreement with the estimates by
McDermid et al 2015 ie
that galaxies with stellar masses
between 109 and 1095Mform half of their stellar mass in
about 8 Gyr
Star-forming galaxies right-hand-side panel in Figure 4
evolve slower compared to quiescent galaxies forming the
bulk of their stellar mass between on average 83  08 when
the stellar mass is  1096 M and 15  07 Gyr when
the stellar mass is very close to the stellar mass at observa-
tion The dispersions of the measured evolutionary stages
are smaller than in the case of quiescent galaxies At 109
at t10 1095 at t50 and 1010Mat t90 we can observe
mild changes in the slopes of the evolutionary stages sug-
gesting a difference in the SFHs of low-mass and high-mass
star-forming galaxies Pacici et al 2013 This change in
slope is larger when considering all galaxies left-hand-side
panel in Figure 4 This is caused by the relative proportion
of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in different stellar mass
bins At low stellar masses  1095M 88 of the galaxies
are classied as star-forming while at higher stellar masses
 1011M this fraction drops to 40
With this analysis we quantify the galaxy evolutionary
stages and we nd that galaxies with the same stellar mass
can evolve in different ways eg the evolutionary stages of
quiescent and star-forming galaxies of the same stellar mass
happen at different lookback times Environment and mor-
phology can be among the causes for the different evolution-
ary paths We will investigate these options in Papers IV and
The results presented here have been obtained without in-
cluding measurements in J H and K photometric bands be-
cause these are available only for the brightest galaxies Be-
fore proceeding we need to quantify how much information
we are missing by not tting to these near-infrared bands We
thus measure the evolutionary stages of the 109238 galax-
ies for which 2MASS magnitudes are available by tting to
10 photometric bands F U V  N U V  g r i z J H K
and W 1 and we compare them with the measurements ob-
tained without including 2MASS We nd that for galaxies
with logMM  108 the two results compare well with
each other Above that stellar mass star-forming galaxies still
compare well while quiescent galaxies reach 50 and 90
of their stellar mass about 3 Gyr earlier than what is mea-
sured without including 2MASS magnitudes in the ts This
discrepancy affects about 15 of the galaxies in the sam-
ple massive quiescent galaxies Reasons for this difference
might be related to the actual need of 2MASS observations
to properly constrain the SFHs of the most massive galaxies
or to the way 2MASS photometry is extracted for the reddest
galaxies 2MASS apertures are in same cases twice as large as
SDSS apertures or a combination of the two A deeper anal-
ysis is not crucial for the present paper but we will investigate
it further in the next work
The evolutionary stages we here measure from observa-
tions can be compared to the predictions by cosmological
simulations to assess whether such simulations can repro-
duce the observed quantities and also to identify the mech-
anisms that cause the variations in the timescales at differ-
ent stellar masses and star-formation activity As an exam-
ple we calculate the same evolutionary stages as in Figure 4
from the original SFHs predicted by the semi-analytic model
of De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 Figure 5 In practice we ob-
serve the model galaxies at random redshifts between 002
and 016 We build model SEDs by applying the same stel-
lar gas and dust prescriptions as explained in Section 31 We
then apply the same selection criteria and instrumental limits
as we did for the observed sample see Section 213 Finally
we can derive the evolutionary timescales t10 t50 and t90
for the selected model galaxies plotted in Figure 5 We nd
that the relation between the evolutionary stages and stellar
mass is similar to what we derive from the data ie massive
galaxies are older than low-mass galaxies Also we nd that
the difference in evolution between star-forming and quies-
cent galaxies is similar to what is observed quiescent galax-
ies central panel in Figure 5 evolve faster than star-forming
galaxies right-hand-side panel in Figure 5 The differences
we nd between the model predictions and what we observe
from the data appear to be in the absolute values of the evolu-
tionary stages Model galaxies tend to form faster than what
we observe at all masses Adjustments in some parameters
of the models eg the strength of feedback mechanisms and
the star-formation efciency could reduce these differences
We note that the use of different cosmological parameters in
the simulations eg using the WMAP or Planck results does
not lead to any notable difference in the model SFHs pri-
vate communication with Aldo Rodrguez-Puebla in reference
to Rodrguez-Puebla et al 2016 and thus cannot explain the
difference between the measured and predicted evolutionary
timescales We do not go into the details of the comparison
here In Paper II we will explore the causes of the difference
between the observational data and the model predictions and
extend the comparison to other cosmological simulations
42 Tracks
In Section 41 we have shown that the galaxies in the ob-
served sample described in Section 2 experience different
histories of formation depending on the stellar mass at the
time of observation Low-mass galaxies evolve slower than
high-mass galaxies Such differences in the SFHs generate
differences in the colors of the galaxies at the time of ob-
servation We here explore the best-estimate rest-frame dust-

nitude cut in the N U V band at 24 mag

according to cuts in specic SFR The shade shown in the top-left panel
from red to blue represents the increasing of the specic SFR Quiescent
galaxies logSGyr1  2 show N U V  g colors larger than 25

Figure 6 shows the N U V  g versus g  i rest-frame dust-
corrected colors of all the galaxies in the sample in grey in all
four panels The shades represent the current best-estimate
specic SFR increasing from red to blue The border between
quiescent and star-forming galaxies logSGyr1  2
corresponds to a N U V  g color of about 25 red horizontal
dashed line We thus conrm that the N U V  g color is a
good tracer of specic SFR Less than 1 of the galaxies in
the sample show N U V  g  25 and specic SFRs indi-
cating quiescence These are all low-mass galaxies for which
the constraints look poor Degeneracies among the parame-
ters age SFR dust attenuation and metallicity are probably
causing the t to choose extreme solutions
In Figure 7 we show the same color-color measurements
as in Figure 6 with the shades representing the shape of the
SFHs To quantify the shape of each best-estimate SFH we
calculate the ratio between the average SFR at t90 SFR90
and the average SFR at t50 SFR50 The SFRs are aver-
aged over 06 Gyr around each evolutionary-stage value ie
t 03 Gyr If the ratio SFR90SFR50 is larger than 1 the SFH
is likely rising as a function of time If instead the ratio is
smaller than 1 the SFH is likely a declining function of time
This is of course an approximation of the behavior of galax-
ies along their histories given that galaxies do not necessar-
ily evolve smoothly following rising or declining functions
The presence of strong bursts of star formation can mimic
SFR90SFR50 ratios that are not fully representative of a
smooth rising or declining evolution However with the large
number statistics we have we observe trends in SFR90SFR50
ratio in the color-color plane This suggests that despite galax-

between the SFRs at t90 SFR90 and at t50 SFR50 An empirical de-
marcation line curved red dashed line see text for details is dened to
distinguish galaxies with small and large SFR90SFR50 The horizontal red
dashed line is the same as the one in Figure 6 The percentages of galaxies in
each region are also shown
Timing the evolution of local galaxies
ies are not necessarily characterized by smooth rising or de-
clining functions the shapes of the SFHs can be reasonably
quantied by the SFR90SFR50 ratio Figure 7 shows that
galaxies with similar SFR90SFR50 are characterised by sim-
ilar colors We dene a purely empirical demarcation line be-
tween the two regimes as N U V  g  05  g  i36  03
red curved dashed line galaxies described by rising SFHs
tend to occupy the region above the line 48 of all galax-
ies while those described by declining SFHs appears to be
located below the line 52 of all galaxies It is interesting
to note that 3 of the galaxies in the sample are classied
as quiescent but show a rising SFH These are most likely
post starburst galaxies that experience a very rapid quenching
of the star formation These objects are extremely interesting
and will be studied in detail in Paper III In particular we will
include spectroscopic constraints such as Balmer absorption
and D4000 measurements to estimate the age of the last burst
of star formation with higher precision
In Figure 8 we show again the same color-color values as
in the previous two gures The shades here represent the
time difference between t90 ie the lookback time at which
a galaxy reaches 90 of the total stellar mass formed and tqui
ie the lookback time at which a galaxy that is not forming
stars at observation reaches quiescence In the case of star-
forming galaxies tqui is always 0 as the galaxies have not
reached quiescence yet Green to red shades represent long
t90  tqui ie the declining of star formation is happening
slowly Blue and purple shades represent short t90  tqui
ie the quenching of star formation is a fast process The red
dashed lines are the same as in Figure 7 It is important to note
that this time difference cannot be interpreted as a quenching
time because galaxies with a declining SFH as in Figure 7
where SFR90SFR50 1 start switching off their star forma-
tion before reaching t90 thus t90  tqui is only a fraction of
the real quenching time Nevertheless we nd that the dif-
ference between t90 and tqui which we measure accurately
can already help distinguish galaxies on the N U V  g versus
g  i diagram Long time differences are observed for most of
the quiescent galaxies The quiescent galaxies above the red
dashed lines 3 of the sample show instead very short time
differences supporting the idea that these galaxies might be
post-starburst galaxies
In the small panels of Figure 8 we show the best-estimate
SFHs of two example galaxies from the sample observed in
the quiescent region of the plot N U V g  25 and on sep-
arate sides of the empirical curve introduced in Figure 7 red
dashed curve The evolution of the two tracks in color-color
space are represented on top of the small colored dots We
observe that the black SFH is bell-shaped and fairly smooth
left-hand side small panel This galaxy slowly become qui-
escent between lookback time t  5 Gyr and t  3 Gyr
Before observation the black track moves briey back to the
star-forming region because of a quick event of star formation
and moves then back to quiescence by the time of observation
The gray SFH right-hand side small panel is more bursty
than the black one It evolves as a rising function of time and
drops fast in the last Gyr The gray track in the color-color
diagram is very similar to the black track for most of the his-
tory and moves on a different path only in the last Gyr to end
in the top quiescent left-hand short t90  tqui side of the
digram
From the evidences shown in Figure 8 we could con-
clude that a UV-optical color-color diagram Yi et al 2005
Williams et al 2009Arnouts et al 2013 can help distinguish
between galaxies that quench rapidly their star formation like
the gray track and galaxies that slowly transition from star
forming to quiescent like the black track as suggested also
by Schawinski et al 2014 where quiescent galaxies are di-
vided between early-type fast-quencher and late-type slow-
quencher using morphological indicators We have to point
out however that the uncertainties on the rest-frame dust-
corrected colors shown in Figure 6 are of the order of or
larger than the difference between the tracks 02-03 dex
Such uncertainties must be taken into account when assessing
the tracks of galaxies on a rest-frame dust-corrected color-
color diagram More observations especially spectroscopic
observations can help reduce the uncertainties and allow us
to draw better conclusions on the path galaxies take to move
from the blue cloud to the red sequence
5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
Assessing the characteristics of the SFHs of individual
galaxies is key to understanding the processes that are respon-
sible for the formation and evolution of galaxies major and
minor mergers gas accretion feedback processes The com-
bination of photometric and spectroscopic observations and
realistic physically motivated models of the spectral energy
distributions of galaxies allows us to shed some light onto
such processes and quantify their relative importance along
the histories of galaxies
In this Paper we use our comprehensive spectral library
of galaxies including physically motivated SFHs from cos-
mological simulations and state-of-the-art models of the light
from stars and gas and the attenuation by dust to inter-
pret photometric observations GALEX SDSS and WISE
of 231894 galaxies at redshifts 002  z  016 For each
galaxy we derive best-estimate realistic SFHs and we ana-
lyze their characteristics in terms of shape and evolutionary
stages In particular we derive the lookback times at which
each galaxy reaches 10 50 and 90 of the total stellar mass
formed The uncertainties on these measurements are  1
08 and 03 Gyr respectively
We nd the following
 Low-mass galaxies appear to have more extended SFHs
than high-mass galaxies in agreement with what we
see also in simulations eg De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
Lee  Yi 2013
 When considering all galaxies there appear to be a tran-
sition mass at  1010 M above which the slope of the
evolutionary stages as a function of mass gets steeper
This change in slope is milder when considering only
quiescent or only star-forming galaxies thus it is in part
caused by the relative proportion of quiescent and star-
forming galaxies in different stellar mass bins
 Galaxies observed as quiescent evolve rapidly and for
 10105 Mat observation form the bulk of the stellar
mass 10 to 90 of the total stellar mass between on
average 93  11 and 42  20 Gyr
 Galaxies observed as star-forming at the same stel-
lar mass evolve slower compared to quiescent galax-
ies and form the bulk of their stellar mass between on
average 83  08 and 15  07 Gyr
 On a UV-optical color-color diagram rest-frame dust-
corrected magnitudes galaxies with different SFH
Pacici et al
shapes occupy different regions Quiescent galaxies are
located above N U V  g  25 Galaxies characterized
by rising SFHs ie the SFR keeps growing from for-
mation to observation are located above the empirical
function N U V  g  05  g  i36  03 that
roughly divides the color-color sequence in half We
nd a small population 3 of the observed sample of
post-starburst galaxies that are quiescent but show ris-
ing SFHs
 Galaxies that shut off the star formation slowly or fast
follow different tracks on a UV-optical color-color di-
agram The differences between such tracks are how-
ever of the order of the uncertainties on the rest-frame
dust-corrected colors thus we need spectroscopic ob-
servations to reduce the uncertainties before being able
to draw strong conclusions
This Paper opens doors to many further studies of the SFHs
of individual galaxies Firstly we can compare the derived
evolutionary stages with predictions from different cosmolog-
ical simulations Such comparison will help calibrate the pa-
rameters of cosmological simulations eg feedback and star-
formation efciency relative importance of mergers and gas
accretion and help generate more and more realistic mock
catalogs of galaxies Such mock catalogs can then be used to
simulate observations and best exploit current and future tele-
scopes Secondly we can explore in more detail the features
of post-starburst candidates by appealing to spectroscopic ob-
servations Thirdly we can assess the characteristics of SFHs
as a function of morphology We can identify merger events
in the SFHs and look for correlations with observed weak
and strong merger features Finally we can investigate the
relations between timescales of formation and environment
to constrain what cause certain galaxies to reach quiescence
faster than others We will address these questions in the fol-
lowing papers of the series
