Abstract
In this paper we propose an overview of the recent academic literature devoted
to the applications of Hawkes processes in nance Hawkes processes constitute
a particular class of multivariate point processes that has become very popular in
empirical high frequency nance this last decade After a reminder of the main
denitions and properties that characterize Hawkes processes we review their main
empirical applications to address many dierent problems in high frequency nance
Because of their great exibility and versatility we show that they have been suc-
cessfully involved in issues as diverse as estimating the volatility at the level of
transaction data estimating the market stability accounting for systemic risk con-
tagion devising optimal execution strategies or capturing the dynamics of the full
order book
1 Introduction
The availability of high frequency nancial data during the last decades allowed the
empirical nance to devise and calibrate models of market microstructure aiming
at accounting for the intraday market dynamics in its nest details Until recently
there were only few continuous time models for the high frequency price variations
Most approaches relied on discrete time models that consist either in aggregating
the dynamics on intervals of a regular time grid or in considering the succession of
discrete time events like trades these models are generally referred to as trading
time or business time models Hasbrouck 36 Engle and Russel 28 in the
nineties were the rst to advocate that the modeling of nancial data at the trans-
action level could be advantageously done within the framework of continuous time
point processes Since then point processes applications to nance is an ongoing
very active topic in the econometric literature We refer the reader to the recent
review of Bowens and Hautsch 9 on this subject
The rst type of point processes proposed in the context of market microstructure
is the ACD model introduced by Engle and Russel 28 This model and its variants
remains by far the most used model in high frequency econometrics 9 In this
class of models the process is dened by the means of its hazard function that
species the conditional law of inter-event or duration intervals However point
processes or counting processes can alternatively be represented by their intensity
function that represents the conditional probability density of the occurrence of an
event in the immediate future see eg 22 for a comprehensive textbook on point
process mathematical properties
In a pioneering work Bowsher 15 recognized the exibility and the advantages
of using the class of multivariate counting processes that can be specied by a
conditional intensity vector More specically he introduced a bivariate Hawkes
processes in order to model the joint dynamics of trades and mid-price changes of
the NYSE Hawkes processes is a class of multivariate point processes that were
introduced in the seventies by AG Hawkes 37 38 notably to model the occurrence
seismic events They involve an intensity vector that is a simple linear function
of past events see eg
10 9 for other examples of dynamical intensity point
processes Hawkes models are becoming more and more popular in the domain of
high frequency nance This popularity can be explained above all by their great
simplicity and exibility as anticipated by Bowsher 15 These models can easily
account for the interaction of various types of events for the inuence of some
intensive factors through marks or for the existence of non-stationarities They
are amenable to statistical inference and closed-form formulae can be obtained in
some particular situations Moreover since their parameters have a straightforward
interpretation notably through the cluster representation they lead to a quite
simple interpretation of many aspects of the complex dynamics of modern electronic
markets
In this paper we propose a survey of recent academic studies using Hawkes
processes in the context of nance As we already explained there are many such
studies In order to present them in relation one to each other we had to group them
by themes Of course the boundaries of these themes are unclear eg some of
the studies belong to several themes so the choices we have made are unavoidably
somewhat arbitrary However we believe it helps capturing the picture of Hawkes
models in nance
This survey is organized as follows Sec 2 is devoted to the theory of Hawkes
processes It introduces the main denitions and the general properties that will be
used all along the paper The following Sections focus on the applications of Hawkes
processes to nance Sec 3 starts with the main univariate models that can be found
in the literature That includes market activity or risk models eg 1-dimensional
market order ow models extreme return models Price models mid-price or best
limit price are presented in Sec 4 whereas Sec 5 is devoted to impact models
In this Section we do not only discuss the inuence of market order ows on price
moves but also the problems related to optimal execution Models that involve more
order ows are presented in Sec 6 So-called level-I models ie dealing only with
the dynamics of the best limits as well full order book models are discussed Finally
various studies that did not clearly t in any of the previous Sections are presented
in Sec 7 eg
systemic risk models high-dimensional models or news models
More materials can be found in Appendices In Appendix A all the academic works
that are discussed throughout our paper and which involves numerical experiments
on nancial data is listed in a single table This table summarizes some essential
characteristics of the models and data used in each work Finally two Appendices
sum up the main results about simulation App B and estimation App C of
Hawkes processes
2 The Hawkes process
As mentioned in the introduction Hawkes processes are a class of multivariate point
processes introduced by Hawkes in the early seventies 37 38 that are characterized
If Nt is a vector of counting processes1 at time
by a stochastic intensity vector
t then its intensity vector t is dened heuristically as see eg 22 for a rigorous
denition
t  lim
0
1Ecid2 Nt  Ntcid12cid12Ftcid3
where the ltration Ft stands for the information available up to but not including
time t In the case of Hawkes processes t is simply a linear function of past jumps
of the process as specied thereafter
21 Denition
We consider a D-variate counting-process Nt  N i
vector is denoted as t  i
Denition 1 Hawkes process A Hawkes process is a counting-process Nt such
that the intensity vector can be written as
i1 whose associated intensity
t  i 
Dcid88i1cid90 dN j
tcid48ijt  tcid48 
where the quantity   iD
ijtD
ij1 is a matrix-valued kernel such that
i1 is a vector of exogenous intensities and t 
 It is component-wise positive ie ijt  0 for each 1  i j  D
 It is component-wise causal if t  0 ijt  0 for each 1  i j  D
 Each component ijt belongs to the space of L1-integrable functions2
Notation 1 Convolution We can adopt a more compact notation so to rewrite
Eq 2 as
t      dNt 
by dening the  operation corresponding to a matrix multiplication in which ordi-
nary products are replaced by convolutions
Notation 2 Event times By introducing the couples tm kmM
m1  where tm
denotes the time of event number m and km  1  D indicates its component
Eq 2 can also be rewritten as
t  i 
Mcid88m1
ikm t  tm 
Fig 1 shows as an example a specic realization of a multivariate Hawkes process
Even though the process dened by Eq 2 is well-dened by any choice of kernel
t satisfying the three conditions stated above the stationary case characterized
below is of particular relevance in most of the applications of Hawkes processes to
nance see Sec 22 for some notable exceptions
increasing By convention N0  0
1A counting process is a stochastic process Ntt0 with values that are positive integer and
2Strictly speaking this denition only calls for ijt  L1
loc but this is of no interest for this paper
Figure 1 A realization of a multivariate Hawkes process The dots represent
individual events while the dierent rows refer to dierent i coordinates
Proposition 1 Stationarity The process Nt has asymptotically stationary incre-
ments and t is asymptotically stationary if the kernel satises the assumption also
referred to as the stability condition
H The matrix   ijD
ij1 has spectral radius smaller than 1
Notation 3 Spectral radius Here and in the following parts of the discussion
given a a scalar function f t we denote with the symbol f its L1-norm dened
radius Finally for a matrix of functions F t  f ijtD
ij1 we will write F 
f ijD
as cid82 dtf t For a matrix F  f ij the notation F will denote its spectral
From now on we will always consider unless specied that assumption H
holds and that the Hawkes processes are in the asymptotically stationary regime In
particular the averages taken in the stationary state will be denoted with E     
while the variances will be written as V      The consequences of the stationarity
assumption H will be fully explored in the next subsection Here we will rst
provide a simple implementation of a Hawkes process whose prototypical version is
the one in which the kernel functions ijt are exponential functions
Example 1 Exponential kernel Consider a bivariate Hawkes process in which
i1i2i3iD05101520Timet12345Nitthe kernel matrix has the form3
t cid18 st ct
ct st cid19
where the kernel components have the exponential form
sct  scscesct1
tR 
where 1x is an indicator function equal to 1 if x is true and zero otherwise The
above functions are L1-integrable so that the choice sc sc  0 ensures that
the associated Hawkes process is well-dened For the process to be stable one needs
to additionally require that the spectral norm satises   s  c  1
0 sct the stability condition becomes
Due to sc cid82 
s  c  1 
The sc parameters can be interpreted as the ones setting the overall strength
of the interactions while the sc control the relaxation time of the perturbations
induced from past to future events
The Hawkes process with exponential kernels has several advantageous proper-
ties as it allows one to compute the expected value of arbitrary functions of Nt
see Sec 234 and Ref 29 to be directly simulated see App B or to compute
eciently its likelihood see App C1 Most of these properties descend from a
Markov property which in its simplest form is stated as follows
Proposition 2 Markov property for exponential kernels Consider a Hawkes pro-
cess with exponential kernels ijt  ijet1
tR Then the couple Nt t is a
Markov process In particular Eq 2 for the intensity t can be recast in Markovian
form as
dt  t dt   dNt
This property can be extended to the case in which i the coecients ij are
non-constant across components and ii the kernel  contains a nite sum of ex-
ponentials The price to pay in this more general setting is the introduction of an
a1 suitably chosen so that the resulting
extra set of A auxiliary processes a
A  1-uple Nt 1
     A
 is Markovian
In the non-exponential case the Hawkes process cannot be generally mapped to a
Markovian process implying that it is necessary to take track of all its past history
in order to perform exact simulation and estimation A particularly well-known
example of a non-exponential kernel is the power-law one proposed in Ref 59 in
order to describe temporal clusters of seismic activity
Example 2 Power-law kernel Lets now consider the case D  1 and assume
the kernel to be parameterized by the regularized power-law
t 
1  t1
3The upperscript s resp c stands for the word self resp cross since it describes the self-
resp cross- excitation of the two components
Also in this case the process is well-dened for    0 The stationarity condition
in is met for
   
indicating that the tail exponent  of a power law-kernel should be positive for the
increments of the process to be stationary
22 Some extensions
Although the model dened in above section is the one originally introduced in 37
38 and most widely used in the literature several generalizations have been pro-
posed since
221 Marked Hawkes processes
Eq 4 dening the Hawkes process can be enriched by endowing each event with
a mark variable thus obtaining a sequence of event times components and marks
tm km mM
m1 One may further assumes events labeled with dierent marks
to have dierent eects on the future intensities leading to a dynamics for t of the
t  i 
ikm t  tm m 
Mcid88m1
Finally one needs to introduce a generating mechanism for the marks which are
typically assumed to be iid random variables drawn with each event and sampled
from a common distribution p A typical choice for the interaction kernel is the
one ijt   ijtij in which one assumes a factorized form for the eect
of the marks This mechanism is used to describe events of dierent weights and
has been originally employed in order to model the occurrence of earthquakes of
dierence magnitudes 59 In nance marks can be used in order to model trades
performed at times tm with dierent volumes m as eg in 30 5 see Sec 4 and
5 or a drawdown intensity as eg
in 27 18 see Sec 31 On a more general
ground note that multivariate Hawkes processes can also be seen as an example of
Hawkes processes with interacting marks 51
222 Exogenous non-stationarity
The exogenous intensity  can be generalized to a deterministic function of time
t This choice allows to model a non-stationary system in which the interaction
kernel is indeed independent of time In nance this is the case when one wants
to model intra-day seasonalities see the review article 9 andor spillover eects
within successive days as in 15
223 Endogenous non-stationarity
The scenarios   1 and   1 have also been considered in order to model
non-stationarity induced by endogenous interactions These two cases present in-
deed an important dierence while in the former one the average intensity grows
exponentially in time in the latter one the process may possess a nite average event
rate This second type of non-stationarity which we will call quasi-stationarity has
raised a strong interest in the literature due to the fact that the condition   1
is often met when calibrating Hawkes processes to real nancial data see the de-
tailed discussion in Sec 3 The limiting behavior of a Hawkes process in the regime
  1 has been analyzed by Bremaud and Massoulie in 17 where it is shown in
particular that
Proposition 3 Degeneracy of critical short-range Hawkes Let Nt be a univariate
Hawkes process as in Eq 2 such that   1 and   0 Then if
cid90 
dt t t  
the average of the conditional intensity is either 0 or 
Hence in the D  1 case short-ranged kernels always lead to trivial processes
The next result shows instead that interactions of broader range allow instead a
richer behavior
Theorem 1 Existence of critical stationarity Lets now consider a Hawkes pro-
cess with   1   0 and
t1t  R
t1t  r
t
where r R  0 and   0 12 Then the average intensity of such process is nite
Summarizing there exist non-trivial univariate Hawkes processes with   1
only for specic values of the tail exponent of t which is required to lie in the
interval   0 12
Notice that even though in D  1 a quasi-stationary short-ranged Hawkes
process is always degenerate Ref 42 describes a scaling regime for Nt in which it is
possible to obtain to a non-degenerate process in the limit   1 by appropriately
choosing an observation timescale for the process This behavior will be reviewed in
Sec 236
In the multivariate setting Ref 51 shows that even in presence of kernels  sat-
isfying the short-range condition Eq 12 it is possible to dene a non-trivial quasi-
stationary Hawkes process in the large-dimensional limit
In particular Ref 51
assumes a factorized form of the kernel of the type
ijt  ijf t 
with f  1 and consider the D   limit of the process Nt Such a limiting
regime turns out to be well-dened also when    D
1 provided that
the matrix  has a suciently low density of eigenvalues in the vicinity of the
critical point   1 Hence a non-degenerate quasi-stationary limit for a Hawkes
process can also be obtained as an eect of the interaction among a large number
of components
224 Non-linear Hawkes
Non-linear generalizations of the Hawkes process have been considered by several
authors 16 65 62 69 The intensity function in the non-linear case is written as
t  hcid32i 
Dcid88i1cid90 dN j
tcid48ijt  tcid48cid33 
where h is a non-linear function with support in R Typical choices for h include
hx  1
xR and hx  ex Note that the stability condition for various functions
h was studied by Bremaud and Massoulie in 16 The main advantage introduced
by this extension is the possibility of modeling inhibition through negative valued
kernels although the price that has to be paid is the loss of mathematical tractability
for most of the properties of the process Yet simulation and calibration of the model
are possible even in this scenario 33 8 As we will see negative valued kernels are
found in the context of nance see for instance Sec 61
Let us end this section by mentioning that we have only referred to the most
common extensions of Hawkes original model but many further generalizations have
been proposed like eg mixed diusion-Hawkes models 29 18 Hawkes models
with shot noise exogenous events 23 Hawkes processes with generation dependent
kernels 53
23 Properties
The linear structure of the stochastic intensity t of a Hawkes process allows us to
characterize many of its properties in a completely analytical manner Notably its
rst- and second-order properties are particularly easy to compute while a cluster
representation of the process can be used in order to obtain a useful characterization
of the Hawkes process These properties are reviewed in the following Section
231 First and second order properties
Assuming the hypothesis H it is then possible to write explicitly the rst- and
the second-order properties of the model in term of the Laplace transform of the
kernel  In order to do this it is necessary to introduce the function  dened as
follows
Denition 2 Kernel inversion Consider a Hawkes process Nt with stationary
increments We dene t as the causal solution of the equation
As a consequence of H t exists and can be expressed as the innite convolution
t  t  t  t
t  t  t  t  t  t  t    
The matrix function  can be characterized analytically in term of the Laplace
transform of the kernel  which we dene as follows
Notation 4 Laplace transform Given a scalar function f t  L1  we
denote its Laplace transform as
dt f tezt
f z cid90 
Vector and matrix Laplace transforms are dened by applying the above transforma-
tion component-wise
In the Laplace domain Eq 18 is then mapped to the algebraic relation
z  I  z1  I 
where I denotes the identity matrix allowing us to state the main result concerning
the linear properties of a Hawkes process
Proposition 4 First- and second-order statistics For a Hawkes process Nt with
stationary increments the following propositions hold
1 The average intensity   E  dNt dt is equal to
2 The Laplace transform of the linear correlation matrix
  I  0
is equal to
ct  tcid48 
Ecid2 dNtdN T
tcid48 cid3  E  dNt Ecid2 dN T
tcid48 cid3
cz  I  z  I  T z
dtdtcid48
where  is a diagonal matrix with non-zero elements equal to ii  i
This useful characterization of the linear properties of a Hawkes process rst
formulated in 37 38 and then fully generalized in 8 allows to i obtain the
linear predictions of a Hawkes model given  and  as an input ii calibrate non-
parametrically the kernel  from empirical data by inverting relations 21 and 23
see App C1
Let us point out that in Ref 4 the authors have established that under general
conditions the empirical covariation of a multivariate Hawkes process converges
towards its expected value that can be easily expressed in terms of the Hawkes
covariance matrix ct as given by Eq 23
Example 3 Exponential kernel Lets consider again the bivariate case described
by Eq 5 in the stationary case 1  s  c In that case the Laplace transform
of the kernel z reads
z

implying that the kernel matrix is diagonal in the symmetric and antisymmetric
combinations Nt  212N 1

components of the kernel is
t  N 2
z

and due to the diagonal form of Eq 5 the inverse kernel z can be computed
straightforwardly If one assumes   0 0 then the relations above imply that
  0 0 with

symmetric combinations Xt dened as

Note that a singular component arises for t  0 due to the assumption of unitary
jumps dN 2  dN  Above formula also shows that by moving the spectral norm
  s  c close to the instability point   1 the decay of the symmetric
mode of correlation function becomes slower and slower Fig 2 illustrates the result
above for the autocorrelation function of the modes Nt 
Figure 2 Autocorrelation function left and normalized variance right of the

have used the parameter set s  0 c  01 0  0  1 in order to simulate
a single realization of the process of length T  105 For such a value of T  the
theoretical predictions dashed lines are almost exactly superimposed to the results
of the simulations The t component in the cross-covariance function has been
omitted in the left panel for the sake of clarity

interaction kernel in dimension D  1 For a kernel parameterized by Eq 9 the

As shown in Sec 21 in this case the spectral radius  is equal to    0

For a xed value of the exogenous intensity  this relation interpolates between a
total intensity equal to the exogenous one in the non-interacting case   0 and
an increasingly larger number of events as soon as  approaches the instability point
  
The Laplace transform of the lagged cross-correlation matrix results

The above expression cannot be inverted analytically One can indeed relate the
tail behavior of the correlations to the small z behavior of cz thanks to Tauberian
Theorems In particular for t cid29 1 one has

This behavior is illustrated in Fig 3 where we compare the autocorrelation function
of several univariate Hawkes processes with power-law kernel and dierent tail ex-
ponents As a nal note we remark that for   12 and close to the instability
point    the function ct obeys an intermediate asymptotics ct  t21 which
holds as long as
t cid28cid18 1  
  1cid191
In this particular regime the Hawkes process develops an apparent Hurst exponent
H  12   This limiting behavior is a consequence of the quasi-stationarity
condition   1 analyzed in Ref 17 and reviewed in Sec 223
232 Characterization through second order statistics
This section justies why the Hawkes process can be thought of as the simplest
example of an interacting point process In fact it is entirely characterized by its
rst- and second-order properties means and correlations uniquely determine a
Hawkes process through the solution of a Wiener-Hopf system
Figure 3 Comparison of the autocorrelation function for a set of univariate Hawkes
processes with power-law kernels parametrized by Eq 9 We used the values
    1   09  and simulated processes of length T  5  105 for   025
and 05 T  106 for   1 and T  5106 for   2 in order to obtain the curves
represented in the plot The image illustrates the crossover from the exponential
decay of correlation obtained for   1 to the power-law behavior detected for
  1
Let us start by dening the conditional intensity matrix gt that we dene for
t  0 as
gijt 
Ecid104 dN i

Then one can prove straightforwardly 8 from Eq 23 that
tcid12cid12dN j

t  0
ct  gT t

which relates conditional averages and lagged cross-correlations Hence by using
Eq 37 and 23 one can prove that 8
Theorem 2 Wiener-Hopf equation Consider a Hawkes process dened by Eq 1
satisfying the stationarity assumption H Then the matrix function t  t is
the unique solution of the Wiener-Hopf system
gt  t  t  gt t  0
such that the components ijt are causal and ijt  L1 i j
This property implies that when xing an average intensity vector  and a
conditional expectation gt there exist at most one Hawkes process consistent with
11010001110100EdNtdN0dt22tAuto-correlation2105025these observables Indeed such a process is not always guaranteed to exist as a
Hawkes process doesnt necessarily reproduce the linear properties for systems in
which inhibition is relevant
This result is the inverse one with respect to the one expressed by Eq 23
while that equation expresses the fact that by xing a kernel t and an exogenous
intensity  the correlations are uniquely determined the theorem above states that
correlations and average intensities uniquely x the interactions While the direct
result was rst proved in 37 the converse was shown in 8 by using the Wiener-
Hopf factorization technique
Finally note that the Wiener-Hopf system 38 is very useful in applications to
empirical data as it allows us to estimate non-parametrically the interaction kernel
of a Hawkes process given a set of empirical observations see App C2
233 Auto-regressive projection
A Hawkes process with stationary increments can always be linearly approximated
by suitably dened auto-regressive processes In particular one can show that 51
Proposition 5 Auto-regressive projection Consider a Hawkes process Nt dened
by Eq 2 satisfying the stationarity assumption H Then the convolution N AR
dened by
 It  t   t  12Wt 
where t is the innite convolution of the Hawkes kernel given by Eq 18 and
Wt is a standard D-dimensional Brownian motion satises
AR  
cARt  ct 
where  and c denote respectively the average intensity and the lagged cross-correlation
matrix of Nt
Hence it is always possible to match the rst and the second order properties
of a stationary Hawkes process with interaction kernel  by using a convolution of
Wiener processes On the other hand higher order moments cannot be matched in
the same way
234 Beyond second-order
The rst- and second-order moments are not the only moments which can be com-
puted analytically for a Hawkes process In particular Jovanovic et al 44 have
recently developed a combinatorial procedure allowing to calculate cumulants and
consequently moments of arbitrary order of a Hawkes process More precisely
given a set of components S  1     D and one of times tS  t1    tS it is
possible to dene a cumulant density of a Hawkes process as
kcid16N Scid17  dtScid88
  111 cid89Bcid42cid89iB
ticid43 
where the sum runs over all the partitions  of S  denotes their number of
blocks and B labels individually the blocks of  Above equation generalizes the
denition of the average intensity recovered for S  1 and of the lagged cross-
correlation function obtained for S  2 Moment densities can be obtained from
above expression by writing
cid42cid89iS
ticid43 dtS cid88 cid89B
kcid16N Bcid17 
Ref 44 shows how to express Eq 42 as a sum of integral terms which can be
written explicitly in terms of  and t As each of such addends can be interpreted
as a topologically distinct rooted tree with S labeled leaves the enumeration of all
the contribution to Eq 42 can be performed systematically
In the special case of a Hawkes processes with exponential kernel a useful result
is obtained by Errais et al 29 by exploiting Dynkins formula for the couple N 
in the marked framework described in Sec 221
In particular they are able to
express the generating function for the couple N  in terms of the solution of
an ordinary dierential equation While it may be necessary to solve numerically
the equation for the generating function closed-form expressions are available for
specic moments of Nt see also the work of Dassios and Zhao 23 for similar results
on a slight generalization of Hawkes processes
235 Martingale representation
The process dened by Eq 2 admits a convenient martingale representation once
Theorem 3 Martingale representation Given a Hawkes process 2 the D stochas-
tic processes
one introduces suitably dened compensators cid82 t

are martingales with respect to the canonical ltration of the process Nt 22 Ad-
ditionally under the stability condition H the stochastic intensity t admits the
representation
t   cid90 t
t  s ds cid90 t
t  s dYs 
While the above result is valid even in the non-stationary regime Eq 45 takes a
particularly simple form in the asymptotic regime of large t where it can be written
t t
 cid90 t
t  s dYs
thanks to Eq 21 The martingale property of the Hawkes process plays an impor-
tant role in determining the rst- and second-order properties discussed in above
section which are derived by means of Eq 46 in 2 8 The representation Eq 45
is also particularly useful in order perform predictions of the intensity of the Hawkes
process given an historic ltration Ft of the process

which satises the stationary condition H one is interested in computing the pre-
dictor Ecid2 tcid12cid12Fscid3 for t  s see Ref 40 41 for direct applications in Finance
While by naively applying the denition of the Hawkes processes one can obtain an
implicit equation of the type

236 Scaling limit of the process
The structure of Hawkes processes is naturally adapted to describe systems in which
the discrete nature of the jumps in the coordinates Nt is relevant making this model
especially suitable for modeling high-frequency data Indeed in many applications
one additionally needs to control the limiting behavior the system in the opposite
regime of low frequencies where the granularity of events is disregarded and the
scaling in time of Nt needs to be known
Diusion towards a Brownian motion The following results rst proved
in 4 allow us to establish that Hawkes processes under appropriate hypotheses and

Other scaling limits
It is well known that many of the microscopic observables
involved in the price formation process do not diuse at large scales eg at the
daily or even monthly time-scale toward Brownian motion dynamics For instance
the trading activity ie the market-order ow seems to be long-range dependent
14 while the volatility displays clusters that can last for months Since as we will
see in the next sections Hawkes processes tend to mimic very well the high-frequency
2020025050751T1000u202T100202T10Zu1sc0T12cid0NuTuTcid1dynamics of nancial time-series it is natural to try to understand if diusive limits
other than the one described by Theorem 5 can be found
In a recent work by
Jaisson and Rosenbaum 42 a sequence of rescaled univariate Hawkes processes
1  aT
indexed by a time-scale parameter T and where aT  0 1 is proved to converge
when T   towards an integrated Cox Ingersoll Ross process 20 under the

Hence even though a quasi-stationary short-ranged Hawkes process is always de-
generate one can detect a non-trivial behavior of the rescaled counting function by
suitably choosing an observation timescale T  1T 1 Let us point out that
the above conditions do not allow for  to have a power-law decay with an exponent
strictly smaller than 2 in the limit t   As reviewed in Sec 3 several studies
tend to show that for many nancial time-series eg market order ow time-series
the relevant kernel has power-law tails with an exponent above but rather close to 1
Thus strictly speaking the previous framework is inappropriate to describe such be-
havior Using the same asymptotics T   Jaisson 41 studied the asymptotic
limit of the correlation function of a 1-dimensional Hawkes process with a power-law
kernel which decreases with an exponent 1   with   0 12 He proved that
the auto-correlation function of the Hawkes process decreases asymptotically as a
power-law with an exponent 1  2 ie leading to a long-range dependence5
237 Clustering representation
Another useful property of the Hawkes process is the clustering property which
emerges as a consequence of the linearity of Eq 2 Such property allows one to i
build an ecient simulation algorithm for the process see App B ii introduce
the notion of parenthood among dierent events see Sec 238 below iii infer
parenthood relations among successive events from empirical data see the paragraph
about the EM method in App C2
Proposition 6 Clustering representation Consider a positive integer D and a
non-necessarily nite time interval 0 T  in which we dene a sequence of events
tm kmM
m1 according to the following procedure
 For each 1  i  D consider a set of immigrant events t0
with homogeneous Poissonian rate i in the interval 0 T 
m  iM 0

4For precise formulation of the corresponding theorem we refer the reader to 42
5Let us notice that qualitative arguments for similar result were also given in 7 in a 2-dimensional
framework
 For each immigrant event of type j labeled by t0
mcid48  j and for each 1  i  N 
m  iM 1

dependent Poissonian rate ijt  tmcid48 in the interval t0

Note that the construction above depicted in Fig 5 can be equivalently taken
as a denition for the Hawkes process once the information encoding the generation

process described above onto the one of a Galton-Watson tree with average ospring
 The qualitative behavior of the model is in fact dictated by the average number
0 t  0   The three
phases of the Hawkes process stationary   1 non-stationary   1 and
quasi-stationary   1 correspond then to the three phases of a Galton-Watson
branching process more precisely
1 For   1 we have a sub-critical phase in which each parent event generates
on average less than one child event This implies that the total progeny of
each event is as nite and the average number of generations before extinction
is as nite
2 For   1 we have a super-critical phase in which more than one child
event is generated by each parent event In that case the total progeny of a
parent event might be innite with nite probability
3 For   1 the critical case the total progeny is as nite but the total
size of the progeny has large uctuations leading to a divergence of the average
number of generations before extinction
238 Causality
The parenthood relation introduced by using the clustering representation of the
Hawkes process allows us to discuss the problem of causality in this context
particular after constructing a Hawkes process according to the branching procedure
described above one can introduce the counting functions
N i0
N ij
N ij
 Exogenously generated events of type i
 Events of type i with type j direct ancestor
 Events of type i with type j oldest ancestor
so that N i0

be used in order to express the overall number of events of type i generated by an
ancestor of a given type j In particular it is easy to prove that

The property above can be used in order to estimate the average fraction of
events directly or indirectly caused by a specic component of a Hawkes process
Alternative notions of causality for point-processes have also been investigated
In particular the notion of Granger-causality has been extended to point-processes

3 Univariate models
31 Models of market activity and risk
The rst straightforward application of Hawkes processes in high frequency nance
is probably to model the so-called volatility clustering phenomenon Since volatility
at the transaction level can be directly related to the number NT of a given type
of events trades mid-price changes that occur in a given time interval of size
T 6 the self-exciting nature of Hawkes processes provides a very simple picture that
can explain the correlated nature of volatility uctuations This idea was rst pro-
posed by Bowsher 15 who calibrated a univariate Hawkes model with mixture of
exponential kernels using intraday equity data from NASDAQ and NYSE 7
In Ref 2 Bacry et al recently introduced a non-parametric estimation method
for multivariate symmetric Hawkes processes based on the spectral factorization of
the covariance matrix by the means of the Hilbert transform By calibrating a 1-
dimensional Hawkes model to the occurrence of trades of the 10 years Euro-Bund
future front contract over 75 trading days in 2009 they discovered two important
empirical facts i the model is very close to its stability threshold   1 and
ii the empirical kernel t is very well described over a wide range of scales by
the power-law function Eq 9
t 
1  t1
with  cid39 0 The rst observation directly concerns the level of endogeneity and the
one of stability of nancial markets a problem as discussed in the next section
that has been addressed afterwards by Filimonov and Sornette or Hardiman et
al 31 32 34 35 The power-law nature of Hawkes kernels with an exponent  cid39 0
has been conrmed by studies that followed notably by Hardiman et al on mid-
price changes of E-mini SP500 futures 34 or by Bacry and Muzy on trades arrivals
of EuroStoxx index futures 8 The plots of Fig 6 are directly extracted from these
papers they represent in log-log scales the estimated Hawkes kernel for the E-mini
SP futures mid-price change events and the EuroStoxx market order occurrences
One can see that the two estimated kernels corresponding to dierent data dierent
markets and dierent estimation methods are strikingly similar This suggests some
universality of both  and C   parameters in the algebraic decay of Eq 63
The origin of this power-law behavior and in particular of the values of  and
 remains an open question Previous empirical results motivated the work by
Jaisson 41 see also Ref 7 and the section preceding Eq 35 who proved that
within a particular asymptotics which includes the L1 norm of the kernel converging
to 1 a 1-dimensional kernel with a power-law decay with an exponent 1   with
 0 05 leads to an auto-covariance function of the ow which is power-law
with an exponent 1  2 ie to a long-range dependence of the ow see also the
discussion in Sec 23 Eq 34 The algebraic decay of Hawkes kernels can then
6One can have in mind a simple price model where the price is build as the sum of independent
random shocks In this case the volatility at scale T is proportional to NT 12 The empirical results of
Ref 68 corroborate empirically this observation allowing one to establish more precisely of the relation
among impact per trade and volatility
7More precisely Bowsher considered a generalization of Hawkes processes in order to account for the
peculiar non-stationarities observed at high frequency like intraday seasonalities and overnight gaps
Figure 6 Inferred kernel t of the univariate Hawkes process describing mid-
point changes of the E-mini SP500 and for the trade arrivals of the EuroStoxx in
dierent years reproduced respectively from Refs 8 and 34 Strikingly consid-
ering the dierent markets traded contract type of events considered and periods
of time considered in these studies the shape of t is almost identical
be related to the volatility clustering properties Notice that within trading time
models 14 the long-range nature of oer and demand has been mostly explained in
terms of order splitting dynamics and is supported by empirical results such as 66
in which broker-resolved data is analyzed in order to distinguish among the herding
and splitting components of the order ow It is thus likely that the observed slowly
decreasing nature of the kernel directly results from the splitting of the meta-orders
Such an hypothesis remains however to be supported by quantitative arguments and
to be conrmed by empirical observations Beyond these fundamental questions the
power-law nature of Hawkes kernels remains a solid empirical fact which at least
calls to question all the approaches based on exponential Hawkes models
In the same lines of the previously cited studies Da Fonseca and Zaatour 21
perform a parametric estimation using a GMM approach see Sec C1 of a 1-
dimensional Hawkes process with exponential kernels of the form  expt on
unsigned market-order ow data As expected market-order clustering translates
in a rather low value for   002 01 depending on the nancial time-series and
the L1 norm of the kernel is found to be very close to criticality ie   09 and
very often  095 One can also cite the work of Lallouache and Challet 45 who
performed a maximum likelihood estimation on market orders using a sum of two
exponential functions as the Hawkes kernel They study forex EBS data which are
throttled market orders are gathered within slices of 01 seconds which calls for a
rather complex denoising preprocessing Using goodness of t tests they conclude
that though the model performs well when applied to a 1 hour specic intraday

exogenous intensity  does not allow to t well a whole day
Hawkes processes have also been used to model extreme price moves at a rather
low frequency In Ref 27 Embrechts et al study an equally weighted portfolio of
3 indices Dow Jones Nasdaq and SP on an hourly time-frame on 14 years Only
extreme quantiles of returns are kept the smallest and the largest 1 quantiles
leading to a 1-dimensional point process whose jumps correspond to an extreme
return of any of the three indices The jumps are then marked using a 3-dimensional
marks coding the excess of each index respect to the corresponding 1 quantile The
so-obtained point process is modeled using a 3-dimensional Hawkes process with
an exponential kernel marked by 3-dimensional Gamma-distributed iid random
variables A maximum likelihood estimation is performed and goodness of tests
show that this model is well suited for modeling extreme price moves Let us point
out that in the same work a very similar experiment is performed on daily log-
returns of an home-made index of stocks using this time a 2-dimensional Hawkes
process for coding positive or negative extreme jumps with 1-dimensional marks
In the same spirit in Ref 18 Chavez-Demoulin and Mc Gill constructed a model
for the excesses of an asset price above a given threshold This model combines
a Hawkes process for the excess occurrences with Pareto distributed marks to the
excess sizes Within this approach the authors goal was to describe the clustering
of large drawdown events through the self-excited dynamics of the Hawkes process
By performing backtests on equities intraday data they have shown that this model
captures very well extreme intraday events notably as compared to standard non-
parametric methods based on extreme value theory
32 Measuring the endogeneity of stock markets
In a recent series of papers 31 32 34 35 some authors addressed within the
framework of Hawkes models the important problem of the so-called volatility
puzzle namely the fact that the observed market volatility cannot be explained
by classical economic theory Indeed it is well known that prices move too much
compared to the ow of pertinent information that may impact the market This
observation naturally leads to the idea that price dynamics is highly endogenous ie
mainly driven by some internal feedback mechanisms Filimonov and Sornette 31
were the rst to propose a quantitative measure of the level of market reexivity
For that purpose they model the high frequency mid-price variations of some stock
index namely the E-mini SP500 as a 1-dimensional Hawkes process As explained
in Sec 238  can be interpreted as a branching ratio ie the number of events
generated by any parent event Each exogenous event occurring at rate  thus
generates 1 events and therefore the ratio of endogenous event rate to
the overall rate  in one dimension is according to Eq 21
cid18 
1  cid19   
This means that  provides a direct measure of the fraction of endogenous events
within the whole population of mid-price changes and thus a measure of the mar-
ket reexivity By analyzing the E-mini SP500 future contracts over the period
1998-2010 Filimonov and Sornette found that the degree of reexivity has strikingly
increased during the last decade They suggested that this eect could be directly
caused by the increasing amount of high frequency and algorithmic trading raising
the question of the impact of high frequency trading on the market stability This
analysis has been revisited by Hardiman Bercot and Bouchaud 34 who noticed
that Filimonov and Sornette estimation relying on an exponential parametrization
is biased because as discussed previously empirical evidences suggest that Hawkes
kernels have a slow power-law decay Accounting for this feature on their es-
timation of  Hardiman et al found that the reexivity of the E-mini SP
future hasnt been increasing during the last decade but has remained constant at
a value very close to the critical one   1
It is noteworthy that Hardiman
et al also provided in their study empirical evidences of the existence of a high
frequency cut-o of the Hawkes kernel namely the parameter 1 in Eq 63 that
decreases exponentially fast in time and that can be associated with the increase of
the trading frequency In a more recent paper Filimonov and Sornette 32 have
reviewed all the pitfalls associated with the estimation  in the case of a slowly
decreasing kernel They have shown that signicant biases can be induced by the
presence of outliers edge eects or non stationary eects Because some important
issues are also related to the way one parametrizes the model notably the choice of
the high-frequency regularization Hardiman and Bouchaud 35 proposed a simple
non-parametric approximation of the branching ratio  that relies on Eq 23
Indeed by considering this equation in z  0 it is possible to relate the integral of
the correlation function c0 to  The number of events NT in a window of size
T  becomes for T large enough c0 cid39 T 1V  NT  and therefore one gets
 cid39 1 cid18V  NT 
E  NT cid1912
This formula leads to a very intuitive interpretation of the degree of reexivity The
occurrence of correlated events implies an increase of the variance of NT with respect
to its mean value for a Poisson process both quantities are equal so that one directly
gets   0 Using this model free estimator Hardiman and Bouchaud 35 have
conrmed their former claims that the SP 500 future appears to have during the
last ten years a stable level of reexivity close to the criticality Let us notice
that this formula only holds for 1-dimensional Hawkes processes and has no simple
extension in the multivariate situation
Beyond the debate on the most suitable estimator for the reexivity parameter
and its genuine behavior the pioneering work of Filimonov and Sornette provided
a quantitative framework allowing to study the endogeneity of market uctuations
with Hawkes processes They notably have shown that such approach can be used
to study particular events such as the ash crashes of April and May 2010 31
Their results may be helpful to devise warning tools in order to anticipate extreme
drawdowns which are of endogenous origin The prospects and applications along
this path are numerous One important question concerns the extension of such
studies by accounting other types of events like eg order book events see Sec 6
4 Price models
Describing the uctuations of price at the nest time scales with notably the goal
of improving volatility and covariance estimations is a central issue of nancial
econometrics The notion of microstructure noise was considered by many authors
as an additional noise superimposed to the standard diusion that accounts for the
small scale behavior of the signature plot Indeed it is well know that the signature
C  
T cid88i0cid2Pi1  Picid32
that corresponds to the quadratic variation of the mid-price Pt at scale   strongly
increases when   0 see Fig 7 Along the same line the so-called Epps eect
accounts for the vanishing covariation among the returns of pairs of assets when the
return scale  goes to zero Bacry et al in 3 proposed as an alternative to standard
latent price models to directly account for the discrete nature of price variations
They have been the rst ones to describe the tick-by-tick variation of the mid-price
In order to do so these authors
Pt within the framework of Hawkes processes
considered the two counting processes N 1
t associated with respectively the
arrival times of upward and downward price changes and set
t and N 2
Pt  P0  N 1
t  N 2
t  N 2
where the couple N 1
t  is a 2-dimensional Hawkes model Since in a rst ap-
proximation the dynamics of the upward moves and of the downward moves are
expected to be the same it is natural to consider a matrix kernel  as the one con-
sidered in Eq 5 with equal diagonal terms st and anti-diagonal terms ct
It is well known that at the microstructure level the price is essentially mean re-
verting thus in 3 the authors considered the purely mean-reverting scenario
ie the case where st  0 and chose for ct an exponential shape Within
this simple framework Bacry et al provided a closed-form expression for the sig-
nature plot Calibrating the model using MLE or GMM estimations on Euro-Bund
and Euro-Bobl future data they have shown that the model is able to reproduce
the scale behavior of the signature plot see Fig 7 Bacry et al also considered
a natural extension of the previous model to a 4-dimensional Hawkes model in or-
der to describe the joint mid-price dynamics of a pair of assets and to reproduce
the Epps eect 3 Let us recall that in Ref 4 the authors established that
under general conditions the empirical covariation of a multivariate Hawkes pro-
cess converges towards its expected value that can be easily expressed in terms of
the Hawkes covariance matrix ct as given by Eq 23 This result allows one
within the Hawkes price model of Bacry et al to provide analytical expressions for
the signature plot lead-lag behavior and the Epps eect in terms of Hawkes ma-
trix kernel  3 4 Let us also mention that along the line the of previous model
in 21 the symmetric case was considered ie the purely trend following scenario
st  0 and ct exponential shape The authors compared this scenario with
the purely mean-reverting scenario when used for daily volatility estimation using
diusive formula 53 They showed that the mean-reverting resp trend-following
scenario underestimates resp over-estimates the volatility and concluded that a
full model with both cross and self terms is more realistic and should lead to better
volatility estimation Let us notice that the existence of non-negligible diagonal and
anti-diagonal terms has been conrmed by non-parametric estimations performed
thereafter in 2 7 6
One also expects the involved kernels not to be exponential functions Indeed
as shown in many works eg in Ref 2 and as discussed previously in Sec 31
empirical self-exciting kernels are closer to a power-law than to an exponential It
Figure 7 Reproducing the mid-price behavior at the microstructural level using
Bacry et al 2-dimensional Hawkes model The plots represent the Euro-Bund
empirical signature plot as compared to its t within the model of Bacry et al
The gure has been reproduced from Ref 3
is with that consideration in mind that Jaisson and Rosenbaum 42 developed the
diusive framework that we have already described in second part of Sec 236 It is
an alternative framework to the more classical Brownian motion diusive framework
developed in the rst part of the same Section In the second part of their paper
Jaisson and Rosenbaum used their framework to build a version of the 2-dimensional
Hawkes model initially introduced by 3 that converges at large scales towards the
Heston price model 39 which displays volatility clustering This work can be seen
as the very rst step towards a across scales unied model that would t both
microstructure stylized facts of price ie point process with strong mean reversion
and diusive stylized facts volatility clustering and multifractality In that sense
this is a very promising work
We can also mention a very interesting generalization of the model introduced by
Bacry et al in 3 In 69 Zheng et al introduced a model for the coupled dynamics
of the best bid and ask prices It starts by coding each best price using the Bacry et
al model leading to a 4-dimensional price model The main diculty comes from
the fact that one needs to encode in the model the fact that the ask price needs to lie
strictly above the bid price This is achieved through a spread point process whose
dynamics is coupled with the dynamics of both best prices It is used to measure the
distance in ticks between the ask price and the bid price the spread is increased
resp decreased by 1 each time either the ask resp bid component jumps upward
resp downward or the bid resp ask component jumps downward resp upward
Finally a non-linear term is introduced in the Hawkes model the intensities of the
downward resp upward jumps of the ask resp bid price are set to 0 as soon as
the spread process is equal to 1 The authors of 69 developed a whole new rigorous
framework for this constrained non-linear Hawkes model in which they were able to
establish several properties including a diusive limits They perform maximum
likelihood estimation on real data using exponential kernels and show that they
were able to reproduce rather well the signature plot
00250030035004050100150200CsecondsFittedEmpiricalLet us nally cite the work of Fauth and Tudor in 30 where the authors pro-
posed to describe bid and ask prices of an asset or a couple of assets within the
framework of marked multivariate Hawkes model Motivated by the empirical ob-
servation performed on high-frequency EuroUSD and EuroGPB FX rates from
30-01-2012 to 10-03-2012 that as the transaction volumes increase the inter-trade
durations decrease the authors proposed to consider in addition to an exponential
Hawkes kernel a multiplicative mark the function  in Sec 221 that corresponds
to a power-law function of the volumes v  Cv Their model thus describes the
events corresponding to an increasedecrease of the bidask as a four dimensional
Hawkes process marked by transaction volumes By adding suitable constraints in
order to avoid innite spread they calibrated the model on FX rates data by a
maximum likelihood approach Fauth and Tudor have shown that their model is
consistent with empirical data by reproducing the signature plots of the considered
assets and the behavior of the high-frequency pair correlation function Epps eect
Impact models
51 Market impact modeling
Market impact modeling is a longstanding problem in market microstructure lit-
erature and is obviously of great interest both for theoreticians and practitioners
see eg 13 for a recent review While for the former market impact reects the
mechanism enforcing the eciency of markets allowing prices to reect fundamental
information for the latter it represents a cost which needs to be carefully minimized
when executing an order For a trader market impact induces extra costs per trans-
action which needs to be added to the fees charged directly by the market forcing
him to split large orders and trade them incrementally in sequences of smaller child
orders Any of such sequences of orders is called a meta-order and quantifying their
eect on prices is at the heart of market-microstructure regulation discussions
The theory of market price formation and the relationship between the order ow
and price changes has made signicant progress during the last decade thanks to the
increasing availability of intraday data 14 Many empirical studies have provided
evidence that the price impact has to many respects some universal properties
and is the main source of price variations This corroborates the picture of an
endogenous nature of price uctuations that contrasts with the classical scenario
according to which an exogenous ow of information drives the prices towards a
fondamental value 14
If a meta-order is placed at time t  0 and executed until time t  T  an
associated market impact curve can be dened by a proxy of the price variation it
directly or indirectly causes8 One generally distinguishes two phases an increasing
concave part during the execution of the meta-order ie on the interval 0 T 
followed by a decaying generally convex resilient part The existence of permanent
impact ie a non zero asymptotic value for large time of the market impact curve
is a central problem that remains under debate The typical shape of a market
impact curve is shown in Fig 8 that was was obtained by Bacry et al in 5 by
averaging empirical impact curves over a large database of broker meta-orders Let
8We focus here on the impact of meta-orders rather than with the impact of individual orders or
with the one of trade imbalance which have also received considerable interest in the literature
us point out that this type of measure of market impact cannot be obtained using
anonymous market data ie one cannot easily identify the meta-order of a given
agent This together with the extremely slow intensity of the price signal with
respect to its statistical uctuations is the reason why empirical results in this
respect have been obtained only in relatively recent years
Figure 8 Averaged empirical market impact curves normalized in time over a
large database of broker meta-orders The t is performed using the impulsive HIM
model This gure has been reproduced from 5
Bacry and Muzy proposed recently a price impact model based on Hawkes pro-
cesses 7 They suggested to directly account for the joint dynamics of mid-price and
the market order occurrences More precisely the four dimensions of their Hawkes
model correspond to the mid-price upward and downward jumps and the buying and
selling market order ow they did not account for the volume of the orders nor the
price jump sizes The matrix kernel  can then be decomposed into four sub-blocks
of size 2  2 The rst one describes the self-excitement of the market order ow
the second one the self-excitement of the price the third one the market impact
of the trades on the price while the last one accounts for the feedback inuence of
price moves on market order ow intensity By calibrating the model directly from
anonymous high-frequency data using the Wiener-Hopf non-parametric estimation
technique described in App C2 on the most liquid maturity of EuroStoxx and Euro-
Bund future contracts over 800 trading days from 2009 to 2012 the authors of 7
were able to disentangle the self and cross excitation dynamics of mid-price changes
from the impact of market orders In particular they have shown that the market
impact block is mainly diagonal buying resp selling orders are mostly triggering
upward resp downward price moves Moreover the shape of the diagonal impact
function is very localized around t  0 This means that a market order no longer
directly impacts the price after a very short delay ie
less that 01s They have
also shown that the feedback sub-block is mostly anti-diagonal with slightly negative
diagonal kernel functions see Sec 224 for a short discussion on negative kernels
That indicates that an upward resp downward jump in the price tends to increase
the intensity of the selling resp buying market order ow and to decrease the
intensity of the buying resp selling market order ow The shape of kernels in-

former estimations performed within lower dimensional models long-range correla-
tion of the signs of the trades and mainly long-range mean-reversion of the price
All these results were conrmed using a database with a much higher precision in
time in the work of 6 see Sec 61 Bacry and Muzy established that within their
framework it is possible to determine the entire impact prole of some meta-order
that is built by accounting for the bare direct localized marked impact and by a
dressed impact that involves mainly the trades power-law self-excitation They
provided analytical expressions for this curve and notably established in both the
increasing and the decreasing phase of the impact function its relationship with
the power-law behavior of the self-exciting kernel of market order events Using the
previously described empirical ndings they have shown that one can recover the
typical shape depicted in Fig 8
In 5 an impact model based on the 2-dimensional Hawkes price model described
in Example 1 of Sec 21 in which only mean-reversion inuence has been kept ie
st  0 has been introduced It takes into account the impact of an exogenous

buying strategy per unit of time so rtdt corresponds to the number of shares
bought between time t and t  dt More precisely the so-obtained Hawkes Impact

in terms of the norm as the herding one no permanent impact and nally C 0 1
corresponds to a contrarian reaction which is not zero but strictly smaller than the
herding reaction Fig 8 shows a t of the empirical market impact curve using this

Let us point out that in a totally dierent framework Jaisson 41 linked in
the asymptotic limit dened by Jaisson and Rosenbaum in 42 see Sec 236 the
power-law exponent of the self-excitement kernel involved in the market order ow
and the power-law exponent of the market impact decay He derived his results

within a 2-dimensional Hawkes model with only self-excitement kernels for the
market order ow from i a price martingale hypothesis and ii a linear market
impact hypothesis
52 Optimal execution
A natural application of price impact models is to dene optimal liquidation strate-
gies Hewlett 40 was the rst to address this problem using Hawkes models He
proposed to model the occurrence of buy and sell market orders on FX markets us-
ing a bivariate exponential Hawkes process He found that these events are mostly
self-excited the cross excitation intensity between buy and sell events being negligi-
ble Using Eq 47 Hewlett determined the expected future trade imbalance that
within a linear price impact model allows one to determine the expected future
price returns and the associated risk He then showed that this approach allows one
to devise a liquidation strategy that maximizes a mean-variance utility function
Application of Hawkes model for optimal execution has also been considered
more recently by Alfonsi and Blanc 1 who modelled the price process using a lin-
ear impact of liquidity takers More precisely the price is decomposed a the sum of a
fundamental price which variations are proportional to a fraction of the trade im-
balance and a transient price that is moved by the remaining fraction of the trade
imbalance but with a damping term that represents the market resiliency caused by
the market makers behavior Alfonsi and Blanc have provided explicit expressions
of optimal liquidation strategy ie the one with the minimum expected cost when
the ow of buysell market orders that impact the price is either a Poisson process
or a 2-dimensional Hawkes process with a symmetric exponential kernel matrix
They notably show that price manipulation strategies ie
liquidation strategies
with negative expected cost always exist for a Poisson model while they can be ex-
cluded in the Hawkes model provided its parameters meet some specic conditions
According the these conditions the self-excitation should exactly compensate the
price resiliency so that resulting price is a martingale The other condition leads
to identify the fraction of endogenous orders within the Hawkes model with the
proportion of market orders involved in the transient part of the price behavior
6 Orderbook models
Modeling faithfully the occurrence of various type of orders in the order book with
the aim of understanding the mechanisms at the origin of price formation volatility
and liquidity variations is probably the main challenge that the applications Hawkes
processes in nancial econometrics have to face Although this goal is far from
being reached some authors have already tackled the problem and made signicant
progress on these issues
61 Level-I book models
The Level-I book description concerns the events that exclusively occur at the best
bid and best ask levels of the order book Even if this approach discards most of the
book information since best bid or best ask values are directly related to the asset
mid-price and market orders mostly impact the book at level-I one can expect that
this level of description is rich enough to capture most of the market features The
study of Biais et al 11 conrms indeed that most of the activity of an order book
takes place close to the best quotes while Cont et al 19 indicate that a substantial
part of the dynamics of prices can be accounted for by the evolution best bid and
best ask only
One of the rst applications of Hawkes models to order-book modeling at level-I
was performed by Large 46 who formalized the concept of book resiliency namely
the ability of the order book to replenish after being depleted by a large trade Large
suggested to quantify resiliency by the way large trades alter future intensities of
order occurrences For that purpose he introduced the response kernel Gijt
Gijtdt  Ecid104 dN i
tcid12cid12F0 dN j
0  1cid105  Ecid2 dN i
tcid12cid12F0cid3 
Gijt simply describes the increase of the future conditional intensity of events of
type i caused directly or indirectly by the the occurrence at time t  0 of an event
of type j In the case of a Hawkes process of kernel matrix  Large proved that Gij
satises the integral equation in Eq 17 dening t In other words the matrix
t can be interpreted as the increase of the expected number of events after a lag
t caused by the occurrence of some event at time 0 Large then considered order
book data from LSE modeled as a 10-dimensional Hawkes processes where the book
events are classied according to whether they move or not the mid-price market
and limit orders that move the mid-prices 4 components if one distinguishes bid
and ask market and limit orders that leave the book unchanged 4 components
and cancel orders 2 components The impact of aggressive orders on the rate of
forthcoming events is then studied The processed data consisted in LSE stock data
Barclays equity timestamped at the resolution of 1s during the 22 trading days of
January 2002 Large used MLE estimation within the class of exponential kernels
in order to estimate  His results allowed him to provide a causal interpretation
Large prefers the term precipitation than cause of the main event occurrence
in the book He mainly found that aggressive limit orders are principally caused
by aggressive market orders measuring thereby the market resiliency in all his as-
pects magnitude trade direction and characteristic time Consistently with former
studies Large estimated that the studied stock value is resilient less than 40  of
cases and when it is the case the book replenishment occurs within a time frame
of around 20s He also shown that market order dynamics is mostly self-excited
and correlated over a large time Aggressive market orders are also triggered by
aggressive limit orders as a consequence of the race to liquidity
A similar analysis of level-I order book data was recently conducted by Bacry
et al 6 These authors made a slightly dierent categorization than Large and
distinguished all book events market limit and cancel orders that leave the mid-
price unchanged 6 components accounting for bid and ask sides from events that
move the mid-price up or down 2 components The dynamics of these event
occurrence has then been modeled as a 8-dimensional Hawkes process Unlike Large
Bacry et al performed a non-parametric estimation of the matrix of kernels using
the method described in Sec C2 They considered book data time-stamped at
a time resolution of 106s and the analysis has been performed up to lags of a
few minutes The event dynamics has thus been considered over a range of time
scales close to eight decades The main result reported by the authors is that the
book event dynamics is mainly self-exciting except for the mid-price changes for
which cross-excitation eects are strongly dominating This is illustrated in Fig 9
where the values of the estimated kernel norms are reported using a color map
one can see that the resulting matrix is mainly diagonal except in the price sub-
block that is anti-diagonal The observation that price changes events are mainly
Figure 9 Empirical determination of the matrix of Hawkes kernel norms in the
8-dimensional model of level-I book events P stands for mid-price change events T
for trade events L for limit order events and C for cancel events The superscripts
a b indicates the direction ask or bid of the events This gure is reproduced
from 6
triggered by price change events is in agreement of Large previously reported results
Moreover Bacry et al observations conrmed the previously reported empirical
fact that this triggering eect is mostly anti-diagonal ie present price changes
impact future price changes in the opposite direction Previous ndings using low-
dimensional model concerning the kernel shapes were also conrmed the market is
highly endogenous whatever the type of event one considers and all the dominating
kernels the diagonal kernels for orders leaving the price unchanged and the anti-
diagonal kernels for mid-price moves are slowly decreasing well described by a
power-law behavior as in Eq 63 The richness of the Hawkes model of 6 allowed
the authors to account for a richer dynamical behavior than previous works and
to describe and quantify the high-frequency inuences between all types of events
They notably characterized the impact of price changes on the book event ow a
quantity that turns out to be very sensitive to the asset tick size as estimated by
the probability that the mid-price has to move They also provided evidence of
some inhibitory eects which result from negative values of some Hawkes kernels
For example it was observed that for a large tick asset like the Euro-Bund futures
an upward price move not only triggers forthcoming trades at bid but also inhibits
trades on the ask side
Restricting previous Large model to market order ows at best bid and best ask
CbCaLbLaTbTaPbPaPaPbTaTbLaLbCaCbBUNDCbCaLbLaTbTaPbPaPaPbTaTbLaLbCaCbDAX06040200204060810Muni-Toke and Pomponio 56 studied the dynamics of trade-through orders A
market order is a trade-through if part of it is executed at the next best limit Thus
for that purpose they used the 2-dimensional Hawkes process with exponential
kernels described by Eq 53 Though very rare for some assets eg Euro-Bund
future trade-through can be quite frequent on other contracts For instance on
the BNP stock 56 nds an average of 400 trade-throughs per day Parametric
estimation using MLE on exponential kernels have been performed on Euronext
stocks restricting intraday-time to 9h30 to 11h30 am to avoid very strong intraday
seasonality eects Goodness of t tests conrm that as for the full market order
ow the main components of the 2-dimensional Hawkes kernel are the self-exciting
kernel
62 Full order book model
In 55 Muni Toke generalized the zero-intelligence model introduced in 64 to
the Hawkes framework While in the latter model the authors built a full model
for the order book in which all the involved ows ie limit and market orders
at any level are independent pure Poisson processes
It is clearly a very rough
approximation market orders are known to be long-range dependent see Sec 31
due to the splitting of large meta-orders Moreover one expect limit orders to be
also highly auto-correlated as well as correlated with the market-order ow due to
the fact market makers interact with market takers In 55 a 2-agents model is
introduced It comprises the following agents
 A liquidity provider 
 Arrivals of limit orders are modeled by using either a pure homogeneous
Poisson process or a 1-dimensional Hawkes process with an exponential
kernel cancellations are treated as in the zero-intelligence model ie
each order has a life-time which is an iid exponential random variable
using whose parameter is xed a priori
 The price-levels of new limit orders are randomly chosen by rst choosing
the bid or ask side with probability 12 and then by sampling their
values from a Student distribution
 A liquidity taker 
 Modeled using either a pure homogeneous Poisson process or a 1-dimensional
Hawkes process with an exponential kernel
All the volumes of both limit and market orders are iid and exponentially dis-
tributed variables Hawkes processes use exponential kernels which are estimated
parametrically using Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Not surprisingly inter-trade times of market orders are shown to be much better
modeled by a 1-dimensional Hawkes process referred to as MM since the only
Hawkes kernel involved is one which deals with the inuence of Market orders on
themselves than by a pure Homogeneous Poisson process HP In the same way
inter-time of limit orders are shown to be much better modeled by a 1-dimensional
Hawkes process LL than by HP Along the same lines the left panel of Fig 10 shows
that inter-time between a given market order and the rst arrival time of a limit
order after that market order is much better reproduced by a 2-dimensional Hawkes
referred to as MMLLLM model with self-exciting kernels for both market MM
and limit orders LL and a single cross-exciting kernel which corresponds to the
inuence of past market orders on future limit orders LM The gure shows that

exciting kernel the one describing the inuence of past limit orders on future market
orders is negligible Thus the order book dynamics seems to be driven mainly by the
liquidity taker agent rather than the liquidity provider ie in a rst approximation
the market makers strategy consists basically in reacting to liquidity takers whereas
liquidity takers take decisions independently from market makers
Finally the right panel of Fig 10 shows the so-obtained distribution of the bid-ask
spread for empirical data the pure Homogeneous Poisson HP model the MMLL
Hawkes model and the MMLLLM model Again this latter model is the one
which best ts the empirical data
Let us mention a theoretical work by Jedidi and Abergel 43 in which a Hawkes-
based markovian framework for the whole order-book dynamics is studied
7 Other models
71 Systemic risk models
Hawkes models have been also be used at coarser time scales where asset prices
are mainly diusive They can be used in mixed models in order for instance to
account for jumps that occur over the diusion process This is the spirit of the
model developed by At-Sahalia et al 63 that proposed to describe the contagion
of a crisis across all the world markets by superimposing a multivariate self-excited
Hawkes process to a standard multivariate continuous diusion model According to
this model called be the authors Mutually exciting Jump-Diusion the log-price
vector satises
dXt  t  tdWt  ZtdNt
where Wt is a D-dimensional Brownian motion t is a stochastic volatility and Nt is
a D-variate Hawkes process that accounts for the self-excited nature of price jumps
occurrence Zt is a random variable accounting for the direction and the intensity of
the jump A GMM estimation procedure is proposed in 63 based on a closed-form
expressions of some moments associated with the returns variations in the univariate
and bivariate cases with exponential Hawkes kernels This estimation has been
applied to ve international equity indices data associated with respectively US
Europe Asian Pacian and Latin America zones The authors found that the jumps
terms have signicant self-excitation components and as far as the contagion eect
is concerned it seems that the US equities are the ones with the greatest inuence
on other markets
In Ref 29 Errais et al proposed to model credit default events in a portfolio of
securities as correlated point processes More specically they considered that the
dynamics of such events is described by a marked Hawkes process with exponential
kernels A stated by Prop 2 in this case the couple of processes  N  is a Markov
process Thanks to the Dynkin formula the authors provided explicit expressions for
the conditional distribution of both the marked and counting processes This result
was used to price portfolios if credit derivatives such as index and tranch swaps
Their model was then calibrated from index and swap data during September 2008
that witnessed several credit default notably Lehman-Brothers default The authors
have shown that by capturing the dependence of default events their model provided
good ts of market data unlike standard approaches that failed during this period
Errais et al emphasized that marked Hawkes models with exponential kernels belong
to the more general class of ane point processes introduced by Due et al 26
An ane point process involves a stochastic intensity vector which is a Markov
process with drift diusion and jump terms Errais et al 29 have shown that their
approach remains tractable within the class of ane point processes that provides
a richer jump interaction structure
Let us also quote the recent similar work of Dassios and Zhao 23 who addressed
the question of default risk modeling and contagion propagation within the frame-
work of the so-called Dynamic Contagion Process that is an exponential marked
Hawkes model but where the Poisson exogenous events the immigrants are re-
placed by a shot-noise constructed as the rst generation of the same exponential
Hawkes model with a dierent mark probability density The authors have estab-
lished the theoretical distributional properties of this new process that remains a
Markov process and provided analytic expressions for the its probability generating
function As in Errais et al 29 they showed that their approach is particularly
suitable for modeling the dependence structure of arriving events with dynamic
contagion and proposed an application to credit risk
72 Accounting for news
In 61 Rambaldi et al used Hawkes processes for modeling the impact of news
on the EBS foreign exchange market quotation time-series consisting in a list of
quotation timestamps Let us note that since EBS data are throttled aggregated
below a window of 01s a randomization procedure has been used for homogeniza-
tion The model for the quotation arrival times is a 1-dimensional Hawkes model
involving either a double exponential or a power-law expressed as a sum of 15 expo-
nentials so to have a convenient Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure The
impact of the news on the quotation time-series can be seen as particular instances
of localized non stationarities Thus Rambaldi et al introduced an exogenous ker-
nel news an exponential function that accounts for the impact of a particular
instance of a news leading to the model 10
t     cid63 dNt  nt  t0
where t0 is the time of occurrence of a particular news Let us point out that n
where n stands for news is allowed to have a non-causal component ie nt
is non zero for t  0 in order to account for anticipation eects Estimation is
performed using regular Maximum Likelihood Estimation procedure on a 3 hour
period around the considered news Though the results are very noisy the authors
showed that the model captures nicely both the amplitude and the time scale of
the news eect The distribution of the L1 norm n for the dierent news has
broad distribution that goes beyond 1 that clearly reects the diverse eects of
news on the market Moreover using some proxies for quantifying how unexpected
a particular news is Rambaldi et al clearly showed that the norm n is not
only related to the news impact but also to its degree of surprise
10Formally this model can be seen as a 1-dimensional version of the 2-dimensional price impact model
of Eq 65 in which f rt is replaced by the Dirac distribution centered at time t0 t  t0
73 High-dimensional models
Modeling co-jumps
In 12 Bormetti et al modeled the complex dynamics
of the extreme returns in a basket of stocks They started by elaborating a rather
elaborate procedure for identifying extreme returns referred to as jumps in the
paper corresponding to anomalous values from 1-minute returns time-series On
a basket of N  20 Italian stocks they found up to 280 jumps on a single stock
on the overall period of 88 days and up to a total of 505 jumps per day on all
the stocks They clearly established that some jumps arrive at the same time ie
within the same time-window This prevents from modeling the overall process as an
N -dimensional Hawkes process Within such a framework co-jumps cannot occur
without introducing an impulsive component inside the kernel  Bormetti et al
nally suggested the following model
 A 1-dimensional Hawkes process is used for modeling the co-jumps arrival
times The kernel of the Hawkes process is chosen to be a sum of exponential
functions
 Each time t a co-jump occurs each stock i independently one form each other
has a probability pi to jump These probabilities are estimated empirically
from real data
 For each stock i a 1-dimensional Hawkes process is used to model the id-
iosyncratic jumps of that stock ie the jumps that are do not correspond to
co-jumps Again the kernels of the Hawkes process is chosen to be a sum of
exponential functions
In their paper Bormetti et al developed a precise procedure to perform estimation
of this model which is shown to be quite robust Moreover they showed that it is able
to capture simultaneously the time clustering of jumps and the high synchronization
of jumps across assets
Clustering with graph models
In 49 Linderman and Adams developed
a probabilistic model that combines Hawkes processes with random graphs models
that they applied on SP100 data Each component of the Hawkes kernel codes the
changes of more than 01 in the last traded price of a given asset during a whole
week Thus a 100-dimensional point process with 182037 events is obtained The
kernels are chosen as
ijt  AijW ijhij t
where A is a random binary 0 or 1 valued matrix W a random matrix with pos-
itive entries and ht a parametric kernel of parameters  such thatcid82 h  1 a
logistic normal density with two parameters is chosen Intraday seasonality is mod-
eled using an exogenous intensity of the form   m  eyt where  is a constant
matrix and yt is univariate Gaussian process The random graph model is used to
reect the probability of the dierent network structures through the prior distribu-
tions of the matrices A and W  They basically depend on a latent distance which is
chosen in R2 imposing an overall sparsity 20 and a characteristic distance scale
Thus each stock k corresponds to a latent coordinate xk in R2 that is estimated
through a fully-Bayesian parallel inference algorithm A gure is displayed where
each stock is represented as a dot in the latent 2-dimensional space with a color
coding corresponding to its corresponding sector among six sectors Linderman
and Adams showed that some sectors notably energy and nancial tend to cluster
together indicating an increased probability of interaction between stocks in the
same sector Other sectors such as consumer goods are broadly distributed sug-
gesting that these stocks are less inuenced by others in their sector One can think
that this approach will pave the way with the framework of multivariate Hawkes
processes to very promising applications where one will process large amounts of
data associated with a great number of interacting componentsagents in order to
shed new light on the complexity of nancial markets
Finally let us note that Mastromatteo and Marsili 52 tried to overcome the
problem of the estimation of a high-dimensional Hawkes process by mapping it onto
a graphical Ising model so to describe the clustering of trading times in a set
stocks They reconstructed the interaction network of the D  100 most traded
stocks of the NYSE during the year 2003 by using machine learning techniques and
reported an overall scaling of the weight matrix W  D1 Their study evidences
the presence of a large collective market mode of the matrix A driving the overall
level of market activity close to the critical point
8 Concluding remarks
Hawkes processes are extremely versatile processes that can be considered as the
building blocks for modeling the occurrence of time-correlated discrete events play-
ing the same role that Auto-Regressive models have for describing continuous-valued
signals Within a relatively simple mathematical framework they allow one to char-
acterize precisely the interactions between dierent categories of events and to ac-
count for their causal relations From the statistical point of view they can be
generated with relatively simple simulation algorithms while several ecient esti-
mation methods exist to calibrate them
Hawkes processes have already proven to be very useful in many domains like
eg the modeling of earthquakes neuronal or social network activity Because they
allow one to describe data at the resolution of individual events and to account
for endogenous triggering contagion and cross-excitation phenomena they have
naturally found applications in the eld of high-frequency nance In this paper we
have proposed an overview of many of such applications that concern a wide variety
of problems From the question of the level of endogeneity of nancial markets to
the modeling of order-book events including impact risk contagion modeling the
design of optimal execution strategies we saw that Hawkes models have been used
to address a large spectrum of issues
Far from being exhaustive this review is necessarily a snapshot of a topic that
is promised to a rapid evolution and growth Many of the studies we mentioned can
be considered as pioneering works that bode more important results and a deeper
understanding of the market dynamics at the microstructural level Among the
promising routes that will be explored in forthcoming studies some can be eas-
ily anticipated Since several market stylized facts at medium or large time scales
seem to originate from the market microstructure the micro-to-macro transition is
an important issue In that respect understanding the long-time behavior of the
Hawkes process and the instabilities that can emerge can be of great importance
One may hope not only to recover known models at larger times but also to account
for genuinely new phenomena like microstructural crashes Beyond the Brownian
limit which one expects in usual situations elucidating the emerging properties of
the Hawkes process close to the instability limit seems a promising area of research
due to the richness of the model in the vicinity of the critical point and also be-
cause empirical data seem to indicate that markets operate close to this instability
threshold
The study and the estimation of Hawkes model in the high-dimensional regime is
also a challenging prospect since the complexity of nancial markets results notably
from the interaction between a very large number of components market partici-
pants agents assets information uxes There have been many progresses made
recently in that direction notably under the impetus of the community of big-data
and the studies of viral diusion across social networks One can expect many in-
teresting applications of theses approaches to high-frequency nance to be proposed
in the next future

B Simulation
There are two main frameworks for simulating Hawkes processes an intensity-based
framework and a cluster-based framework depending on whether it makes direct
use of the intensity regression Eq 2 or of the cluster representation of the Hawkes
process see Sec 237 The most popular method being certainly the intensity-
based thinning method initially introduced by Lewis 48 in the general context of
non homogeneous Poisson processes and modied later by Ogata 58
Thinning The thinning algorithm is an incremental procedure in which the suc-
cessive jumping times are generated sequentially It can be easily adapted to the
multi-dimensional context and can be generalized to the marked case In its simplest
version valid for decreasing kernels given a starting time t it basically consists in
sampling a candidate jumping time t  t using an exponentially distributed ran-
dom variable t with parameter tot
t  Then a random variable U is
uniformly drawn in the interval 0 tot

If not rejected the jump is assigned to the component i where i is the largest in-

Time-change Another common intensity-based approach for simulating a non-
homogeneous Poisson process Nt uses the following well known fact if one denes
is an homogeneous
Poisson process of intensity 1 Thus in order to perform simulation one needs to
know how to simulate F 1

This algorithm has been applied for instance in the case of exponential kernels in 24
In fact in this simpler case it is possible to invert analytically the function F

Cluster algorithm The cluster approach consists basically in simulating the

the generations index n rather then in real time t One can see for instance 54
which describes how one can perform simulation of marked Hawkes processes using
the branching structure A short survey and a more comprehensive list of references
can be found in the recent work 24
C Statistical inference
C1 Parametric estimation
Maximum Likelihood Estimation The most commonly used technique for
parametric estimation of Hawkes processes is the Maximum Likelihood Estimator
MLE which has been rst introduced by Ogata in 60 The log-likelihood of a
non-homogeneous multi-dimensional Poisson dened as in Eq 2 reads
log L   
Dcid88i1cid90 T
Mcid88m1
log km
where the couples tm kmM
m1 denote respectively event times and components
Given a Hawkes kernel  depending upon a set of parameters  it is possible to
estimate it from Eq 70 by solving the problem
   argmax

log L  
In the case of a general Hawkes process the computation of the likelihood or its
gradient is of the order of OM 2D where M is the total number of jumps The
fact that it reduces to OM D when the kernels are exponential functions is one of
the major reasons why exponential kernels or sum of exponential kernels are so
commonly used in a parametric framework 27 55 56 12 61 69
EM based Estimation
In 67 the authors use an Expectation Maximiza-
tion EM based technique an iterative procedure comprising the alternation of two
steps of expectation E and maximization M in order to exploit the cluster rep-
resentation of the Hawkes process described in Sec 237 Given a parametrization
of the Hawkes kernel  and a set of parameters   each iteration consists in
 E-step    pmmcid48 Estimating for all ordered pair of jumps tm tmcid48
with tm  tmcid48 the probability pmmcid48 that within the cluster framework
described in Sec 237 tm is an ancestor of tmcid48
probabilities pmmcid48 estimated in the E-step
 M-step pmmcid48    Computing the model parameters   from the
This algorithm converges very quickly when the product of the average intensity 
and the characteristic timescale  of the support of  is small ie  cid28 1 meaning
that few jumps are detected in intervals of size  
Let us point out that General Method of Moments GMM can be also used 21
based for instance on auto-covariance analytical formula such as 29
High-dimensional estimation All the previous techniques cannot be applied
in a large dimensional context eg D  100 without substantial modications For
instance even in the case of simple exponential kernels the number of parameters
is of the order of D2 so that applications to contexts in which D is large become
unfeasible due to overtting andor computational issues In order to address the is-
sue of parametric estimation in large dimensions one needs to use algorithms which
involve regularization Within the last year Hawkes processes in large dimension
have been the subject of numerous academical papers see for instance 70 Most
of them adapt more or less classical convex optimization techniques in the frame-
work of Hawkes processes with exponential kernels of the form ijijeij t Let us
point out that in all these papers in order to get a convex log-likelihood 70 the
parameters ij are a priori xed ie they are not estimated and generally not
chosen to depend on i or j Thus in that case the kernel matrix  can be written
in matrix form as   et where  is the so-called weighted adjacency matrix
  ij1ijD  describes the connections between the dierent components
In order to solve the so-obtained convex-optimization of
of the Hawkes process
the log-likelihood penalizations terms on  are customarily introduced They are
generally of two sorts an L1 penalization that ensures sparsity and a trace-norm
penalization that ensures low-rank To the best of our knowledge these types of al-
gorithms have only been used once in the context of nance see Sec 73 about 49
Clearly one can easily forecast that there will be in the near future a huge num-
ber of new algorithms for parametric estimation in large dimensions some of them
improving the state of the art
C2 Non-parametric estimation
Very few non-parametric estimators of the kernel matrix of a Hawkes process have
appeared in the academic literature so far We review them in the next section
EM based estimation Historically the rst one 47 corresponds to a non-
parametric version of the EM estimation algorithm described in the previous section
It is based on regularization via L2 penalization of the method initially introduced
by 50 in the framework of ETAS model for seismology It has been developed for
1-dimensional Hawkes processes The maximum likelihood estimator is computed
using the same two steps as in the parametric case The E-step corresponds to
estimating all the pmmcid48 probabilities and the M-step corresponds to estimating t
and  from these probabilities In 47 some numerical experiments on particular
cases are performed successfully even when the exogenous intensity  depends slowly
on time the whole function t is estimated along with the kernel t with a
very good approximation However as explained in 8 this method has two main
drawbacks
decay speed of the kernel t is low eg power-law decaying kernel
 The convergence speed of the EM algorithm drastically decreases when the
 The probabilistic interpretation of the kernel values involved in the EM method
prevents the kernels to have negative values see Sec 224
Contrast function based estimation
In a recent series of papers 62 33
some authors proposed within a rigorous statistical framework a second approach
It relies on the minimization of the so-called L2
for non-parametric estimation
contrast function Given a realization of a Hawkes process Nt on an interval 0 T 
associated with the parameters  t the estimation is based on minimizing the
contrast function C

Let us point out that minimizing the expectancy of the contrast function is equiv-
alent to minimizing the L2 error on the intensity process

The minimum value zero is of course uniquely reached for    and   
In 33 the authors chose to decompose  on a nite dimensional-space in
practice the space of the constant piece-wise functions and to solve directly the
minimization problem 72 in that space For that purpose in order to regularize
the solution they are essentially working with some applications in mind for which
only a small amount of data is available and for which the kernels are known to be
well localized they chose to penalize the minimization with a Lasso term which is
well known to induce sparsity in the kernels ie the L1 norm of the components
of  Let us point out that minimizing the contrast function and minimizing the
expectancy of the contrast function are two dierent stories The contrast function
is stochastic and nothing guarantees that the associated linear equation is not ill-
conditioned
In 33 the authors prove that under certain conditions on  the
linear equation is invertible ie the associated random Gram matrix is almost
surely positive denite
In practice they study real signals from neurobiology
they choose the components of  to be piece-wise constant
The Wiener-Hopf approach Let us point out that since i
t is expressed lin-
ij1 minimizing the L2 error 75 is equivalent
early in terms of i and of the ijtD
to solving a linear equation which is nothing but the Wiener Hopf Eq 38 Conse-
quently minimizing the expectancy of the contrast function is equivalent to solving
the Wiener-Hopf equation In 7 8 the authors chose to perform non-parametric
estimation by directly inverting this system They have proved that as long as
gt corresponds to a conditional intensity of a Hawkes process 38 has a unique
solution in t which is the kernel matrix t The algorithm uses quadrature
technique in order to discretize the system It can be summarized in the following
density estimation techniques
jumps of the realization of N i divided by the overall time realization
 Estimation of the vector  simply using as an estimator of i the number of
 Non-parametric estimation of the matrix gt dened by 36 using kernel
 Fix the number of quadrature points eg gaussian quadrature to be used as
 Discretize the Wiener-Hopf system on the quadrature points and inverse it
This leads to an estimation of the kernel functions on the quadrature points
Estimation on a ner grid as well as L1 norm can be obtained through simple
quadrature formula
well as the support for all the kernel functions
 Estimation of the exogenous intensity  using 21
We refer the reader to 8 where the full algorithm including the methodology for
choosing the bandwidth value for density kernel estimation as well as the number of
quadrature points is described precisely along with the comparisons with the other
methods presented above It has actually been improved in 6 to take particular
care of slowly decreasing kernels
As compared to the approach developed in 33 this algorithm is better adapted
to the case in which a large amount of data is available As compared to the EM
approach we shall advocate its use over the EM algorithm mainly in two cases
which are often satised when dealing with nancial data
 Either the kernel functions are not localized eg power-law Indeed in that
case the EM algorithm is known to be very slow to converge see 47 and 8
 Or some of the kernel functions have negative values see second point on
the EM algorithm above We refer the reader to 33 for justication why
Wiener-Hopf approach allows to deal with negative kernels
Finally let us point out that in the particular case the kernel matrix is known to
be symmetric which is always true if the dimension D  1 the method developed
in 2 uses a spectral method for inverting 23 and deduces an estimation from the
second-order statistics It can be seen as a particularly elegant way of solving the
Wiener-Hopf equation
