ABSTRACT
There is ongoing debate regarding the extent that environment affects galaxy size growth beyond z  1
To investigate the differences in star-forming and quiescent galaxy properties as a function of environment at
z  21 we create a mass-complete sample of 59 cluster galaxies Spitler et al 2012 and 478 eld galaxies
with logMMcid12 9 using photometric redshifts from the ZFOURGE survey We compare the mass-size
relation of eld and cluster galaxies using measured galaxy semi-major axis half-light radii r12ma j from
CANDELS HSTF160W imaging We nd consistent mass normalized logMMcid12 107 sizes for quiescent
eld galaxies r12ma j  181 029 kpc and quiescent cluster galaxies r12ma j  217 063 kpc The mass
normalized size of star-forming cluster galaxies r12ma j  400 026 kpc is 12 larger KS test 21 than
star-forming eld galaxies r12ma j  357010 kpc From the mass-color relation we nd that quiescent eld
galaxies with 97 logMMcid12 104 are slightly redder KS test 36 than quiescent cluster galaxies while
cluster and eld quiescent galaxies with logMMcid12 104 have consistent colors We nd that star-forming
cluster galaxies are on average 20 redder than star-forming eld galaxies at all masses Furthermore we
stack galaxy images to measure average radial color proles as a function of mass Negative color gradients are
only present for massive star-forming eld and cluster galaxies with logMMcid12 104 the remaining galaxy
masses and types have at proles Our results suggest given the observed differences in size and color of
star-forming eld and cluster galaxies that the environment has begun to inuenceaccelerate their evolution
However the lack of differences between eld and cluster quiescent galaxies indicates that the environment
has not begun to signicantly inuence their evolution at z  2

1 INTRODUCTION
Both star-forming and quiescent galaxies exhibit size
growth as a function of redshift eg Daddi et al 2005
Williams et al 2010 van Dokkum et al 2010 Patel et al
2013 with quiescent galaxies growing more rapidly than
star-forming galaxies eg Trujillo et al 2007 McLure et
al 2013 van der Wel et al 2014 The size growth of star-
forming galaxies is thought to be fuelled by the addition of
new gas that produces stars eg Bouch et al 2013 or by mi-
nor mergers eg van Dokkum et al 2010 Quiescent galax-
ies likely grow in size via adiabatic expansion eg Fan et al
2008 2010 or via minor and major mergers eg Khochfar
 Silk 2006 Naab et al 2009 Guo et al 2011 Szomoru et al
2013 However it has been suggested that environment may
affect or accelerate these growth mechanisms eg Hatch et
al 2011 Cooper et al 2012 Maltby et al 2012 Raichoor et
al 2012 Papovich et al 2012 Lani et al 2013 Newman et
al 2013

At z  1 the density-morphology relation demonstrates that
environment can directly affect the properties of galaxies
eg Dressler et al 1997 Postman et al 2005 van der Wel
et al 2007 This empirical relation shows that gas rich star-
forming galaxies are found preferentially in low density envi-
ronments while gas poor quiescent galaxies are found in the
highest density environments The models of Guo  White
2008 show that mergers and star formation contribute almost
equally to the growth rate for galaxies in groups Simulations
have shown that the growth of quiescent galaxies could be ac-
celerated in higher density environments where interactions
are more frequent and that the most massive galaxies typically
reside in the highest galaxy over-densities Maulbetsch et al
2007 Shankar et al 2013 The direct comparison of the sizes
and light proles of eld and cluster galaxies at z  1 could
provide key insight into the epoch and mechanisms where en-
vironment begins to affect the size evolution of star-forming
and quiescent galaxies
A handful of studies have shown that the sizes of massive
quiescent cluster galaxies are up to 50 larger than quies-
cent eld galaxies at z  1 Papovich et al 2012 Bassett et
al 2013 Newman et al 2013 Delaye et al 2014 Delaye et
al 2014 studied the mass-size relation for passive early-type
galaxies in clusters at 11  z  16 with logMMcid12 105
From their best-ts of the mass-size relation they found that
median sizes for quiescent cluster galaxies are 30 larger
than quiescent eld galaxies at the same redshift and mass
Papovich et al 2012 and Bassett et al 2013 examined
quiescent galaxies in a z  16 cluster and found that clus-
ter galaxies have sizes that are 40 larger than coeval eld
ALLEN ET AL
galaxies They attribute some of this difference to recently
quenched galaxies on the cluster outskirts with larger effec-
tive radii Similarly Lani et al 2013 found that quiescent
cluster galaxies at 1  z  2 with logMMcid12 113 have
effective radii up to 50 larger than eld galaxies with similar
mass Newman et al 2013 compared the sizes of eld and
cluster early-type galaxies at z  18 and found that the most
massive cluster galaxies with logMMcid12 115 were larger
than their eld counter-parts However Raichoor et al 2012
measured the mass-size relation for eld and cluster quies-
cent galaxies in a z  13 cluster and tentatively found that the
cluster galaxies have average sizes that are 30 smaller than
eld galaxies with the same mass and redshift Clearly there
is a need for more studies to constrain galaxy size evolution
in over-dense regions at z  1
The study of the size growth of quiescent galaxies as a func-
tion of redshift is relevant because they represent a signicant
fraction of z  0 cluster galaxies however the majority of high
redshift cluster galaxies are star-forming In two spectroscop-
ically conrmed z  2 galaxy clusters the ratio of star-forming
to quiescent galaxies is at least 31Gobat et al 2013 Yuan et
al 2014 Therefore analyzing the sizes and light proles of
star-forming cluster galaxies may also be important in distin-
guishing the effects of environment on galaxy growth
The majority of environmental and size evolution studies at
z  1 quantify the structural properties of individual galax-
ies using HST Papovich et al 2012 Raichoor et al 2012
Szomoru et al 2012 Whitaker et al 2012 Patel et al 2013
Bassett et al 2013 Due to the low surface brightness and
small angular sizes of galaxies at high redshifts measuring
structural parameters for these galaxies is difcult however
the use of HST imaging provides high resolution and the ca-
pability to discern the structural properties of these galaxies
Image stacking that represents an average galaxy can also
be used for low mass galaxies to create a deeper image Av-
erage galaxy radial light proles measured from image stacks
can extend to larger radii van Dokkum et al 2010 used im-
age stacking to study the light proles of a sample of galaxies
with 0  z  2 to a surface brightness depth of  285 AB
mag arcsec1 After integrating these light proles to obtain
the radial surface density they were able to trace the mass
growth of galaxies with 11  logMMcid12  117 and found
that mass was being gradually added at r  5 kpc Mass ex-
cess at large radii supports the idea that at least very massive
galaxies are growing via minor mergers from z  2 Hopkins
et al 2010 Hilz et al 2013 Shankar et al 2013 By compar-
ing the sizes and light proles of eld and cluster star-forming
and quiescent galaxies at high redshift a more comprehensive
picture of size growth and the underlying mechanisms may be
gained
A large sample of both eld and cluster star-forming and
quiescent galaxies is necessary to constrain the epoch at
which environment began to affect galaxy growth however
acquiring large samples of eld and cluster galaxies at high
redshift is difcult First clusters become increasingly rare
at z  1 Secondly current broad-band photometric samples
encounter larger redshift errors and are unable to successfully
identify galaxy over-densities However the FourStar Galaxy
Evolution ZFOURGE survey has produced accurate pho-
tometric redshifts which allow for environment to be deter-
mined as well as other galaxy properties derived from pho-
tometric ts Straatman et al 2015 in prep as was shown
from the discovery of a z  21 galaxy cluster Spitler et al
2012 Yuan et al 2014
In this paper we study for the rst time the mass-size re-
lation for star-forming and quiescent eld and cluster galax-
ies at z  21 obtained from the ZFOURGE survey with
logMMcid12 9 We cross-matched the ZFOURGE catalog
with the size and Srsic index measurements of van der Wel et
al 2014 based on the 3DHST survey Skelton et al 2014
The mass-color relation for star-forming and quiescent eld
and cluster galaxies is also examined In addition we mea-
sure stacked radial color proles of our sample of galaxies
using the HSTWFC3 F160W and HSTACS F814W images
We compare the individual colors radial color proles sizes
and Srsic indices of average eld and cluster galaxies to de-
termine the effects of environment on star-forming and quies-
cent galaxies The paper is organized as follows in Section
2 we describe our sample selection and its properties in Sec-
tion 3 we describe our construction of the mass-size relation
mass-color relation and radial color proles results are dis-
cussed in Section 4 and we present our concluding remarks
in Section 5
Throughout our study we assume a CDM cosmology with
  073 m  027 and H0  71 km s1
2 THE SAMPLE
21 ZFOURGE Imaging and Catalog
The ground-based near-infrared imaging data was taken as
part of the FourStar Galaxy Evolution survey ZFOURGE
Straatman et al 2015 in prep during 2011-2012 using the
Fourstar instrument Persson et al 2013 on the 65 m Mag-
ellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile As
part of this survey 11cid48
 11cid48 areas in the COSMOS Scoville
2007 UDS Lawrence et al 2007 and CDFS Giacconi et
al 2002 elds were targeted using medium-bands J1 J2 J3
Hs Hl and the Ks broad-band The combined length of ob-
servations was  70 hours which translates to 5 depths of 
255 AB mag in J1 J2 J3 and  25 AB mag in Hs Hl and
Ks Tilvi et al 2013 Papovich et al 2014 found that the
ZFOURGE data are 80 complete at KsAB  245 247
and 251 for the CDF-S COSMOS and UDS elds
The raw imaging data was processed with a modied
pipeline based on that of the NEWFIRM survey Whitaker et
al 2011 The reduction process for the data will be fully de-
tailed in Straatman et al in prep The point-spread-function
PSF FWHM of the ZFOURGE Ks-band image is 04cid48cid48
Along with the medium-bands and the Ks-band multi-
wavelength data covering COSMOS was used when preform-
ing SED ts In total there were 34 photometric bands span-
ning rest-frame wavelengths of  01  27m Photometric
redshifts and rest-frame colors were measured by tting tem-
plate SEDs to PSF-matched optical-NIR photometry with the
SED-tting code EAZY Brammer et al 2008 Stellar masses
were obtained by using FAST Kriek et al 2009 to t stellar
population synthesis templates to the same photometry Stel-
lar population models were made with the population synthe-
sis code of Bruzual  Charlot 2003 assuming a Chabrier
IMF and solar metallicity Star formation histories were mod-
elled as exponentially decreasing   et  with values of
logyear7-11 in steps of 02 and logageyr 75  101
insteps of 01 The derived photometric redshift uncertainties
of the ZFOURGE are z1  z  002 Kawinwanichakij et
al 2014 Tomczak et al 2014 Yuan et al 2014 The com-
bined redshift and mass uncertainty ranges from 5 15 over
the redshift range of 05-3 Tomczak et al 2014
FIG 1 Seventh-nearest-neighbor projected density maps of CDFS UDS and COSMOS elds The color bar represents the signicance in sigma of the
projected density of CDFS UDS or COSMOS at 20  z  22 above the mean density The mean density is averaged over all three elds at 18  z  20 and
22  z  24 Field star-forming galaxies open blue triangles and eld quiescent galaxies open red squares were selected from the CDFS and UDS elds
where no signicant  10 large-scale over-densities were found Right Four galaxy over-densities in the COSMOS eld were found using the seventh-
nearest-neighbor metric with photometric redshifts between 20  z  22 Regions A B and C are the original over-densities identied in Spitler et al 2012
Region D was identied post-publication Our sample of cluster galaxies is shown as blue diamonds star-forming galaxies and red circles quiescent galaxies

22 Galaxy Structural Parameters
van der Wel et al 2014 used F125W F140W and F160W
HST imaging from CANDELS Koekemoer et al 2011 Gro-
gin et al 2011 as well as the 3D-HST catalog Skelton et
al 2014 to create catalogs of individual galaxy structural pa-
rameters They used GALAPAGOS which incorporates both
SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 and GALFIT Peng
et al 2010 to detect and model galaxies The galaxies were
t using a single Srsic t with custom made PSFs for each
eld and a limited range of best-t values for structural pa-
rameters such as half-light radius 03  400 pixels Srsic
index 02  8 and axis ratio 00001  1 Measurement un-
certainties were derived by rerunning GALAPAGOS on the
same object over varying image depths the full details of the
parameter tting can be found in van der Wel et al 2012
Reliable ts are agged with f0 or 1 and unreliable ts are
agged f 2 Unreliable ts are agged typically due to low
SNR and blending of objects and we exclude these galax-
ies from size analysis They determined that reliable accu-
racy  20 half-light radii re and Srsic indices n can
be derived for galaxies with F160W magnitudes of 245 and
235 AB magnitudes or brighter respectively We discuss the
F160W magnitude distribution of our sample near the end of
this section
These catalogs include sizes for galaxies within COSMOS
UDS and CDFS and are the largest and most accurate cat-
alogs to date for which we can study the size evolution of
galaxies Therefore we cross-matched the ZFOURGE galaxy
sample with the van der Wel F160W catalog for the three
elds to create a value added catalog that includes sizes for
75  of the ZFOURGE catalogs We were not able to match
100 of the ZFOURGE galaxies because the ZFOURGE sur-
vey footprint is slightly different than the CANDELS image
footprints used to create the van der Wel et al 2014 galaxy
catalogs
23 Field  Cluster Galaxy Selection
The z2095 cluster has 57 spectroscopically conrmed
members obtained by Yuan et al 2014 using MOSFIRE on
Keck I The cluster has a velocity dispersion of 552 kms and
is likely a Virgo-like cluster progenitor However given the
spectroscopic bias toward strong emission-line galaxies and
that Yuan et al 2014 conrm that the photometric redshifts
of ZFOURGE are accurate to within 2 we choose to use
photometric redshifts for our sample selection This will pro-
vide a more uniform selection of all galaxy types The spec-
troscopic redshift and photometric redshift cluster contamina-
tion is discussed at the end of this section
We constructed a mass complete sample of cluster galaxies
in the redshift range of the cluster found in the ZFOURGE
survey at 2  z  22 Spitler et al 2012 with logMMcid12 
9 for mK  245 AB mag to examine the effects of envi-
ronment on the evolution of galaxies This cluster consists of

as lled open blue diamonds triangles Quiescent cluster eld galaxies
are shown as lled open red circles squares The black line represents the
boundary for quiescent galaxies above and star-forming galaxies below as
dened by Spitler et al 2012
three over-densities A B and C that were originally iden-
tied using the seventh-nearest neighbour metric see Spitler
et al 2012 for details Post-publication and after catalog
renements an additional over-density D was discovered at
the same redshift range and in the vicinity as the three listed
in Spitler et al 2012 and is included in our study In Fig-
ure 1 we show a revised seventh-nearest-neighbor projected
density map of the signicance in sigma of COSMOS at
20  z  22 above the mean density The mean density is av-
eraged over all three elds at 18  z  20 and 22  z  24
The over-density has a complex structure and in or-
der to maximize the amount of structure included in our
cluster galaxy selection we dene the center of D to be
RA  100017520 DEC  02173120 J2000 Using
these center coordinates as well as the centroids for the origi-
nal over-densities from Spitler et al 2012 cluster members
were dened as galaxies within 48cid48cid48 400 kpc of these co-
ordinates and within the redshift range 2  z  22 In Figure
1 we show our sample of cluster galaxies as lled red circles
quiescent galaxies and lled blue diamonds star-forming
galaxies within 48cid48cid48 apertures black circles We selected
48cid48cid48 apertures for the cluster distances so as to minimize con-
tamination of eld galaxies and maximize the amount of clus-
ter members
We selected our eld galaxy sample from the UDS and
CDFS elds because of the known over-density at 2  z  22
in the COSMOS eld Field galaxies were selected using the
same redshift and mass limits as the cluster galaxy sample
In Figure 1 we show a revised seventh-nearest-neighbor pro-
jected density map of the signicance in sigma of CDFS ad
UDS at 20  z  22 above the mean density The mean
density is averaged over all three elds at 18  z  20
and 22  z  24 We use this to conrm no signicant
 10 large-scale over-densities exist in UDS and CDFS
at 2  z  22
The cluster contamination fraction was estimated by two
FIG 3 Top Distributions of mK for our sample of eld open his-
tograms and cluster closed histograms quiescent left panel and star-
forming right panel galaxies The dashed and light color histograms show
where the eld and cluster samples fall below the K-band magnitude limit of
mK  245 AB mag for logMMcid12 9 shown as a dashed black line We
remove galaxies that fall below this limit Bottom Distributions of mF160W
magnitudes for our sample of eld open histograms and cluster closed his-
tograms quiescent left panel and star-forming right panel galaxies The
dashed and light color histograms show where the eld and cluster samples
fall below the mF160W magnitude limit for reliable sizes shown as a dashed
black line
different methods First we calculated the number density
of eld galaxies in UDS and CDFS in the redshift range of
the cluster in COSMOS and then divided this by the cluster
number density We then determine a cluster contamination
fraction of 025 for star-forming galaxies and 01 for quies-
cent galaxies The second method for estimating the cluster
contamination came from using the high condence spectro-
scopic redshifts of Yuan et al 2014 Out of the total photo-
metric cluster sample 64 16 galaxies have spectroscopic red-
shifts not within the cluster Therefore we can estimate the
contamination is 1664 or 25 which is equivalent to the con-
tamination estimated for the star-forming photometric sam-
The U  V versus V  J rest-frame color-color diagram has
been shown to efciently separate quiescent galaxies from
star-forming galaxies when accurate rest-frame colors are
used eg Williams et al 2009 Wuyts et al 2009 Whitaker
et al 2012 Wild et al 2014 Specically older stellar pop-
ulations with strong Balmer breaks 4000 are characterised
by red U  V colors and blue V  J colors From EAZY SED
ts of the photometric data we were able to calculate rest-
frame colors for the galaxies in our sample We separate our
eld and cluster galaxies into star-forming and quiescent us-
ing the quiescent selection box on the UVJ color relation de-
ned by U  V  087  V  J  060 U  V  13 and
V  J  16 Galaxies that lie above this diagonal are clas-
sied as quiescent The UVJ relation for our sample is shown
in Figure 2 The cluster sample contains 9 quiescent galaxies
and 55 star forming galaxies The eld sample contains 35
quiescent galaxies and 541 star forming galaxies
At z  2 ZFOURGE is mass complete to masses of
logMMcid12 9 for mK  245 AB mag Straatman et al
2015 in prep Papovich et al 2014 nd that the ZFOURGE
data are at least 80 complete at this depth in all three elds
In Figure 3 we show the distribution of mK for eld and cluster
star-forming and quiescent galaxies We nd that 100 of the
star-forming eld galaxies and 5 star-forming cluster galaxies

FIG 4 Mass-size relation for our sample of quiescent left and star-forming right eld and cluster galaxies at z  21 Star-forming eld cluster galaxies
are shown as open lled blue triangles diamonds Quiescent eld cluster galaxies are shown as open lled red squares circles Our ts are calculated
using the parametrized-t slope of van der Wel et al 2014 for star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z  225 The ts are shown as dashed solid lines for eld
cluster galaxies The errors were calculated from bootstrapping the t and the distribution of ts was non-gaussian therefore we use percentiles equivalent to
1 for the errors shown as light dark contours for eld cluster galaxies We show the best-ts for star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z  225 from van der
Wel et al 2014 as grey contours which include the 1 scatter There is a discrepancy between the t to our data and the best-t of van der Wel et al 2014 for
quiescent galaxies due to their exclusion of galaxies with logMMcid12 103 If we exclude quiescent galaxies with logMMcid12 103 from our t our sizes
are consistent with van der Wel et al 2014 see text
Our ts indicate that quiescent cluster and quiescent eld galaxies are consistent in size Star-forming cluster galaxies are larger in size than eld star-forming
galaxies by 24
fall below the ZFOURGE mK selection magnitude limit and
were removed from the sample All of the quiescent galaxies
are above the magnitude limit In the lower panels of Figure 3
we show the distribution of mF160W magnitudes of our sam-
ple If we remove galaxies that are fainter than mK  245 AB
mag from our sample we have 40 star-forming and 2 quies-
cent eld galaxies that lie below the F160w magnitude limit
for reliable sizes see Figure 3 bottom panel These galaxies
will have larger uncertainties in their sizes however we do
not remove them from the sample because we weight by error
in size when calculating our median sizes The nal sample
size for each environment and galaxy type is show in Table 1
3 ANALYSIS  RESULTS
31 Mass-Size Relation
In Figure 4 we show the mass-size distribution of the eld
and cluster galaxies We dene galaxy size as the half-light
effective radii measured along the semi-major axis r12ma j
obtained from the van der Wel et al 2014 size catalog The
effective radii are measured using GALFIT and we only use
objects that were agged to have reliable structural parame-
ters The fraction of galaxies used for the median size calcu-
lation for each sample is shown in Table 1
In order to determine if cluster and eld galaxies differ in
their sizes we use the same parameterization as van der Wel
et al 2014 to t for the mean size as a function of mass
where m  M5 1010 Mcid12 and is the same mass normal-
r mkpc  A  m
ization used by van der Wel et al 2014 We adopt the slope
of the mass-size relation  of van der Wel et al 076 004
and 022 001 for star-forming and quiescent galaxies re-
spectively and simply t for the y-intercept A Errors in the
mean size are determined from bootstrapping the t for A
The mass normalised mean sizes for m  M5 1010 Mcid12
derived from the best ts and their errors are shown in Table 1
In Figure 4 we show the best-ts to the sizes of eld and
cluster galaxies along with bootstrap derived errors The best-
t normalization that we nd for the star-forming galaxies is
consistent with that found by van der Wel et al 2014 for
star-forming galaxies at z  225 For both eld and cluster
quiescent galaxies our best t is offset to larger sizes relative
to the best t derived by van der Wel et al 2014 This offset
is due to the fact that their t includes a morphological mis-
classication fraction and mass limit of logMMcid12 103
which excludes objects that scatter to the upper left region
of the size-mass relation
If we exclude quiescent galaxies
with logMMcid12 103 from our t we nd eld and cluster
mass-normalized sizes of 113 014 kpc and 132052
038 kpc
respectively which are consistent with the sizes of quiescent
galaxies at z225 found by van der Wel et al 2014 Given
we are interested in determining the difference between the
average sizes of eld and cluster galaxies and assuming that
both the eld and cluster quiescent galaxy populations with
logMMcid12 103 are represented we include all galaxies
that have colors consistent with quiescent galaxies and with
logMMcid12 9 in our t The mass-normalised sizes are
listed in Table 1

for the error in the average Srsic index We found that the
average Srsic indices of quiescent eld n  339 034 and
cluster n  349  066 galaxies are consistent The Srsic
indices of star-forming eld galaxies n  164007 are con-
sistent with the Srsic indices of star-forming cluster galax-
ies n  147  019 We note that some of the eld quies-
cent and eld and cluster star-forming galaxies have mF160W
below 235 AB mags which is the magnitude limit for reli-
able  20 Srsic indices However when we remove these
galaxies the distribution and median Srsic do not change
The median Srsic values and their errors are listed in Table
33 Colors
In order to determine if the stellar populations of eld and
cluster galaxies differ we examine their individual integrated
colors We use the CANDELS F814W HSTACS  026
m rest-frame and F160W HSTWFC3  048 m rest-
frame images which contain our galaxy sample The two
HST images have different point spread functions PSFs
therefore we used a F814W HSTACS image PSF matched to
F160W HSTWFC3 from 3D-HST Brammer et al 2012 To
obtain individual galaxy colors we rst create image thumb-
nails of 60 60 pixels or  30 30 kpc at z  21 for each
galaxy from both the HST images
To reduce contamination from neighboring galaxies we cre-
ate a mask for each galaxy thumbnail that ags all objects in
the image except the central galaxy The masking was accom-
plished by using SExtractor with a detection threshold of 12
above the background rms level to create a bad pixel mask
To probe the global colors of our sample and how they vary
with each sample we use an aperture D 06cid48cid48 that contains a
large fraction of the global ux for these galaxies We centre
the aperture on the galaxy and measure the ux in both the
HSTF814W and HSTF160W images Using the zero-point
for each lter we convert the ux to AB magnitudes We show
the observed F814WF160W color roughly equivalent to a
rest-frame UV color versus mass relation in Figure 6
As seen in Figure 6 galaxy colors are mass dependent and
become redder as mass increases for both star-forming and
quiescent galaxies see Peng et al 2010 To disentangle this
effect and see if there is an environmental dependence we
separate our eld and cluster galaxies by mass and then cal-
culate their average colors We dened our mass bins so that
we have roughly equal numbers of quiescent galaxies in each
bin The mass bins and observed colors for star-forming and
FIG 5 Distribution of Srsic indices of eld and cluster star-forming
blue and quiescent red galaxies The left panel shows cluster galaxies
solid histogram and the right panel shows eld galaxies open histogram
The average Srsic index with one sigma error for each sample is shown with
the same symbol and color coding as Figure 4 the eld values are offset by 1
in y-space so that they can be distinguished from the cluster average Srsic
indices have a similar distribution for eld and cluster galaxies
ies are 12 larger than the mean sizes of eld star forming
galaxies Cluster star-forming galaxies with logMMcid12 9
have typical sizes of 400026 kpc and eld galaxies have
typical sizes of 357010 kpc A Kolmogorov-Smirnov KS
test indicates that the star-forming eld and cluster size distri-
butions differ by 21
The mean sizes of quiescent eld and cluster galaxies with
logMMcid12 9 are consistent within the errors with clus-
ter galaxies having typical sizes of 217063 kpc and eld
galaxies of 181029 kpc Our sample of cluster quiescent
galaxies is small however we only have one galaxy with
logMMcid12 105 and r12ma j  1 kpc suggesting a lack
of compact massive cluster quiescent galaxies
In Section 4 we review the effect that a large error in the
median size of the cluster quiescent galaxies has on the sen-
sitivity of detecting a difference in median sizes of quiescent
eld and cluster galaxies
32 Srsic indices
In addition to galaxy size as a function of environment we
examine the distribution of Srsic indices for our eld and
cluster samples shown in Figure 5 One constraint used by van
der Wel et al 2014 during the GALFIT tting process was
that Srsic values where xed to a set range from n  02  8
While the majority of single sersic ts have proven to pro-
vide reasonable ts for galaxy structural parameters at high
redshifts occasionally some galaxies may be better t with a

quiescent eld and cluster galaxies are listed in Table 33
We see an evolution towards redder colors as a function of
mass in the average colors of both quiescent and star-forming
eld and cluster galaxies The mean color is 18 redder for
eld quiescent galaxies with 97  logMMcid12  104 than
the mean color for cluster galaxies of the same mass We nd
no signicant difference in the mean color of eld and cluster
quiescent galaxies with logMMcid12  104
In each mass bin cluster star-forming galaxies have colors
that are 20 redder than their eld counter-parts A KS test
indicates that the star-forming eld and cluster color distribu-
tions differ by 364 The average colors for each environ-
ment are listed in Table 2
34 Radial Color Proles
In addition to individual galaxy colors color gradients are
an effective means of studying a galaxies radial distribution
of stellar populations eg Welikala  Kneib 2012 By com-
paring color gradients of eld and cluster galaxies it is possi-
ble to see if environment plays a role in determining the stellar
populations of galaxies van Dokkum et al 2010
We utilized image stacking to create deep averaged images
of our samples of eld and cluster star-forming and quies-
cent galaxies We use the same mass bins image stamps
and masks created to measure the individual galaxy colors
for the image stacks Table 33 Since we are stacking im-
ages we also run SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 and use
pixel-by-pixel interpolation shifts via IRAFs IMCOPY pack-
age to ensure that all galaxy centers coincide with the cen-
tral pixel of the image thumbnail Additionally galaxy im-
ages are normalized by their K-band ux in our F814W and
F160W stacks so that bright galaxies do not dominate The
galaxy image thumbnails are averaged via IRAFs IMCOM-
BINE with a bad pixel ag that gives masked objects zero
weight We repeat this process for each environment-mass
bin for the F814 HSTACS and F160W HSTWFC3 images
The low-mass eld star-forming image stacks are the deepest
with an increased SN of  243
We then measured the azimuthially averaged radial light
proles for the image stacks in the two HST images Radial
light proles from each image stack were measured by aver-
aging pixels in radial bins using a custom python code The
difference of these radial light proles is the observed color
We show the observed radial color for the cluster and eld
galaxies in Figure 7 with 1 errors derived from bootstrapping

FIG 7 Observed radial color prolest for quiescent top panel and star-forming bottom panel eld and cluster galaxies Quiescent cluster eld galaxies
are shown as lled open red circles squares Star-forming cluster eld galaxies are shown as lled open blue diamonds triangles In each panel our

using stellar population evolution models from EZGAL Models with exponentially declining star-formation are labeled exp while models with a single stellar
population are labeled SSP We nd that stellar evolution models with no dust and solar metallicity are consistent with the low and intermediate mass star-
forming sample For the high mass star-forming sample models with dust extinction of Av  15 are necessary to account for the redder colors Single stellar
population models are consistent with the colors we nd for our high mass quiescent galaxy sample However the colors of the intermediate mass quiescent
sample are consistent with exponentially decreasing star formation and a dust extinction of Av  15

els with a single stellar population SSP and solar metallicity
for the quiescent galaxies For the star-forming galaxies we
used models with exponentially declining star-formation and
  1 Gyr solar metallicity and dust extinction ranging be-
tween Av  0 to 25
The radial color proles of low mass eld and cluster star-
forming galaxies are consistent within their errors at and
extend to  6 kpc The observed colors for these galaxies
are consistent with EZGAL models which have no dust and
z f  4
The intermediate mass star-forming eld galaxies have
deep proles and we can trace their color out to  8 kpc
However there is no color gradient for these galaxies and their
colors are equivalent with the cluster star-forming galaxies at
the same mass The colors of star-forming eld and cluster
intermediate mass galaxies correspond with EZGAL models
which have no dust and z f  4
The high mass eld and cluster star-forming galaxies are
consistent in color which is more red than for the lower mass
galaxies The observed colors of star-forming eld and cluster
high mass galaxies match EZGAL models which have dust
attenuation of Av  15 and z f  4 Both high mass eld and
cluster star-forming galaxies show a negative color gradient
towards bluer colors at r  2 kpc
In the top panel of Figure 7 we show that the interme-
diate mass eld and cluster quiescent galaxies have proles
that are consistent within their errors The intermediate mass
eld quiescent galaxies may have bluer colors at larger radius
however we do not have a deep enough image stack ie too
few galaxies to distinguish this The colors of these galax-
ies are interesting as they are not consistent with models con-
taining simply an old SSP However models with exponen-
tially declining star-formation   1 Gyr dust attenuation of
Av  15 and and z f  4 have colors which match those of our
sample
The high mass quiescent eld and cluster galaxies are con-
sistent in color and have colors analogous with a SSP and
z f  3 As for the intermediate mass eld and cluster qui-
escent galaxies the high mass eld and cluster galaxy stacks
are also shallow and do not extend to large enough radius to
potentially reveal a signicant color gradient
4 DISCUSSION
For the rst time we have studied the relationship between
environment and structuralstellar properties of star-forming
and quiescent galaxies at z  21 We found that at z  21 en-
vironment may be beginning to inuence the sizes and stellar
populations of star-forming galaxies However at this epoch
it does not appear that environment is affecting the sizes or
stellar populations of quiescent galaxies
41 Quiescent Galaxies
Our sample of cluster quiescent galaxies is small and we
suffer from poor statistics which drives the error in obtain-
ing a robust comparison to our quiescent eld sample The
size difference measured between cluster and eld galaxies
r12ma j has an error of 069 kpc which is 32 of the clus-
ter galaxy size and 38 of the eld galaxy size Therefore
 httpwwwbaryonsorgezgalmodel
if the environment effects the sizes of quiescent galaxies at
 07 kpc we would not be sensitive to it However we
do note that there is only one cluster quiescent galaxy with
logMMcid12 105 and r12ma j  1 kpc suggesting a lack of
massive compact cluster quiescent galaxies This is in agree-
ment with Papovich et al 2012 who found a lack of massive
compact cluster quiescent galaxies compared to the eld at
xed mass
Mergers are thought to play a major role in the growth of
massive galaxies eg Naab et al 2009 In higher density
regions where clusters are still virializing interactions be-
tween galaxies are more common and quiescent cluster galax-
ies could be undergoing mergers Slight differences in stel-
lar populations or colors for eld and cluster galaxies are a
method of identifying growth via mergers By analysing the
mass-color relation for individual eld and cluster galaxies
separated by mass we can see if there is a difference in color
between the two environments The mean color of intermedi-
ate mass eld quiescent galaxies is 18 205 redder than
cluster galaxies at the same mass There is only a 6 139
difference in the mean color of high mass eld and cluster
quiescent galaxies The lack of a signicant color difference
for quiescent cluster galaxies indicates that mergers are not
yet occurring or we are not sensitive enough to detect them
Another way to look for color differences is to use radial color
proles to distinguish if mass is being added to the galaxy
The observed radial color proles of our intermediate mass
eld and cluster quiescent galaxies only reach  4 kpc and
are consistent within their errors We nd that the radial
color proles of the high mass quiescent sample are consis-
tent across environment as well It is possible that both the
intermediate and high mass quiescent galaxies are accreting
mass at large radius and thus have bluer colors at large galac-
tic radius however we are not sensitive enough to detect it
At z  2 there is evidence that cluster quiescent galaxies
are larger in size than coeval eld quiescent galaxies so this
growth must occur over a short timescale Papovich et al
2012 Lani et al 2013 or the difference in size at this epoch
is too weak for us to detect
42 Star-forming Galaxies
In Figure 8 we show the evolution of the size mass relation
for star-forming galaxies using the sizes and best t relation
of van der Wel et al 2014 The mean size that we nd for
cluster galaxies is 12 154 larger than the mean size of
eld galaxies at the same mass In addition performing a KS
test indicates that the star-forming eld and cluster size dis-
tributions differ at a signicance of 210 Our mean size for
cluster star-forming galaxies lies on the van der Wel et al t-
ted relation however differs by 10 from their mean size for
star-forming galaxies at z  225 The mean size of our eld
star-forming galaxies is consistent with the mean size van der
Wel et al 2014 found for star-forming galaxies at z  225
however it does not lie on the relation at z  21 van der Wel
et al 2014 do not differentiate between eldgroupcluster
galaxies in their sample selection and if environmental effects
are not corrected for then their average sizes would be larger
than what would be found for a true eld population The
size difference we nd between star-forming eld and clus-
ter galaxies is not consistent with Bassett et al 2013 who
found no signicant differences in the sizes of star-forming
eld and cluster galaxies at z  16 Additionally Lani et al
2013 found no environmental dependence for the mass-size
relation of star-forming galaxies at z  1  2

them into star-forming and quiescent We utilized the mor-
phological catalog of van der Wel et al 2014 to analyse the
size versus mass relation and distribution of Srsic indices for
this sample of galaxies We further analyzed galaxy color gra-
dients as a function of mass and environment Our main re-
sults are the following
 We nd that the mass normalized logMMcid12 107
sizes of cluster star-forming galaxies are 12 larger
15 than eld star-forming galaxies A KS test shows
that the distribution of sizes for eld and cluster star-
forming galaxies differs by 21 However the Srsic
indices of these two populations are consistent within
the errors
 Mean observed F814W-F160W colors for star-forming
cluster galaxies are 20 redder than eld galaxies at all
masses A KS test conrms that the color distributions
of the two populations differ by 364
 Radial observed F814W-F160W color proles for star-
forming eld and cluster galaxies are consistent for
each mass bin A color negative gradient is observed
in both eld and cluster star-forming galaxies with
logMMcid12 104 therefore we cannot distinguish
the source of the larger sizes of cluster star-forming
galaxies No color gradients are observed for eld or
cluster star-forming galaxies with logMMcid12 104
 Quiescent eld and cluster galaxies are consistent in
size and in Srsic index However we are only sensitive
to differences of 07 kpc or greater due to our sample
 Mean colors
for quiescent eld galaxies with
97  logMMcid12  104 are 18 redder 2 than
cluster galaxies with the same mass The mean colors
are the same across environment for higher masses
 Radial observed F814W-F160W color proles for qui-
escent eld and cluster galaxies are consistent for each
mass bin and at
The combination of accurate photometric redshifts catalogs
of structural parameters and image stacking has allowed us to
probe a high redshift sample of eld and cluster galaxies Our
results imply that the effect of environment on galaxy sizes
at z  21 is only signicant for star-forming galaxies Even
though there is evidence that our cluster is still in the early
stages of formation Spitler et al 2012 we are able to detect
a difference in the sizes and stellar populations of star-forming
cluster galaxies compared to coeval eld galaxies The neg-
ative color gradient of massive star-forming cluster galaxies
suggests growth via minor mergers although eld galaxies
at the same mass also display similar negative color gradi-
ents We require deeper imaging to determine if the negative
color gradient for star-forming cluster galaxies extends as far
as the eld population At z  2 there is evidence that quies-
cent cluster galaxies are larger in size than coeval eld galax-
ies so this growth must occur over a short timescale Lani et
al 2013 Papovich et al 2012 The early stage of forma-
tion of our cluster could explain why we do not see larger
sizes for cluster quiescent galaxies The mechanisms which
affect star formation and general mass growth of galaxies in
dense environments are poorly understood at high redshift To
FIG 8 Evolution of the mass-size relation at xed stellar mass of
logMMcid12  107 The large blue open and closed points are the best-
t sizes of eld and cluster star-forming galaxies from this work The small
cyan points are the best-t sizes of star-forming galaxies from van der Wel et
al 2014 for different redshifts Their tted relation for these sizes is shown
as a cyan dashed line
The fact that we nd a signicant difference in the mean
sizes of eld and cluster star-forming galaxies suggests that
the cluster environment may be accelerating the evolution of
massive star-forming galaxies van Dokkum et al 2010
found that galaxies with logMMcid12  111 grow preferen-
tially via minor mergers from 0  z  2 At z  2 we do
not have a signicant number of galaxies above this mass
limit however the star-forming galaxies in our sample with
logMMcid12  104 could also be growing via minor merg-
ers Here we analyze the stellar populations of our eld and
cluster star-forming galaxies samples by using their observed
colors to look for signatures of minor mergers
We nd that the mean colors of star-forming cluster galax-
ies are 20 redder than eld galaxies at all masses After per-
forming a KS test on the two color distributions we nd that
they differ by 364 This is suggestive that environment is
beginning to inuence the stellar populations of these galax-
The radial color proles of star-forming galaxies can be
used to distinguish if minor mergers are inuencing their
growth We nd that low and intermediate mass eld and
cluster star-forming galaxies have color proles that are con-
sistent and at We nd that high mass eld and cluster star-
forming galaxies have bluer colors at radii above 2 kpc This
is consistent with Szomoru et al 2011 who nd negative
color gradients for both star-forming and quiescent galaxies at
z  2 with 101 logMMcid12 111 This is suggestive that
both eld and cluster star-forming galaxies are experiencing
growth via minor mergers however we do not have the sen-
sitivity to determine whether the color proles at large radii
of star-forming cluster galaxies become steeper than the pro-
les of star-forming eld galaxies This would be important to
quantify and to determine if minor mergers are more predom-
inate in the cluster environment or if other mechanisms are
causing the larger sizes for the star-forming cluster galaxies
5 CONCLUSIONS
Our aim was to determine the effects of environment on
galaxy evolution using a galaxy cluster at z  21 We created
a sample of eld and cluster galaxies with logMMcid12  9
and used the UVJ rest-frame color-color diagram to separate
distinguish between which growth mechanisms are dominate
and how they evolve with time more studies which use larger
samples of cluster and eld galaxies at 1  z  2 are neces-
