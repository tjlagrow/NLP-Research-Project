ABSTRACT
We investigate the redshift z evolution of dust mass and abundance their dependences on initial
conditions of galaxy formation and physical correlations between dust gas and stellar contents at
dierent z based on our original chemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation with dust growth
and destruction In this preliminary investigation we rst determine the reasonable ranges of the most
important two parameters for dust evolution ie the timescales of dust growth and destruction by
comparing the observed and simulated dust mass and abundances and molecular hydrogen H2 content
of the Galaxy We then investigate the z-evolution of dust-to-gas-ratios D and H2 gas fraction fH2 
and gas-phase chemical abundances eg AO  12  logOH in the simulated disk and dwarf galaxies
The principal results are as follows Both D and fH2 can rapidly increase during the early dissipative
formation of galactic disks z  2  3 and the z-evolution of these depends on initial mass densities
spin parameters and masses of galaxies The observed AO  D relation can be qualitatively reproduced
but the simulated dispersion of D at a given AO is smaller The simulated galaxies with larger total dust
masses show larger H2 and stellar masses and higher fH2 Disk galaxies show negative radial gradients
of D and the gradients are steeper for more massive galaxies The observed evolution of dust masses
and dust-to-stellar-mass-ratios between z  0 and 04 can not be reproduced so well by the simulated
disks Very extended dusty gaseous halos can be formed during hierarchical build-up of disk galaxies
Dust-to-metal ratios ie dust-depletion levels are dierent within a single galaxy and between dierent
galaxies at dierent z

introduction
Interstellar dust plays a number of key roles in galaxy
formation and evolution For example molecular hydro-
gen H2 can form on the surface of dust grains eg Gould
 Salpeter 1963 Hollenbach  Salpeter 1971 so that the
time evolution of H2 content and the star formation pro-
cesses in giant molecular clouds can be inuenced by dust
abundances in galaxies Dust grains are fundamentally
important for the fragmentation processes of metal-poor
gas clouds and thus for the formation of low-mass stars in
the early universe eg Larson 2005 Schneider  Omukai
2010 Spectral energy distributions SEDs of galaxies
are strongly inuenced by dust abundances compositions
and size-distributions within galaxies eg Popescu et al
2000 Takeuchi et al 2005 Therefore the time evo-
lution of photometric and spectroscopic properties star
formation rates and cold gas contents in galaxies can be
strongly coupled with the cosmic evolution of interstellar
dust Theoretical studies have not yet investigated how
interstellar dust can possibly inuence galaxy formation
and evolution processes in detail
A growing number of observational studies by space
infrared telescopes eg Spitzer Herschel and AKARI
have revealed dust properties for a large number of galaxies
with dierent masses and types in dierent environments
and their correlations with galaxy properties such as total
stellar masses eg Draine et al 2007 Dunne et al 2011
D11 Kaneda et al 2011 Cortese et al 2012 Smith et al
2012 Davies et al 2014 Furthermore these observations
have also revealed the spatially resolved dust properties in
nearby galaxies and accordingly provided new constraints
on dust evolution models in galaxies eg Meixner et al
2010 Pappalardo et al 2012 P12
In spite of these
signicant progresses in observational studies theoretical
studies have not yet explained many of these latest new
observational results
Physical properties of dust have been recently observed
to be dierent between galaxies at dierent z For exam-
ple one of the most distant quasars SDSS J11485251
at z  64 has been observed to have a large amount of
H2 gas and dust eg Bertoldi et al 2003 Beelen et al
2006 Recent ALMA observations of a very high redshift
star-forming galaxy at z  66 Himiko on the other
hand revealed that this galaxy has a very low dust con-
tent consistent with primordial interstellar gas Ouchi et
al 2013 Kashino et al
2013 have investigated the
level of dust extinction in distant galaxies at 14  z  17
by using the results of a near-IR spectroscopic survey of
the COSMOS eld and found that the extinction level is
elevated at high mass galaxies compared to low-z coun-
terparts These observed dierences of dust properties in
galaxies at dierent z and the z-evolution of galactic dust
properties are yet to be explained by theoretical models of
galaxy formation
The time evolution of dust and physical correlations be-
tween dust properties and other galaxy properties eg
gas-phase abundances have long been investigated mainly
by one-zone or multi-zone chemical evolution models eg
Dwek  Scalo 1979 1980 Dwek 1998 D98 Lisenfeld 
Ferrara 1998 Hirashita 1999 Edmunds 2001 Inoue 2003
Calura et al 2008 Asano et al 2013 Zhukovska  Hen-
ning 2013 Owing to the lack of spatial resolution in these
models 2D distributions of dust properties in galaxies
were not investigated in the models though they already
discussed a few dust scaling relation eg AO  D corre-
lation The z-evolution of dust properties in galaxies was
not investigated in these previous one-zone models that
are not based on a cosmological model Chemodynamical
simulations with dust evolution could be ideal theoretical
tools for discussing the spatially resolved dust properties
of galaxies and redshift evolution of dust revealed in recent
observations described above
Bekki 2013a B13a rst incorporated both dust growth
and destruction and H2 formation on dust grains in the
chemodynamical simulations with star formation from H2
gas and thereby investigated the time evolution of dust
and H2 properties of galaxies in a self-consistent manner
However the initial conditions of galaxy formation in B13a
are highly idealized for its preliminary investigation of dust
evolution and are not those adopted in numerical simula-
tions of galaxy formation based on a CDM cosmology
Therefore neither the z-evolution of dust properties nor
the roles of hierarchical growth of galaxies in dust evolu-
tion were investigated in B13a Given a growing number
of observational studies on dust properties of galaxies at
dierent z it is timely for theoretical studies of galaxy for-
mation to investigate the evolution of dust in the context
of hierarchical galaxy formation
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the z-
evolution of dust and H2 properties of galaxies and cor-
relations between dust and galaxy properties eg total
stellar masses at z  0 by using numerical simulations
of galaxy formation based on CDM cosmology We par-
ticularly investigate i whether the observed AO  D re-
lation can be reproduced by the present simulations ii
how the z-evolution of D and fH2 dust-to-metal-ratio
depends on initial masses and spin parameters of galax-
ies and iii how D and fH2 are spatially dierent within
a galaxy iv whether the observed dust scaling relation
can be reproduced and v how dust evolution is dierent
between luminous disk galaxies and dwarfs The present
study also predicts physical correlations between dust H2
and stellar properties of galaxies in order to compare the
predictions with the corresponding observations eg Nor-
man  Spaans 1997 Leroy et al 2011 Saintonge et al
2011 Cortese et al 2012 Bourne et al 2013 In this
investigation we use a slightly revised version of our pre-
vious simulation code used in B13a
The plan of the paper is as follows In the next sec-
tion we describe initial conditions of galaxy formation and
chemodynamical model with the formation and evolution
of dust and H2 In 3 we present the numerical results
on the z-evolution of dust and H2 properties in simulated
galaxies In this section we also discuss correlations be-
tween dust properties eg D and global galaxy parame-
ters eg total stellar masses and their z-evolution In 4
we discuss the latest observational results on dust and H2
properties of galaxies derived mainly from the Herschel
and Spitzer telescopes and also point out necessary im-
provement in the predictive power of numerical simula-
tions with dust growth and destruction We summarize
our conclusions in 5 Physical meanings for symbols eg
D often used in the present study are given in Table 1 for
convenience
2 the model
We mainly investigate the zevolution of total dust and
H2 masses Mdust and MH2 respectively D mass frac-
tion of PAH dust qPAH from z  16 to z  0 by using
chemodynamical simulations of galaxy formation based on
a CDM cosmology with the latest WMAP cosmologi-
cal parameters Since the details of the simulation code
adopted in the present study and the results of various
tests of the code have been already given in B13a we here
briey describe the simulation code This study presents
the rst application of the new simulation code to galaxy
formation in a cosmological context Accordingly it is
still a preliminary one in which i a reasonable range of
dust parameters needs to be determined in the context of
CDM-based galaxy formation and ii a large-scale struc-
ture and formation processes of individual galaxies are not
self-consistently included ie not zoom-in simulations
Although a growing number of observational papers on
dust properties of local and distant galaxies have been pub-
lished many observational studies are currently underway
Therefore only a brief comparison between observations
and simulations can be done in the present study Ongo-
ing data analysis from Herschel and ALMA will produce a
large amount of key observational data that can be com-
pared with numerical simulations of galaxy formation with
dust and H2 models It is thus our future work to com-
pare extensively between more sophisticated simulations
and these observations
We use a slightly revised version of our previous simu-
lation code B13a in which hydrodynamics of interstellar
gas is modeled by the SPH method The previous simula-
tions in B13a include the formation of dust in the stellar
winds of supernovae SNe and asymptotic giant branch
AGB stars the growth and destruction processes of dust
in the interstellar medium ISM the formation of poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbon PAH dust in carbon-rich
AGB stars the H2 formation on dust grains and the H2
photo-dissociation due to far ultra-violet FUV light in a
self-consistent manner The revised version newly includes
i dust growth timescales dependent on dust properties
Yozin  Bekki 2014 and ii time-varying IMF models
Bekki  Meurer 2013 Bekki 2013bc B13b B13c These
new elements of the code are described later The code
can be currently run on Graphics Processing Unit GPU
clusters in which gravitational calculations are done on
GPUs whereas other calculations such as star formation
and chemical evolution are done on CPUs
The present improved code however does not allow us
to investigate the following physical properties of dust
First the time evolution of dust size distribution and de-
tailed dust compositions can not be investigated This is
because initial distributions of dust sizes and dust shat-
tering and coagulation processes which are key for the
evolution of dust grain sizes are not included Second
the dynamical evolution of dust can not be separately in-
vestigated from that of gas-phase metals ie metals that
are not locked up onto dust grains because dust-gas hy-
drodynamical interaction eg Theis  Orlova 2004 and
radiation pressure on dust grains eg Ferrara et al 1991
are not included Third the sub-pc scale physical pro-
cesses of dust destruction by SNe and grain-grain collisions
eg Shull 1978 McKee et al 1989 Jones et al 1994
Silvia et al 2010 can not be investigated by the present
galaxy-scale simulations because of the expected spatial
resolution at most 10pc These three will be included in
our future more sophisticated simulations
As shown later in this paper the simulated disk galax-
ies can have extended dusty gaseous halos Therefore the
total mass of dust in a simulated galaxy depends on the ra-
dius within which the masses of gas particles are summed
up A signicant fraction of dust in a galaxy can be lo-
cated in the outer halo Therefore we separately estimate
the total dust dust mass for disk and halo components of a
galaxy In the present study Mdust Mdustd and Mdusth
are referred to as the total masses of a galaxy that of
the disk R  R05 where R05 is the half-mass radius of
stars and that of the halo respectively
21 Gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics
One of key ingredients of the code is that the gravita-
tional softening length  is chosen for each component
in a galaxy ie multiple gravitational softening lengths
Thus the gravitational softening length  is dierent be-
tween dark matter dm and gas g and dm is deter-
mined by the initial mean separation of dark matter par-
ticles Initial g is set to be signicantly smaller than dm
owing to rather high-density thus high-number-density
gaseous regions formed during dissipative collapse and
merging of galaxy formation as is described later The
softening length for new stars formed from gas is set to be
the same as g Furthermore when two dierent compo-
nents interact gravitationally the mean softening length
for the two components is applied for the gravitational
calculation For example   dm  g2 is used for
gravitational interaction between
We consider that the ISM in galaxies can be modeled
as an ideal gas with the ratio of specic heats  being
53 The basic methods to implement SPH in the present
study are essentially the same as those proposed by Hern-
quist  Katz 1989 We adopt the predictor-corrector
algorithm that is accurate to second order in time and
space in order to integrate the equations describing the
time evolution of a system Each particle is allocated an in-
dividual time step width t that is determined by phys-
ical properties of the particle The maximum time step
width tmax is 001 in simulation units which means
that tmax  141  106 yr in the present study Al-
though a gas particle is allowed to have a minimum time
step width of 141  104 in the adopted individual time
step scheme no particle actually has such a short time
step width owing to conversion from gas to star in high-
density gas regions The radiative cooling processes are
properly included by using the cooling curve by Rosen 
Bregman 1995 for 100  Tg  104K where Tg is gas
temperature and the MAPPING III code for Tg  104K
Sutherland  Dopita 1993
In the present study thermal feedback eects of SN ex-
plosions can heat up ISM to form hot gas whereas radiative
cooling described above can contribute to the formation of
rather cold gas Tg  100K Therefore the inuences of
the multi-phase nature of ISM on dust evolution can be
investigated though the details of ISM evolution driven by
gas cooling and heating SNe and H2 formation on dust
grains are not discussed in the present paper Also dust
evolution can be inuenced by stellar winds of massive
stars and proto-stellar objects These potentially impor-
tant processes for dust evolution need to be investigated
in our future papers because the present simulations do
not have enough resolution to investigate this subpc-scale
dynamics The cosmic microwave background CMB ra-
diation eld can also inuence the evolution of cold gas and
thus that of interstellar dust in galaxies at higher redshifts
This CMB eects on ISM with dust are not considered in
the present study and therefore it is also a key issue that
should be investigated in our forthcoming papers
22 Chemical enrichment
Since the present model for chemical enrichment pro-
cesses of galaxies is exactly the same as that used in B13a
we briey describe the model here Chemical enrichment
through star formation and metal ejection from SNIa II
and AGB stars is self-consistently included in the chemo-
dynamical simulations We investigate the time evolution
of the 11 chemical elements of H He C N O Fe Mg
Ca Si S and Ba in order to predict both chemical abun-
dances and dust properties in the present study The mean
metallicity Z for each kth stellar particle is represented by
Zk The total mass of each jth j  1  11 chemical com-
ponent ejected from each kth stellar particles at time t is
given as
kjt  msk Ykj t  tk
where msk is the mass of the kth stellar particle Ykj t 
tk is the mass of each jth chemical component ejected
from stars per unit mass at time t and tk represents the
time when the kth stellar particle is born from a gas parti-
cle zej
kjt is given equally to neighbor SPH gas particles
with the total number of Nneik  located around the kth
stellar particle Therefore the mass increase of each jth
chemical component for ith gas particle at time t zej
ijt
is given as
ijt 
msk Ykj t  tkNneik 
where Nneii is the total number of neighbor stellar par-
ticles whose metals can be incorporated into the ith gas
particle We consider the time delay between the epoch
of star formation and those of supernova explosions and
commencement of AGB phases ie non-instantaneous re-
cycling of chemical elements
We adopt the prompt SN Ia model in which the delay
time distribution DTD of SNe Ia is consistent with re-
cent observational results by extensive SN Ia surveys eg
Mannucci et al 2006 In this prompt SN Ia mode there
is a time delay tIa between the star formation and the
metal ejection for SNe Ia We here adopt the following
DTD gtIa for 01 Gyr  tIa  10 Gyr which is consis-
tent with recent observational studies on the SN Ia rate in
extra-galaxies eg Maoz et al 2011
gIatIa  Cgt1
where Cg is a normalization constant that is determined
by the number of SN Ia per unit mass which is controlled
by the IMF and the binary fraction for intermediate-mass
stars for the adopted power-law slope of 1 This adop-
tion is pointed out to be necessary to explain the observed
chemical properties of the LMC Bekki  Tsujimoto 2012
The fraction of the stars that eventually produce SNe Ia
for 38M has not been observationally determined
the present study fb  005 is assumed We adopt the
nucleosynthesis yields of SNe II and Ia from Tsujimoto et
al 1995 T95 and AGB stars from van den Hoek  Groe-
newegen 1997 VG97 in order to estimate Ykj t  tk in
the present study
23 Dust model
The present models for dust yields growth and de-
struction are the same as those adopted in B13a which
reproduced reasonably well the observed dust properties
of galaxies in a self-consistent manner In B13a and the
present work the evolution of dust size distribution is not
considered at all though it can inuence the thermal evo-
lution of ISM and H2 formation eciency on dust grains
The total mass of jth component jC O Mg Si S Ca
and Fe of dust from kth type of stars k  I II and
AGB for SNe Ia SNe II and AGB stars respectively is
described as follows
dustj  k
cj Fejmk
ejj 
where k
is the condensation eciency ie the mass
fraction of metals that are locked up in dust grains for
each jth chemical component from kth stellar type Fej is
the function that determines the total mass of metals that
can be used for dust formation and mk
ejj is the mass of jth
component ejected from kth stellar type The total mass
of stellar ejecta is estimated by using stellar yield tables
by T95 and VG97 Dust yields are exactly the same as
those in B13a The details of k
ejj  are given
in B13a The inclusion of SN dust in the present model
is quite reasonable rstly because recent observations of
SN 1987a by Herschel have revealed a large amount of
dust 0407M in the SN Matsuura et al 2011 and
secondly because the observed amount appears to be con-
sistent with the theoretical prediction by Nozawa et al
2003
cj and Fejmk
Dust grains can grow by accretion of metals of ISM onto
preexisting cores and this accretion process is included in
previous models D98 Following D98 we consider that
the key parameter in dust accretion is the dust accretion
timescale a In the present study this parameter can
vary between dierent gas particles and is thus represented
by ai for ith gas particle The mass of jth component
jC O Mg Si S Ca and Fe of dust for ith gas parti-
cle at time t dijt can increase owing to dust accretion
processes The mass increase is described as
dacc
ij t  ti1  fdustij dij tai 
where ti is the individual time step width for the ith
gas particle and fdustij is the fraction of the jth chemi-
cal element that is locked up in the dust Owing to this
dust growth the mass of jth chemical component that is
not locked up in the dust zijt can decrease which is
simply given as
zacc
ij t  ti1  fdustij dijtai
As is clear in these equations the total mass of jth com-
ponent in ith gas particle mij t is zijt  dij t
Dust grains can be destroyed though supernova blast
waves in the ISM of galaxies eg McKee 1989 and the
destruction process is parameterized by the destruction
time scale d in previous one-zone models eg Lisen-
feld  Ferrara 1998 Hirashita 1999 Following the previ-
ous models the decrease of the mass of jth component of
dust for ith gas particle at time t due to dust destruction
process is as follows
ddest
where di is the dust destruction timescale for ith parti-
cle The dust destroyed by supernova explosions can be
returned back to the ISM and therefore the mass of jth
chemical component that is not locked up in the dust in-
creases as follows
ij t  tidijtdi 
Thus the equation for the time evolution of jth compo-
ij t  tidijtdi
zdest
nent of metals for ith gas particle are given as
zijt  ti  zijt  zej
ij t  zdest
Likewise the equation for dust evolution is given as
ijt  zacc
ij t 9
dijt  ti  dijt  dacc
Dust is locked up in stars as metals are done so when gas
particles are converted into new stars This means that
star formation process itself has an eect of destroying
dust in the present study

A growing number of observational studies on PAH
properties have been accumulated for galaxies within and
beyond the Local Group eg Draine et al 2007 Meixner
et al 2010 It is accordingly timely for the present study
to discuss the origin of the observed PAH properties in
galaxies by using the new chemodynamical model The
most promising formation site of interstellar PAH dust
is C-rich AGB stars though direct observation support-
ing PAH formation in stellar winds of AGB stars is very
weak eg Tielens 2008 for a recent review We con-
sider that some fraction of carbon dust produced by C-
rich AGB stars CO  1 can nally become PAH dust
and thereby investigate the PAH properties in the present
study The mass fraction of PAH dust to total carbon dust
in the ejecta of C-rich AGB stars is a parameter denoted
as RPAH Using low-resolution simulations with dierent
RPAH we nd that RPAH  005 can better explain obser-
vations We therefore show the results of the models with
RPAH  005 in the present study As shown in B13a the
time evolution of PAH is not dierent between low- and
high-resolution simulations for RPAH  005
We adopt an assumption that the dust accretion and
dust destruction timescales are the same between PAH
and other dust Therefore the parameter values of a
and d are exactly the same between PAH and other dust
We adopt this assumption mainly because it is observa-
tionally and theoretically unclear how dierent the dust
growth and destruction processes are between PAH and
other dust
It is likely however that PAH can be de-
stroyed probably more eciently by gas shocks and SNe
than other dust owing to their much lower masses This
dierence in dust destruction processes between dierent
dust gains should be included in our future more sophisti-
cated models We accordingly admit that the PAH model
is over-simplied to some extent but we consider that the
PAH evolution does not inuence the time evolution of
Mdust and D that are the main focus of this paper be-
cause MPAH is much smaller than Mdust In the present
paper we do not want to introduce additional few param-
eters to model the PAH evolution and more sophisticated
PAH models should be discussed in our future papers The
evolution of PAH dust with time and metallicity in galax-
ies was already investigated in detail by Galliano et al
2008 Also Micelotta et al 2010a b investigated the
eects of hot gas and gaseous shock waves on the evolution
of PAH and estimated the lifetime and destruction process
of PAH dust
We investigate the time evolution of the mass-ratio of
PAH dust to total dust for each i-th gas particle at each
time step and the mass-ratio qPAHi  is dened as follows
qPAHi 
mdusti
where mdusti is the sum of all dust elements and mPAHi
is the total mass of PAH dust for the gas particle The
present dust model is not so realistic as the one proposed
recently by Jones et al 2013 which considered the evo-
lution of hydrocarbon materials inuenced by ultraviolet
photon We do not consider such a detailed dust model in
the present study because the simulation code does not
allow us to investigate the evolution of dust compositions
due to photon absorption-induced processing We will con-
sider the new model by Jones et al 2013 in our future
24 Dierent dust depletion levels in dierent elements
Gas-phase chemical abundances relative to solar in the
Galactic ISM are observed to be quite dierent between
dierent elements eg Savage et al 1992 For example
Fe Ca and Ti are severely dust-depleted ie almost all
Fe Ca and Ti are locked up in dust whereas N and S do
not show such dust depletion Therefore chemical abun-
dance ratios such as SFe and SCa can be used to
measure the dust depletion level of an individual gaseous
region in a galaxy Dierent dust depletion levels between
dierent elements reect the fact that the required physi-
cal conditions for metals to be locked up in dust are dier-
ent between the dierent elements Although the present
study does not develop a detailed model for this dierent
dust depletion level it adopts a simple model in which
only the element S is free from dust depletion Accord-
ingly the radial gradient of SH in a galaxy can be re-
garded as a metallicity gradient that is not inuenced by
dust depletion thus it can correspond to the AO gradient
of ionized gaseous regions Furthermore we can measure
the dust depletion level of a galaxy by investigating the
mean SFe in the present study because the element Fe
is dust-depleted
We investigate the time evolution of the dust-to-metal-
ratios fdusti  for each i-th gas particle at each time step
and it is dened as follows
fdusti 
mdusti
where mZi is the sum of all metal elements ie metals
in gas and those locked up in dust The mean dust-to-
metal-ratio of a galaxy is the mean of these fdusti for all
gas particle of the galaxy
It is observationally dicult
to estimate these fdust Therefore we show both SFe
and fdust in the present study The initial dust-to-metal
ratio is xed at 01 at zi for all gaseous particles in all
models and the present results do not depend strongly on
this initial ratio The initial dust and metal are assumed
to originate from Pop III SNe eg Nozawa et al 2003
25 Constant vs variable dust accretion models
Dust growth timescale in ISM of galaxies is a fundamen-
tally important not only in investigating the time evolu-
tion of mean D in galaxies eg D98 but also in dis-
cussing the physical properties of H2 gas B13a We
investigate the following two models for estimating the
dust growth timescale One is the constant dust accre-
tion model CDA in which a is constant for all particles
at all time steps and the other is the variable dust accre-
tion model VDA in which a is dierent between dier-
ent particles with dierent gaseous properties and changes
with time according to the changes of gaseous properties
Previous one-zone models eg D98 and our previous nu-
merical simulations B13a adopted CDA and thereby dis-
cussed the observed key observational results of dust prop-
erties in galaxies Clearly VDA is more realist than CDA
in investigating dust and H2 properties of galaxies
However we need to introduce a few additional parame-
ters in VDA in order to describe the possible dependences
of a of gas particles on the gas densities temperature
and chemical abundances Given that the additional pa-
rameters for a are not well constrained VDA could be
practically less useful in pinpointing the key physics for
the time evolution of dust properties Furthermore our
previous simulations with CDA clearly show the impor-
tance of dust accretion and destruction in the evolution of
D and fH2 We therefore consider that it is the best for the
present study to investigate the z-evolution of dust and H2
properties of galaxies by using both CDA and VDA
For CDA ai of each gas particle is xed at a certain
value for all time steps and described as follows
ai  a
where a ranges from 001 Gyr to 05 Gyr in the present
study For CDA di of each gas particle is also xed at
a certain value and assumed to be proportional to ai as
follows
di  d  da
where d is a free parameter and d  2 for a  025 Gyr
is the best value for reproducing dust and H2 properties of
galaxies in B13a We can nd a reasonable range of d by
comparing the observed dust and H2 properties with the
simulated ones for dierent d
We adopt the following dependence of ai on the mass
density and temperature of a gas particle
ai  a0
where gi and Tgi are the gas density and temperature of
a i-th gas particle respectively a0 typical ISM density
at the solar neighborhood and Tg0 temperature of cold
gas are set to be 1 atom cm3 and 20K respectively and
a0 is a reference dust accretion timescale at g0 and Tg0
The adopted 108 yr for the dust timescale of typical ISM
is consistent with those used for typical ISM in previous
studies eg 25  108 yr in D98 The present simulations
can not resolve the atomic-scale physics of dust growth
much smaller than the possible resolution of the present
simulations and the above ai for a gas particle should
be regarded as the dust growth timescale averaged over
the smoothing length of the particle 10  100 pc Fur-
thermore the functional form of a in the above equation
can be derived from the rst principle See equations 30
31 and 34 in D98 and 19 and 20 in Hirashita 2012
This a0 can control the dust accretion timescale of the
i-th gas particle and is set to be 108 yr in the present study
The adopted function form of ai is consistent with the
analytical formula estimated by D98 see equations 30 31
and 34 in D98 Since the size and mass distributions of
dust grains can determine a0 adopting a xed value of
a0 would be less realistic We cannot help but to adopt
a xed a0 value simply because the present simulations
do not allow us to investigate the size and mass distribu-
tions of dust grains in galaxies We have investigated how
the present results depend on a0 by running some models
with longer a0 It is conrmed that if a0 is as large as
109 yr then the observed dust properties can not be well
reproduced by the present models We therefore show the
results of the models with a0  108 yr
Previous numerical simulations revealed physical condi-
tions for dust destruction by SNF and the dust destruction
eciencies dependent on physical properties of ISM eg
Jones et al 1994 Nozawa et al 2003 Although di
could be described as a function of gas properties by us-
ing the results of these simulations we adopt the same
model in CDA for the dust destruction timescale in VDA
This is mainly because an analytical formula for the dust
destruction eciencies and timescales dependent on ISM
properties has not been clearly described yet The dust
destruction timescale of a gas particle depends both on
d and ai  which means that the timescale can be deter-
mined locally for each gas particle The d value is xed
at 2 for most models with VDA unless specied in the
present study In our future work we will try to develop a
better and more sophisticated model for dust destruction
by including the results of the above previous numerical
simulations properly in our chemodynamical simulations
The SPH smoothing length h of a particle which can
dene the resolution of a local gaseous region is changed
according to the gas density of the particle ie time-
dependent dynamic resolution Therefore the h value
can be rather small in some high-density region of a model
in particular where star formation is suppressed The
density of a SPH gas particle can be therefore as high
as 104 cm3 which is already discussed in B13a Fur-
thermore the H2 formation site is almost always in high-
density and dust-rich regions which means that dust
growth is the most rapid in the forming H2 regions ac-
cording to the adopted density-temperature-dependent
dust accretion timescale
Also it should be stressed that the destruction of H2
gas by supernova or high-intensity UV radiation eld
is included already in this paper For example the H2
abundance is lower in the model with strong SN feedback
because SN feedback eects can disperse ISM and lower
the gas density so that H2 formation can be suppressed
In such a low-density region dust-growth is suppressed
in the present simulation owing to the adopted density-
dependent dust accretion timescale
26 H2 formation and dissociation
The model for H2 formation and dissociation in the
present study is exactly the same as those used in B13a H2
formation on dust grains and H2 dissociation by FUV radi-
ation are both self-consistently included in chemodynam-
ical simulations The temperature Tg hydrogen den-
sity H dust-to-gas ratio D of a gas particle and the
strength of the FUV radiation eld  around the gas
particle are calculated at each time step so that the frac-
tion of molecular hydrogen fH2 for the gas particle can
be derived based on the H2 formationdestruction equilib-
rium conditions Thus the H2 fraction for i-th gas particle
fH2i  is given as
fH2i  F Tgi  Hi  Di i
where F means a function for fH2i determination
Since the detail of the derivation methods of i and fH2i
thus F  are given in B13a and B13b we here briey de-
scribe the methods The SEDs of stellar particles around
each i-th gas particles thus ISRF are rst estimated from
ages and metallicities of the stars by using stellar popu-
lation synthesis codes for a given IMF eg Bruzual 
Charlot 2003 Then the strength of the FUV-part of the
ISRF is estimated from the SEDs so that i can be derived
for the i-th gas particle Based on i Di and Hi of the
gas particle we can derive fH2i See Figure 1 in B13a
Thus each gas particle has fH2i  metallicity FeH and
gas density all of which are used for estimating the IMF
slopes for the particle when it is converted into a new
Since the formation and evolution processes of dust and
H2 are strongly coupled in the present study the model pa-
rameters of dust need to be carefully chosen so that both
the observed H2 and dust properties can be well repro-
duced by the models The present model can explain the
observed positive correlation between hydrostatic gas pres-
sure Pgas and the ratio of H2 to H i Rmol which can be
denoted as Rmol  R092
gas eg Blitz et al 2007 Further-
more the dust-regulated H2 formation model can explain
the observed correlations between local surface densities
of dust and H2 in galaxies The origin of these H2 proper-
ties will be discussed in detail by our forthcoming papers
in which the same dust-regulated H2 formation model is
adopted eg Bekki 2014
27 Star formation and SN feedback eects
Since SF can proceed in molecular clouds we adopt the
following H2-dependent SF recipe B13a using molecu-
lar gas fraction fH2  dened for each gas particle in the
present study A gas particle can be converted into a new
star if i the local dynamical time scale is shorter than
the sound crossing time scale mimicking the Jeans insta-
bility  ii the local velocity eld is identied as being
consistent with gravitationally collapsing ie div v 0
and iii the local density exceeds a threshold density for
star formation th We mainly investigate the models
with th  1 cm3 in the present study
A gas particle can be regarded as a SF candidate gas
particle if the above three SF conditions i-iii are satis-
ed It could be possible to convert some fraction  fH2
of a SF candidate gas particle into a new star at each time
step until the mass of the gas particle becomes very small
However this SF conversion method can increase dramat-
ically the total number of stellar particles which becomes
numerically very costly We therefore adopt the following
SF conversion method A SF candidate i-th gas particle
is regarded as having a SF probability Psf 
Psf  1  expCefH2 tsf 1
where Ce corresponds to a star formation eciency SFE
in molecular cores and is set to be 1 t is the time step
width for the gas particle  is the gas density of the par-
is the power-law slope of the Kennicutt-
ticle and sf
Schmidt law SFR sf
g  Kennicutt 1998 A reasonable
value of sf  15 is adopted in the present study This
SF probability has been already introduced in our early
chemodynamical simulations of galaxies eg Bekki  Sh-
ioya 1998
At each time step random numbers Rsf  0  Rsf  1
are generated and compared with Psf  If Rsf  Psf  then
the gas particle can be converted into a new stellar one
In this SF recipe a gas particle with a higher gas density
and thus a shorter SF timescale     1sf  can be
more rapidly converted into a new star owing to the larger
Psf  Equally a gas particle with a higher fH2 can be more
rapidly converted into a new star We thus consider that
the present SF model is a good approximation for star
formation in molecular gas of disk galaxies
Each SN is assumed to eject the feedback energy Esn
of 1051 erg and 90 and 10 of Esn are used for the in-
crease of thermal energy thermal feedback and random
motion kinematic feedback respectively The thermal
energy is used for the adiabatic expansion phase where
each SN can remain adiabatic for a timescale of tadi Al-
though tadi  105 yr is reasonable for a single SN ex-
plosion previous galaxy-scale simulations adopted a much
longer timescale of  107 yr eg Mori et al 1999 Stinson
et al 2006 Multiple SN explosions can occur for a gas
particle with a mass of 105M in these galaxy-scale simu-
lations and tadi can be dierent for multiple SN explosions
in a small local region owing to complicated interaction be-
tween gaseous ejecta from dierent SNe Such interaction
of multiple SN explosions would make the adiabatic phase
signicantly longer in real ISM of galaxies
Considering these we adopt the following three dierent
tadi for modeling SN feedbackSNF 3  106 yr referred
to as weak SNF 107 yr moderate SNF and 3  107
yr strong SNF We compare the results of these three
model with one another to demonstrate the importance
of SNF in the z-evolution of dust properties in galaxies
The energy-ratio of thermal to kinematic feedback is con-
sistent with previous numerical simulations by Thornton
et al 1998 who investigated the energy conversion pro-
cesses of SNe in detail The way to distribute Esn of SNe
among neighbor gas particles is the same as described in
28 Fixed and time-varying IMFs
We investigate the dust evolution of galaxies with the
xed Kroupa IMF eg Kroupa 2001 for most models in
the present study However as shown in B13b the time
evolution of dust can be quite dierent between xed and
time-varying IMFs Therefore we adopt the time-varying
IMF dependent on local gaseous properties ie metal-
licities and H2 densities and thereby investigate the dif-
ferences in dust and H2 evolution between the xed and
time-varying IMFs The three IMFs slopes i i  1
2 and 3 in the Kroupa IMF for each gas particle in the
adopted time-varying IMF depend on the physical prop-
erties of the gas particle as follows
i  FiFeH H2 
where FeH and H2 are the metallicity and H2 density of
the gas particle and the functional forms are dierent be-
tween dierent i ie dierent mass ranges of the IMF
The adopted IMF form means that the metallicity of a
star-forming gas cloud plays a decisive role in controlling
IMF The details of the functional form F  and the possi-
ble physical eects of the adopted varying IMF on galaxy
evolution are given and discussed in B13b Although we
think that the time-varying IMF is a very important fac-
tor for the z-evolution of dust properties in galaxies we
present the results for just one set of models with the two
IMFs This is simply because our main focus is not the
roles of IMFs in galaxy formation and evolution in the
present study
29 Initial conditions
The present study is the very rst step toward better
understand the z-evolution of dust properties in galaxies
based on a CDM cosmology Therefore we adopt ide-
alized initial conditions of galaxy formation based on a
CDM model thereby determine the reasonable ranges of
key parameters for dust growth and destruction and in-
vestigate dust properties of simulated galaxies Recent
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy for-
mation have adopted the zoom-in technique to achieve
enough spatial resolution to investigate individual galax-
ies in a large-scale cosmological initial condition eg the
Eris simulation Guedes et al 2011 The present study
does not perform such a zoom-in cosmological simulation
rstly because it is extremely time-consuming to deter-
mine the parameter ranges of dust growth and destruction
by running a large number of zoom-in simulations and sec-
ondly because the adopted GPU-based simulation code is
yet to be well developed for massively parallel GPU clus-
ters essential for such zoom-in high-resolution simulations
Cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation will
be done in our future studies for a reasonable range of dust
parameters derived in the present study
The way to set up initial conditions for galaxy for-
mation is essentially the same as that adopted by early
numerical studies of galaxy formation based on a CDM
model Katz 1992 Steinmetz  Muller 1995 Bekki 
Chiba 2000 Kawata  Gibson 2003 We consider an
isolated homogeneous rigidly rotating sphere on which
small-scale initial uctuations are superimposed accord-
ing to a CDM power spectrum We use the soft-
ware GRAFIC Gaussian Random Fields for Cosmolog-
ical Simulations Bertschinger 1995 2001 in order to gen-
erate initial conditions of galaxy formation We adopt
a WMAP7 CDM cosmology with m  b h n 8
027207280046070409670810 Komatsu et al
2011 for all simulations The starting redshift zi for
a simulation is determined by GRAFIC for the above cos-
mological parameters and the adopted initial mass size
and particle number of a galaxy Typically zi is  16 in
the present study
The three basic parameters in the present study are the
initial total halo mass Mh spin parameter  and mass
density h The spin parameter  is dened as
where J E and G are the total angular momentum of
a galaxy the total energy of the galaxy and the gravita-
tional constant We mainly investigate the models with
  002 006 and 01 In order to discuss the origin of
the observed metallicity-dust relation AO  D of galax-
ies we investigate the models with dierent Mh ranging
from 3  109M to 1012M Furthermore we investigate
the models with rather high h so that we can discuss the
origin of dust in high-z QSOs
210 Low- and high-resolution simulations
One of the main purpose of the present study is to deter-
mine the reasonable range of dust parameters for numeri-
cal simulations of galaxy formation The determined dust
parameters will be able to be adopted for future more so-
phisticated zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation Ow-
ing to the limited amount of computing time allocated
for the project for the present GPU-based simulations we
need to take the two-fold strategy First we run a large
number of low-resolution simulations N  2  105 for
dierent dust models and SNF so that we can determine
the reasonable range of dust parameters Then we run
high-resolution N  106 simulations to investigate the
dust properties of the simulated galaxies and present the
preliminary results In this second set of high-resolution
simulations we try to conrm that the derived dust pa-
rameters can explain observations reasonably well The
total numbers of dark matter and baryon particles which
are denoted as Ndm and Nb respectively are the same for
all simulations ie Ndm  Nb
The low-resolution models with Mh  1012M and
  006 are investigated for dierent dust parameters
so that the nal D qPAH and fH2 can be compared with
the corresponding observations for the MW The initial ra-
dius in a comoving coordinate Rh and the total particle
number N  are set to be 157 Mpc and 282454 respec-
tively ie x cell size of 0049 Mpc in the GRAFIC
code in the low-resolution models The values of dm
and g are 162 kpc and 0162 kpc respectively and the
mass resolution is mdm  59  106M for the dark matter
halo and mb  10  106M for the baryonic component
gas For the high-resolution models we mainly investi-
gate the ducial model corresponding to the formation
of the MW and the parameter values are given in Table
2 The ducial model has N  1041636 Mh  1012M
Rh  159 Mpc in a comoving coordinate   006
dm  093 kpc g  0093 kpc mdm  16  106M and
mb  27  105M
The initial masses and sizes of galaxy formation for high-
resolution models mainly investigated in the present study
are summarized in Table 3 The mass- and size-resolutions
are dierent between models with dierent Mh and Rh for
the adopted constant N  1041636 We investigate the
high-resolution models with both CDA and VDA and dif-
ferent SNF ie weak moderate and strong We inves-
tigate the roles of time-varying IMFs in the z-evolution of
dust and H2 properties only for the ducial model in the
present study The parameter ranges investigated in the
present study are summarized in Table 4
211 Choice of a and d
As shown in previous one-zone chemical evolution mod-
els eg D98 and numerical simulations B13a the most
important parameters for the time evolution of dust are
a and d Furthermore these two parameters can control
the time evolution of H2 mass fractions fH2  in galaxies
Therefore we need to choose carefully these two param-
eters in order to reproduce not only dust properties but
also cold gas contents of galaxies in a self-consistent man-
ner We therefore rst determine the reasonable ranges
of these two parameters by running many low-resolution
models with dierent a and d Then we try to conrm
the selected dust parameters can explain the observed D
and fH2 of the MW in the high-resolution models
We compare the observed D qpah and fH2 with those
of the Milky-Way MW models in which model parame-
ters for initial conditions of galaxy formation are chosen
for the MW formation The time evolution of dust prop-
erties can be strongly inuenced by the modeling of SNF
because dust destruction by SNe is included in the present
simulations We therefore investigate how the dust and
H2 properties of galaxies depend on modeling of SNF in
the low-resolution MW models too For comparison we
run models i with dust growth W-grow yet without
dust destruction WO-dest ii without dust growth
WO-grow and without dust destruction and without
dust growth and with dust destruction W-dest
Figure 1 shows the comparison between the simulated
locations of disk galaxies at z  0 on the D  fH2 and
D  qPAH planes with the corresponding observations for
the MW The observational data points are from Draine
 Li 2006 Zubko et al
2004 and Nakanishi et al
2003 2006
It should be noted here that there is an
uncertainty in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor X-factor
in estimating MH2 Nakanishi et al 2006 Both a con-
stant X-factor of 18  1020 H2 cm2 K1 kms1 and
radial-dependent X-factor are adopted for the estimation
of the total H2 mass of the Galaxy in Nakanishi et al
2006 The observational error bar of fH2 indicates the
possible range of fH2 for a factor of 50 changes in the
X-factor The real range of the X-factor dierence could
be even larger than 50 The two left panes with same
dust parameters a  025 Gyr and d  05 Gyr yet
dierent SNF models clearly show that the nal D fH2
and qPAH are higher for weak SNF Star formation is less
strongly suppressed in the models with weak SNF so that
chemical evolution and dust enrichment can proceed more
eciently Dust is less eciently destroyed in these mod-
els so that H2 formation can proceed more rapidly in these
models As a result of these fH2 can be nally larger in
these models
It appears that the model with moderate SNF can bet-
ter reproduce the observed locations of the MW on the
two planes However as shown in B13a the evolution of
D and fH2 depends slightly on spatial resolution and mini-
mum time step width of simulations Therefore this result
can not be taken as a face value and we need to conrm
the dependences of D evolution on SNF modeling later in
the high-resolution models In the adopted PAH models
the nal qPAH appears to be slightly smaller than the ob-
served one for the three SNF models The mass fraction of
Carbon metals from C-rich AGB stars that can be locked
up onto dust grains is assumed to be 005 in these mod-
els because our previous models with this number 005
could better explain the observed qPAH of the MW If a
larger value of this lock-up fraction is adopted the nal
qPAH can be larger and thus closer to the observation
The right two panels in Figure 1 shows that if dust de-
struction is not included the nal D and fH2 can be too
large to be consistent with observations Furthermore
if dust growth is not included then the nal D is too
small to be consistent with observations irrespective of
whether dust destruction is included or not These three
non-standard models also show too small qPAH at their
nal D These results clearly demonstrate that both dust
growth and destruction need to be included properly in
numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution
for self-consistent reproduction of D fH2 and qPAH in the
The left two panes in Figure 2 shows that as long as
d  2a the time evolution and the locations of the sim-
ulated galaxies on the D fH2 and Mdust MH2 planes are
reasonable for a  0125 Gyr and 025 Gyr For the model
with a  0125 Gyr fH2 and MH2 at the nal D are rea-
sonable too even for d  4a These results for galaxy for-
mation based on a CDM model are consistent with those
in B13a in which simplied initial conditions of galaxy for-
mation through gravitational collapse are adopted How-
ever the models with d  a for a  025 Gyr and 05
Gyr show a very strange behavior in the sense that fH2
and D decrease from some points owing to the too rapid
destruction of dust grains by SNF This behavior of dust
and H2 content evolution can not be realistic and such
models with d  a should be rejected These results
demonstrate that the ratio of dust growth to destruction
timescales is a key for the evolution of dust and H2 and
thus carefully chosen in numerical simulations of galaxy
formation and evolution
The right two panes in Figure 2 shows that even if
d  2a the models with rather short a 001 Gyr
and 0025 Gyr can show i an unrealistic behavior in the
time evolution of galaxies on the two planes and ii the
nal fH2 inconsistent with observations The origin for the
rapid decrease of fH2 and D is that SNF can more rapidly
destroy dust grains than SNe and AGB can produce dust
These results demonstrate that not only the timescale ra-
tio of dust growth and destruction but also the timescale
of dust growth is important for the time evolution dust
and H2 properties of galaxies
It should be noted here
that a larger desta  8 is required for the models with
a  0025 Gyr to show a realistic behavior of dust and H2
content evolution However the models with short a yet
high da show a slightly too large nal log D  18
owing to too rapid growth of dust We thus consider that
such models with rather short a would not be so realistic
for dust and H2 evolution of galaxies

31 Redshift evolution of dust and H2 contents
Figures 3 and 4 show the z-evolution of the projected
dust mass densities distributions dust and the nal dis-
tributions of stars with dierent ages and metallicities
respectively for the ducial model with Mh  1012M
  006 the xed IMF and the standard CDA Dust
densities can become higher in subgalactic clumps at high
z 35  z  16 owing to the growth of pre-galactic dust
grains ie dust from Pop III stars assumed in this sim-
ulation Many dusty subgalactic clumps are connected
with one another by low density lamentary structures
at z  35 which appears to be a cosmic web of dusty
gaseous regions Star formation at this stage is not ac-
tive so that the increase of dust abundances due to metal
ejection from SNe and AGB stars can not occur eciently
The interstellar dust of this forming galaxy can rapidly
grow during early disk formation through dissipative merg-
ing of dusty gas clumps z  18 The dust densities are
higher in the inner regions of subgalactic clumps where
star formation from H2 gas clouds is ongoing very e-
ciently so that dust production rates from SNe and AGB
stars can be very high The merging of these clumps trig-
ger starbursts in the forming galactic gas disk and conse-
quently chemical and dust enrichment processes can pro-
ceed very rapidly As a result of this the dust surface
densities in the central regions of the disk can become sig-
nicantly higher z  14
The 2D dust distribution shows an intriguing outer
ring-like structure and the disk has many isolated dusty
clumps in its outer halo region at z  04 The nal galaxy
consists of three spatially dierent components thin and
thick disks and old stellar halo at z  0 as already shown
in early chemodynamical simulations of disk galaxy for-
mation eg Steinmetz  Muller 1995 Bekki  Chiba
2000 Brook et al 2004 The age-metallicity relation
ie higher FeH for younger ages can be clearly seen
in this model and the nal stellar FeH at z  0 is con-
sistent with the observed solar value Since the origin
of these dierent components of disk galaxies with dier-
ent age and metallicity distribution functions have been
discussed in many simulations already we do not discuss
these in the present study
Figure 5 shows that although the z-evolution of Mg is
not so rapid the dust-to-gas-ratio D can dramatically
increase during the early disk formation z  1  3 via
dissipative merging of gas-rich subgalactic clumps for the
xed IMF model This strong D increase can be seen
also in the z-evolution of Mdust and thus is in a striking
contrast with the recent observational result that high-
z submillimeter galaxies appear to have Mdust similar to
the optically selected SDSS galaxies at lower z D11 The
slow and steady increase of D at z  4 is due simply to the
dust growth via accretion of gas-phase pre-galactic metals
onto already existing dust ie not due to the production
of dust from active star formation at high z
The total dust mass Mdust  Mdustd  Mdusth in
the models with weak SNF and CDA can be signicantly
larger than 108M owing to the less ecient dust destruc-
tion by SN and dust growth in every gas particle As
discussed later the total dust mass of a galaxy at z  0
depends on the modeling of SNF and dust models CDA
or VDA As a result of larger Mdust the nal D in this
model is higher than the observed D of the MW In this
high-mass model the formation of small dwarf galaxies at
very high z can not be well resolved owing to the adopted
particle number so that the production of dust from SNe
and AGB stars can be underestimated in the high-z sub-
galactic clumps As a results of this the formation of H2
on dust grains can abruptly become very ecient at z  4
and the time evolution of MH2 and fH2 are very steep
around z  4
The total stellar mass M increases more sharply at
z  2 when both the SFR and sSFR ie SFRM are
rather high In the later phase of disk formation z  2
M can grow slowly which means that MdustM does not
change so much at lower z owing to the slow change of
Mdust The sSFR can be higher at higher z when gas-
rich low-mass building blocks merge with one another to
form new stars quite eciently The presence of a peak in
the z-evolution of the SFR in this model is in a striking
contrast with no peak in that of the sSFR It should be
stressed here that both Mdust and M are the total masses
of dust and stars respectively The total dust mass within
the disk Mdustd is signicantly smaller than Mdust owing
to the presence of dusty gaseous halos
It is intriguing that the z-evolution of fH2 shows two
peaks at z  28 earlier and z  08 later The rst
peak corresponds to the most active star-formation phase
of massive subgalactic clumps where chemicaldust en-
richment processes and thus H2 formation on dust grains
are eectively ongoing During dissipative merging of gas-
rich subgalactic clumps at the early disk formation H2 gas
can be rapidly consumed by starburst in the gas disk so
that fH2 and MH2 can become slightly smaller After the
rst peak gradual accretion of gas and the subsequent star
formation can cause dust enrichment and thus eective H2
formation on dust grains so that fH2 can again start in-
creasing Further H2 consumption by star formation in
the disk can decrease fH2 again which ends up with the
second peak
It is clear that the z-evolution of Mg D M and fH2
can be signicantly dierent between the xed and time-
varying IMF models During the disk formation with ac-
tive star formation the IMF can become more top-heavy
so that a larger amount of metals can be produced and
then recycled into ISM of the forming disk for the time-
varying IMF Consequently a larger amount of dust can
be retained in the disk and a larger amount of H2 gas can
be processed on dust grains The nal D and fH2 can
be accordingly larger in the time-varying IMF than in the
xed IMF These intriguing dierences in the time evolu-
tion of D and fH2 have been already reported in B13b for
disk galaxy evolution
It should be noted also that the
nal Mg is smaller in the time-varying IMF which means
that stronger SNF due to more top-heavy IMF in active
SF regions can suppress the gas consumption by star for-
mation in the model The more severe suppression of SF
in the time-varying IMF ie slower gas consumption can
be therefore conrmed in the present study based on the
CDM model The present study conrmed that this dif-
ferent evolution between the xed and time-varying IMFs
is possible in the disk galaxy formation based on a CDM
model The basic behaviors of D and fH2 evolution eg
two peaks and rapid evolution in disk formation are es-
sentially the same between the two IMF models
Figure 6 shows that the z-evolution of D and and qPAH
depend more strongly on the initial mass densities of dark
matter halos than on the spin parameters  for a given
total mass The steep D and qPAH increases come earlier
in the model with the higher initial dark matter density
mainly because star formation and the subsequent chemi-
cal and dust enrichment processes can start in subgalactic
clumps earlier in the model The observed large Mdust and
D at a high-z QSO SDSS J11485251 z  64 however
can not be reproduced even by the high-density model in
which Mdust and D can start increasing at z  8 This
would mean that the dusty QSO at z  64 can be formed
from very rare high-density peak and dust growth can be
more rapid than the present model predicts The origin
of this QSO has been discussed by previous works eg
Dwek et al 2007 Valiante et at 2012 We accordingly
do not discuss the origin of this object in detail in the
present paper
Figure 7 conrms that the z-evolution of D depends
both on the modeling of SNF and on dust growth and de-
struction parameters The nal D can be larger in the
model with weak SNF mainly because chemical and dust
enrichment can proceed more eciently owing to a larger
amount of gas being converted into new stars in the model
The timescale ratio of d to a is important and should be
as large as 2 so that the nal D can be within a reason-
able range log D  2 for the MW-type disk galaxies
The models with d  a shows unrealistically small nal
log D  3 at z  0 because dust can be very rapidly
destroyed by SNF in these models These conrm the re-
sults of the low-resolution models shown in Figure 2
Figure 8 shows that Mdust can more sharply increase in
more massive forming disk galaxies and the nal D can
be larger in the more massive galaxies All of these three
disk galaxies with dierent masses show the two peaks
in MH2 evolution though the second later peak is less
clearly seen than the rst earlier one The low mass
model Mh  1010M has a less pronounced second peak
in fH2 evolution which is in a striking contrast with other
two more massive models the rst peak in the low mass
model is around z  55 which is outside the range of the
plot in Figure 8 The rst peak in fH2 evolution comes
earlier in forming disk galaxies with lower masses owing
to the earlier gravitational collapse These results suggest
that more massive galaxies can have larger D and fH2 at
32 AO  D relation
321 Constant Dust accretion model
Figure 9 shows that the metallicity-dust AO  D rela-
tion can be clearly seen in the models with CDA and weak
SNF though the relation appears to be signicantly shal-
lower than the observation The simulated range of AO is
narrower than the observed one in spite of the investigated
large range of initial halo masses 1010  MhM  1012
The models with strong SNF show wider ranges of AO and
D than those with weak SNF and thus better reproduce
the observed AO  D relation However the simulated
slope in the AO  D relation is similar to that in the mod-
els with weak SNF and thus appears to be less consistent
with observations though the observation shows a large
scatter in D at a given AO
Furthermore these two models with CDA show signi-
cantly higher D at AO  8 than the observed which means
that the present simulations overestimate D in low-mass
galaxies for some reasons A possible reason for this will be
discussed later in 4 Thus although the present models
with CDA and dierent SNF demonstrate that the origin
of the metallicity-dust relation can be closely associated
with the dierent eectiveness of SNF in galaxies with dif-
ferent masses the observed steeper relation and the large
dispersion at a given AO are not well reproduced by the
models
322 Variable dust accretion model
CDA dust models assume that the dust growth time
scale for each gas particle depends only on the gas-
phase metal abundance Therefore dust can grow with a
timescale of dust growth inversely proportional to the gas-
phase metal abundance ie more rapid growth for higher
gas-phase metal abundances even if the density of a gas
particle is low Consequently D can increase with time
for all particles irrespective of their gas density and tem-
perature as long as the particles have metals This way
of dust growth in CDA models might not be so realistic in
real galaxy formation and evolution though CDA models
were adopted in almost all previous models of dust evolu-
tion and successful in reproducing the mean dust proper-
ties of galaxies eg D98 Hirashita 1999 B13ab The
dust growth timescale in a gas cloud depends not only on
the gas-phase metal abundance but also the temperature
and density of gas cloud Therefore it is possible that dust
growth can be suppressed in low-density gaseous regions
and outer halo gas in galaxies
Figure 10 shows the locations of galaxies on the AO  D
plane at z  16 initial 2 1 and 0 present in VDA with
strong SNF for Mh  1012M 1010M and 3  109M
The nal D of less massive galaxies at z  0 becomes lower
in these VDA than in CDA so that the AO D relation can
be steeper A larger amount of gas metals and dust can
be ejected from low-mass galaxies during galaxy formation
through SN winds caused by strong SNF The ejected gas
can have lower gas density so that dust growth can not ef-
ciently occur owing to the assumed dependences of dust
growth timescales on gas density in VDA As a result of
this the nal Mdust and thus D can become signicantly
smaller in VDA
However the observed low log D  4 can be bet-
ter reproduced in the models only if Mh is very low
3  109M The observed very low log D  45
can not be reproduced by the present models even for
very low initial dark halo masses Mh  3  109M It
would be intriguing that dwarfs with a wider range of AO
72  AO  8 show such a very low D in observations
It would be unreasonable for the present study to explain
the observed very low D by lowering Mh to much less than
109M We thus conclude that the observed very low D
could be due to some physical eects that are not included
in the present study The cold gaseous components of low-
mass forming galaxies can be photo-evaporated by ultra-
violet background radiation in a high-z reionized universe
so that star-formation and thus chemical and dust enrich-
ment processes can be severely suppressed eg Susa 
Umemura 2004 This radiative feedback eect is not in-
cluded in the present study and thus could be a possible
reason for the observed very low D
Figure 11 shows that the z-evolution of dust-to-stellar-
mass ratios MdustM for 0  z  04 is rather at for
the high mass model with Mh  1012M The observa-
tional results by D11 show that there is a factor of  5 dif-
ference in MdustM between z  0 and 04 The models
with moderate and strong SNF show systematically larger
MdustM and thus the results are inconsistent with the
observed z-evolution The models with shorter dust de-
struction timescales d  1 and 15 can show a certain
degree of MdustM decrease the models are still unable
to reproduce the observed dramatic decrease The sys-
tematically higher MdustM can be seen in the low mass
It should be stressed here that the total dust mass of a
galaxy in the present study might not correspond to the
observed total dust mass because Mdust of a simulated
disk includes both disk and halo dust whereas the ob-
served total dust of a galaxy would not include halo dust
of the galaxy We therefore investigated the z-evolution
of MdustdM in the two mass models for a possibly
fairer comparison
It is clear in Figure11 that the sim-
ulated MdustdM does not show the observed level of
dramatic decrease from z  04 to 0 Since the low-
mass simulated disk has a larger fraction of halo dust ie
smaller MdustdMdust its MdustdM can be systemati-
cally lower than the observed value
The reason of this failure of the present models to re-
produce the observed dust evolution can be understood as
follows The total dust masses of galaxies can decrease
mainly through gas consumption due to star formation
within the galaxies in the present models Gas consump-
tion by star formation between z  0 and 04 is not high
so that dust mass can not decrease so signicantly Fur-
thermore the total stellar mass can only slowly increase
between z  0 and 04 through the formation of new stars
Therefore the present models fail to reproduce the ob-
served factor of  5 decrease of Mdust and MdustM We
thus conclude that the present models can not reproduce
the observed dramatic evolution of dust masses and dust-
to-stellar-mass ratios between z  0 and 04
33 Dust scaling relations at dierent z
It is useful for the present study to provide some pre-
dictions on the dust-scaling relations given that recent
observational studies have started to reveal a number of
dust scaling relations of galaxies eg Cortese et al 2012
Four dust and H2 scaling relations are derived for 18 mod-
els with VDA and the results are described in Figure
12-15 Figure 12 shows that a clear positive correlation
between M total stellar mass and Mdust ie larger
Mdust for larger M is already established at z  2 in the
simulated galaxies The simulated correlation can be t
roughly to Mdust  M 11
and does not appear to change
signicantly between z  2 and z  0 The fact that the
M  Mdust relation is less clear at z  5 suggests that
the correlation can be established during the early forma-
tion of galactic disks z  1  2 The correlation does
not show a large dispersion at a given M in the present
simulations
As shown in Figure 13 the simulated galaxies with
larger Mdust have larger MH2 at z  0 1 and 2 though
the positive correlation can not be clearly seen at z  5
The simulated Mdust  MH2 is closer to the observed one
by Corberi et al C12 at z  2 and starts to deviate from
the observed one for galaxies with lower Mdust  108M
at z  1 The dierences in MH2 between the observed and
simulated correlations become very clear for galaxies with
lower dust masses at z  0 The simulated lower MH2
results from the fact that low-mass and low-metallicity
galaxies can experience both the steady consumption of
MH2 and much less ecient H2 production owing to low
metallicitydust contents and low gas densities at later
z This inconsistency between the observed and simulated
Mdust  MH2 correlations for low Mdust implies that some
physical eects missing in the present study would need to
be included in our future work
Figure 14 shows that the simulated galaxies with larger
M show larger fH2 at z  0 1 and 2 though such a clear
positive correlation can not be seen at z  5 As shown in
Figure 12 galaxies with larger M can have larger Mdust
so that the formation of H2 gas can be more ecient in
the galaxies Therefore it is reasonable that galaxies with
larger M have larger fH2 It seems that i the dispersion
in fH2 for a given M becomes smaller at lower z in the
present simulations and ii fH2 for a given M is higher
at higher z These results will be able to be compared
with future ALMA observations of total H2 gas mass in
galaxies at dierent z
As shown in Figure 15 the simulated galaxies have a
positive correlation between fH2 and Mdust at z  0 1
and 2 though the slope of the Mdust  fH2 correlation ap-
pears to be slightly dierent at dierent z The simulated
almost linear ie steep correlation implies that low-mass
galaxies with low Mdust can form stars much less produc-
tively owing to very low H2 masses The predicted tight
Mdust  fH2 correlation at z  0 and lower z can be
tested against ongoing and future observations for a wide
range of Mdust
34 Radial gradients of D and dust depletion levels
Figure 16 shows that the simulated disk galaxy at z 
14 in the MW model with VDA has a negative radial
gradient of D ie larger D in smaller R though the dis-
persion of D at a given R is quite large at this epoch The
main reason for this negative radial gradient is that the
disk can have rather small D in the outer region where
chemical enrichment has not yet well proceeded at z  14
when the disk is still forming via dissipative merging It
should be stressed here that although dierent local re-
gions marked by small red dots show quite dierent D
SFe corresponding to dust-depletion level and SH
corresponding to gas-phase metallicity that is not inu-
enced by dust-depletion both D and SH show negative
radial gradients The derived negative D and AO gradi-
ents in the present models which show large fdust varia-
tion are consistent with the recent observations for M31
eg Draine et al 2014
The radial gradient of D later becomes shallower at
z  0 owing to chemical and dust enrichment processes
in the outer part of the gas disk Gas-phase chemical
abundances FeH and SH in the disk show slightly
negative radial gradients and their dispersions are quite
large at z  14 The gradients become almost at with
smaller dispersions in the gas disk at z  0 Thus the
radial gradients of D and gas-phase chemical abundances
evolve signicantly with z for the MW model with VDA
In the present dust models gas-phase SFe can be used
as a measurement of dust depletion for each gas particle
because dust depletion is not included for S whereas it is
properly included for Fe The radial gradient of SFe at
z  14 is negative ie larger in smaller R and steeper
with increasingly larger dispersions at larger R in this
model The derived dispersion in SFe means that dust
depletion levels can be quite dierent between dierent in-
dividual local gaseous regions in a forming galaxy The ra-
dial gradient of SFe at z  0 is atter with rather small
dispersions at dierent R which suggests that the spatial
variations of dust depletion levels can be more clearly seen
in the high-z galaxies These derived spatial and tempo-
ral variations of dust depletion levels have some impor-
tant implications on observational and theoretical studies
of galaxy formation which are later discussed
As shown in Figure 17 the radial gradients of D at
z  0 can be quite dierent in galaxies with dierent Mh
 and h for a given set of dust parameters Although all
of the models in Figure 17 show the negative radial gradi-
ents of D the gradients are less clear for low-mass models
with Mh  1010M The slopes of the radial D gradients
are signicantly shallower than 004 dex kpc1 that is
observed for the metallicity gradient of the Galaxy eg
Andrievsky et al 2004 The negative radial gradients of
D less steeper than gas-phase metallicity gradients can be
tested against ongoing observations
Figure 18 shows that the dust-to-metal ratios fdust are
quite dierent between dierent individual gaseous regions
of a single galaxy at z  0 14 and 18 and fdust can be
quite dierent for a given D The mean fdust evolves with
z such that it can become larger ie more strongly dust-
depleted at lower z The derived temporal and spatial
variations of fdust strongly suggest that a xed dust-to-
metal ratios should not be adopted in theoretical works
on the SEDs of galaxies and the formation and evolution
of cold H2 gas The dispersion of fH2 at a given D can
be clearly seen at the three z in this model which demon-
strates that larger D does not necessarily mean higher ef-
ciencies of H2 formation in galaxies
The main physical reason for large fdust variation is that
dierent local regions experience dierent chemical evolu-
tion histories and dust accretion and destruction processes
caused by dierent physical conditions of ISM and star for-
mation histories Therefore the derived fdust variation is
not due to the adopted models eg star formation depen-
dent on H2 densities in the present simulations Such a
large temporal variation is already found in previous one
zone models eg Figure 6 in Inoue 2003 and Figure 7
in Calura et al 2008
Recent observational studies on dust-to-metal ratios in
damped Lyman- absorbers DLAs at higher z  12
have revealed a large a factor of  10 variation of fdust in
the ISM of the DLAs eg De Cia et al 2013 Further-
more D at a given AO in the observed D  AO relation
shows rather large dispersion G11 which suggests that
dust-to-metal-ratio is not constant among dierent galax-
ies These observations are consistent with the large fdust
variation derived in the present study The possible tem-
poral and spatial fdust variations would have some implica-
tions on some recent observational works eg Eales et al
2012 which have tried to estimate the total amount of
cold gas in galaxies by using the continuum dust emission
and Grootes et al 2013 which have revealed correla-
tions between the stellar mass surface densities and the
optical depth due to dust in galaxies
35 Formation of extended dusty gaseous halos
The simulated negative radial gradient of D in Figure 16
implies that the projected radial density prole of dust in
a galaxy can have a steep gradient Figure 19 shows that
the simulated disk galaxies can have gaseous halos R  30
kpc extended well beyond the disk sizes  20 kpc The
radial prole of the cumulative dust mass M  R nor-
malized by the total mass within 100kpc M R  100kpc
clearly demonstrate that a larger fraction of dust in the
outer R  30 halo of the simulated disk galaxies The
extended dusty gaseous halos can be formed in most of the
present models Since the present chemodynamical models
do not include the dust destruction by hot gaseous plasma
in galaxy halos they might have overestimated the total
amount of halo dust
The simulated slope in the mass proles of dust in the
outer halo R  30 kpc are too steep to be consistent
with the observed one   R08 by Menard et al 2010
M10 It is currently unclear why the observed slope is
signicantly shallower than the mass distributions of gas
and dark matter halos in galaxies Possibly we would need
to incorporate an additional physical process for dust evo-
lution eg radiation pressure on dust grains into chemo-
dynamical simulations in order to reproduce the observed
shallower prole of dust
During the hierarchical build-up of the disk galaxies
their cold gas containing dust can be expelled from the
galaxies owing to the energetic SNF The expelled dust
can not be return back to the host galaxies quickly so that
they can be observed as being in the halo regions This
blown-o eect of SNe is the key physical process for the
formation of dusty gaseous halos in galaxies As shown in
Figure 11 the mass fractions of halo dust MdusthMdust
can be larger in less massive galaxies This is mainly be-
cause the less massive galaxies are more prone to the en-
ergetic SNF during their formation It is observationally
unclear however whether less massive disk galaxies have
larger fractions of dust in their halos
4 discussion
41 Origin of the observed AO  D relation
Recent observations have found the following three char-
acteristics of the metallicity-dust relation in galaxies eg
G11 First more metal-rich galaxies with larger AO can
show larger D Second the dispersion in D at a given AO
is much larger than the possible observational error in the
estimation of D Third the metallicity-dust relation ap-
pears to be dierent for AO  8 and AO  8 The linear
AO  D correlation for AO  8 appears to be steeper than
that for AO  8 The present study has shown that more
massive galaxies can show both larger AO and larger D
which is qualitatively consistent with the observed rela-
tion Furthermore the simulated relation is steeper and
thus more consistent with the observed one if the strong
SNF model is adopted The main physical reason for the
larger D in more massive galaxies is that a larger fraction
of dust and metals can be retained in the galaxies ie re-
moval of dust and metals through energetic stellar winds
is not so eective in more massive galaxies
Although the present study has demonstrated that
SNF is a key physical process for the formation of the
metallicity-dust relation the observed large scatter for a
given AO can not be well reproduced in the present study
One possible reason for this is that the present simulations
do not include dust removal through radiation pressure of
stars on dust grains If only dust not gas-phase metals
can be selectively removed by this radiation process then
D can be even lower for a given AO This removal of dust
through dust winds caused by stellar radiation pressure
might depend on a number of physical parameters of dust
and galaxies such as size distributions of dust grains and
age distributions of stars in galaxies Therefore the dust
removal eciency might be dierent between galaxies with
a similar AO so that galaxies with a similar AO can show
a larger dispersion in D In order to discuss whether the
selective dust removal through stellar radiation is possi-
ble we will include the dust removal process in our future
more sophisticated simulations
The observed apparently steeper slope for AO  8 can
not be clearly seen in the present study The observed
presence of dwarfs with AO  8 and log D  45 at
z  0 can not be well reproduced by the present study ei-
ther The observed very low D in dwarfs implies that dust
is either destroyed or removed more eciently than the
present simulations predict Some of the observed dwarfs
at z  0 show a very low log D  5 which is very hard
to be explained by the present study This inconsistency
between observations and simulations clearly suggests that
some physical eects related to dust formation and evolu-
tion missing in the present simulations need to be included
in our future simulations
42 Temporal and spatial variations of
dust-to-metal-ratios in galaxies
The present study has shown that dust-to-metal ratios
fdust of galaxies evolve with z and they can be quite dif-
ferent between dierent local gaseous regions in an individ-
ual galaxy at a given z This result provides the following
implications on the observational and theoretical deriva-
tion of galactic SEDs and the construction of H2 forma-
tion models in numerical studies of galaxy formation and
evolution Numerical simulations of galaxy formation and
evolution tried to predict the SEDs of dusty galaxies based
on the age and metallicity distributions of stars and the
spatial distributions of gas and stars in simulated galaxies
eg Bekki et al 1999 Bekki  Shioya 2000 2001 Jon-
sson 2006 A basic assumption in these previous works
is that fdust is xed at a certain value eg an observed
value for the Galaxy for all gas particles at a given time
step The present results suggest that such an assumption
of constant fdust is not reasonable though it is unclear how
much the previous derivation of galactic SEDs can change
if fdust variation is correctly included in their simulations
Future numerical simulations of dusty galaxies will need
to include spatial and temporal variations of fdust in order
to predict the SEDs more precisely
Numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolu-
tion and theoretical models of star formation have just
recently started to include H2 formation on dust grains
in ISM eg Pelupessy et al 2006 Krumholz McKee
 Tumlinson 2009 Christenson et al 2012 Although
the formation of H2 on dust grains depend on dust abun-
dances compositions and size-distributions the forma-
tion eciencies of H2 on dust grains in these works is
assumed to be a function of metallicity ie dust abun-
dances is simply proportional to metallicity The present
results mean that the assumed constant fdust is clearly
an over-simplication for the H2 formation processes and
thus that the previous simulations might have over- or
under-estimated the total H2 masses of galaxies Future
numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution
with H2 formation will need to include the time evolution
of fdust in order to predict H2 contents of galaxies more
precisely
43 Consistency with observations
Although the present study has shown only the prelim-
inary results of the simulations it would be meaningful
for the study to discuss the consistency between the sim-
ulated dust properties of galaxies and the corresponding
observational ones If the observed properties are not re-
produced by the present models then additional physical
eects on dust grains that are not included in the models
should be considered in future more sophisticated models
Table 5 lists up 13 physical properties of galaxies for which
observations and simulations are compared with
Only three observations among thirteen can be repro-
duced reasonably well by the present model which means
either that some key physical processes related to dust for-
mation and evolution are not incorporated properly in the
model or that the resolution of numerical simulations or
adopted idealized initial conditions can be responsible for
the less successful reproduction Clearly the inuences of
stellar radiation on dust grains eg Ferrara et al 1991
Bekki  Tsujimoto 2014 is completely ignored though it
can remove the dust from gas disks of galaxies This igno-
rance might lead us to overestimate the dust production
rate within galaxies Furthermore the dust-gas interac-
tion which is demonstrated to be important in galactic
dynamics for large dust mass fractions Theis  Orlova
2004 is also ignored in the present study We will need
to include these missing ingredients in our future simu-
lations to address the latest observations of galactic dust
evolution in detail
Lastly we briey discuss the present dust-regulated star
formation model by comparing the observed correlations
of sSFRs with z and M Elbaz et al 2011 E11 with the
corresponding simulation results Figure 20 shows that
the sSFRs are systematically lower than those for galaxies
on the main sequence at lower z  2 Furthermore
sSFRs of the two simulated disk galaxies at z  0 seem
to be lower for their large M These results imply that
the present dust-regulated SF model or H2-dependent SF
model might underestimate the star formation eciency
in ISM of galaxies We need to discuss this point in a
separate paper
5 conclusions
We have investigated the z-evolution of dust and gas
contents in galaxies and its dependences on initial con-
ditions of galaxy formation models based on a CDM
cosmology by using our chemodynamical simulations with
dust growth and destruction This is the very rst applica-
tion of our new chemodynamical simulation code with dust
evolution to a numerical study of hierarchical galaxy for-
mation We therefore needed to derive a reasonable range
of dust parameters that explain observations by running a
large number of models based on somewhat idealized ini-
tial conditions The derived dust parameters will be used
for future more sophisticated zoom-in galaxy formation
simulations
In this preliminary investigation we have focused
particularly on the z-evolution of total dust and H2
masses Mdust and MH2 respectively dust-to-gas-ratios
D molecular hydrogen fraction fH2  dust deple-
tion levels SFe and fdust gas-phase abundances
AO 12logOH and radial gradients of D and gas-
phase abundances We have also investigated correlations
and scaling-relations between these properties and the
dependences of dust and H2 properties on initial mass
densities spin parameters and masses of galaxies The
present preliminary results are as follows
1 The dust growth and destruction timescales a and
d respectively need to be carefully modeled so that both
the present dust and H2 properties of luminous galaxies
can be reproduced reasonably well For example a as
long as  01 Gyr is required for the models with CDA to
explain the observed dust and H2 properties of the Galaxy
Without dust growth and destruction the observed D and
fH2 can not be well reproduced by the present simulations
These results imply that dust evolution needs to be prop-
erly included in numerical simulations of galaxy formation
for predicting not only dust properties of the present galax-
ies but also the z-evolution of H2 contents in galaxies
2 Both D and qPAH can grow rapidly during the early
dissipative formation of galactic disks through merging of
gas-rich subgalactic clumps at z  2  3 The z-evolution
of D and qPAH in disk galaxies depends strongly on mass
densities of forming galaxies in such a way that D and
qPAH evolution can start increasing earlier and the com-
mencement of the rapid qPAH increase is slightly later than
that of the rapid D increase in galaxies The time evolu-
tion of D and qPAH does not depend so strongly on spin
parameters  for a given initial mass
3 Disk galaxies with lower initial masses can lose a
larger amount of dust through SN winds so that their -
nal D and AO can be smaller The present variable dust
growth model VDA can better reproduce the observed
AO  D relation than the xed dust growth model CDA
However the observed relation shows a signicantly larger
dispersion of D at a given AO than the simulated one The
present simulations do not reproduce the observed dwarfs
with low AO  8 and very low log D  45 at z  0
This failure of the present models to reproduce such a low
D at z  0 could be related to the fact that the present
models do not include dust removal through dust wind due
to radiation pressure of stars
4 The simulated disk galaxies show little evolution
of Mdust Mdustd and MdustM MdustdM between
z  0 and 04 The observed dramatic evolution a factor
of  5 dierences between z  0 and 04 of these dust
properties derived by D11 is thus inconsistent with the
present results The total amount of ISM with dust can
be decreased by gas consumption due to star formation in
the simulated disk galaxies but the rate of gasdust con-
sumption can not be rapid enough to explain the observed
z-evolution of dust properties These imply that some key
physics related to dust evolution is missing in the present
chemodynamical simulations
5 Disk galaxies at z  0 show negative radial gradients
of D larger in smaller radii from galaxy centers for most
models and the gradients evolve with z in luminous disk
galaxies ie steeper at higher z Both D and gas-phase
FeH are signicantly dierent between dierent local re-
gions in an individual galaxy owing to dierent chemical
evolution and SF histories in these regions Dwarfs or
low-mass disk galaxies can have dusty gaseous halo that
is formed through ejection of dust due to supernova winds
6 Dust depletion levels estimated from gas-phase
SFe and fdust are spatially dierent between individual
local gaseous regions of a single galaxy and between dier-
ent galaxies at a given z The dust depletion levels evolve
with z owing to chemical and dust evolution of galaxies
These results imply that dust-to-metal-ratios should not
be xed in constructing SEDs of galaxies and predicting
H2 evolution of galaxies
7 The simulated disk galaxies can have very ex-
tended dusty gaseous halos with the mass fractions
MdusthMdust as large as or larger than 05 This
could be overestimation because dust destruction by hot
gaseous halo is not included in the present simulations
During the formation of disk galaxies the cold gas with
dust can be blown o by energetic SNF Since less massive
galaxies are more prone to such SNF the mass fractions of
halo dust are higher The projected radial density proles
of the dusty halos are rather steep and thus inconsistent
with the observed ones   R08
8 The simulated MdustMH2 scaling relation is steeper
than the observe one for low-mass galaxies with lower
Mdust The present simulations predict that galaxies with
larger M have larger Mdust Mdust  M and fH2
fH2  M  These scaling relations can be seen already
at z  2 though they are less clear at z  5 There is a
strong correlation between fH2 and Mdust fH2  Mdust
in simulated galaxies at z  0
9 The nal D and fH2 in disk galaxies at z  0 are
larger in time-varying initial mass functions IMFs than
in xed ones mainly because chemical evolution can pro-
ceed more rapidly in the time-varying IMFs Furthermore
gas consumption rates ie SFRs and nal total stellar
masses are lower and smaller respectively in the mod-
els with the time-varying IMFs Since the present study
did not investigate the models with time-varying IMFs in
detail our future works need to conrm this importance
of IMFs in the z-evolution of dust and H2 properties of
galaxies
10 Given a number of inconsistencies between the ob-
served and simulated dust properties of galaxies in the
present study we will need to improve the dust models and
the way to incorporate the dust physics into the chemo-
dynamical models in our future works In particular the
models for dust accretion and destruction would need to
be more sophisticated by including the time evolution of
dust sizes and the locally dierent destruction processes of
dust by SNe The inuences of stellar radiation on dust
grains and dust-gas interaction in ISM are among the new
ingredients that should be also included in our future more
sophisticated numerical simulations of galaxy formation

Table 5
A brief summary for the comparison between the present numerical simulations and the latest observational
results on dust and H2 properties of galaxies In the consistency column cid13  and  mean consistent with
observations partly consistent ie not all of the observations are reproduced and inconsistent
respectively If no observations have been reported then   is given in the consistency column Observational
papers eg C12 are given in the Reference column Clearly a number of observations are not well
reproduced by the present models which implies that more sophisticated numerical simulations with better
dust models will need to be carried out in our future studies

without dust destruction and without dust growth and with dust destruction W-dest are represented by blue solid red dotted and green

results from Nakanishi et al 2003 2006 Zubko et al 2004 and Draine  Li 2007 are adopted The larger error bar in fH2 is plotted
only for the purpose of showing the uncertainly in the CO-to-H2 conversion factor for the estimation of MH2 thus fH2  of the MW

dierent a and d in the low-resolution MW model with Mh  1012M  006 CDA and weak SNF Dierent color and line-types are
used for dierent models so that the dierence in the evolution of fH2 and Mdust can be clearly see n The nal values of fH2 and MH2 at
z  0 are indicated by dierent marks for dierent models In the left two panels the models with a  d  025 Gyr blue solid open
triangle andwith a  d  05 Gyr cyan long-dashed lled square are regarded as unrealistic owing to the later decrease of D and fH2 
In the right two panels the models with shorter a  0025 Gyr and 001 Gy r do not show reasonable behaviors in the evolution of D and
fH2 unless d is long enough These results imply that careful choice of dust growth and destruction parameters is required for reproducing
dust and H2 properties of galaxies

meshes so that dust can be estimated for each mesh by using the dust properties of all gas particles in each mesh The Gaussian smoothing
with the smoothing length of 175 kpc is applied for deriving a smoother 2D dust distribution for this model

low two panels The vertical dotted lines show the age boundary between the three components of the simulated disk galaxy Only one every
20 particles for the left and one every 100 particles for the right are shown so that the le size of this gure can be kept small enough less

specic SFR SFRM bottom for the model The two vertical dashed lines indicate the ages of the universe at the two z The slow steady
increase of Mdust and D at z  35 is due to the growth of pre-galactic dust whereas the rapid increase at z  35 is caused by chemical
enrichment due to very active star formation during early disk formation via dissipative merging of subgalactic clumps

the error bars indicate the dispersions of these four physical quanties The small red dots represent D and gas-phase chemical abundances
for selected gas particles corresponding to individual local gaseous regions The dust depletion level can be measured from SFe in the
present study where only S is assumed to be unable to be locked up into dust grains Accordingly higher SFe means a higher level of dust
depletion in this gure
