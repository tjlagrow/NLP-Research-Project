ABSTRACT
We cross match the NVSS and FIRST surveys with three large photometric cat-
alogues of luminous red galaxies LRGs to dene radio-loud samples These have
median redshifts 035 055 and 068 and by matching rest-frame optical and radio
properties we construct uniform samples across the three surveys This paper is con-
cerned with the clustering properties of these samples derived from the angular cor-
relation function The primary aim is to characterise any evolution in the clustering
amplitude of radio galaxies bellow z  068
We nd no evidence for evolution in the large-scale  1  50 h1 Mpc clustering
amplitude Our radio galaxy autocorrelations are consistent with previous ndings
indicating little-to-no evolution in the redshift range 068 to 0  6 Gyr of time We
also cross correlate radio galaxies with the parent LRG samples to increase the preci-
sion of our results and again nd no evidence for evolution in comoving coordinates
Our results are inconsistent with a long-lived model for the clustering evolution that
assumes radio sources randomly sample the LRG population A model where the halo
mass is constant with redshift is consistent with the data This is similar to QSOs
that have clustering amplitudes consistent with a single halo mass at all redshifts
Given that the brightest radio sources show stronger evolution in space density com-
pared to fainter radio sources we restrict our samples to include only objects with
L  1026 WHz and repeat the analysis Again we nd no evidence for evolution in
the comoving correlation amplitude These radio sources appear to inhabit the same
mass halos as fainter radio galaxies  9  1013h1 M These halos are twice as
massive as those of the general LRG population  4  1013h1 M and  30 times
as massive as optical AGNQSOs  3  1012h1 M

INTRODUCTION
Radio galaxies have long been used to study large scale
structure as they are highly biased indicators of the mass
distribution and are naturally found in the high redshift
z  1 Universe Understanding the observed bias of ra-
dio galaxies requires relating their clustering to that of their
host populations Furthermore any dierential evolution in
their clustering with respect to their hosts gives insight into
the nature of radio galaxies and the mechanisms that trigger
The typical host galaxy of a radio source depends
strongly on its luminosity At lower radio luminosities L 
1023 WHz the population is almost exclusively made up
of starforming galaxies with related diuse radio emis-
sion above L  1023 WHz almost all radio sources are
 stephennedurhamacuk
associated with active galactic nuclei AGN The hosts
of the brightest radio galaxies have strong emission lines
eg Hine  Longair 1979 McCarthy 1993 while lower-
luminosity radio AGN are hosted by massive ellipticals
with little-to-no optical line emission This transition im-
plies a cuto luminosity between objects with and with-
out emission lines that Johnston et al 2008 found to
be around  1026 WHz This luminosity is close to the
traditional cuto between morphologically classied FRI
and FRII objects Fanaro  Riley 1974 Furthermore
while the bright end of the radio luminosity function
evolves strongly towards higher space densities at high z
Longair 1966 Dunlop  Peacock 1990 fainter radio AGN
L  1026 WHz show much less evidence for evolution
Clewley  Jarvis 2004 Sadler et al 2007 This evolution
in space density is roughly matched by the typical hosts of
radio AGN Massive elliptical galaxies luminous red galax-
ies LRGs that host lower luminosity radio AGN show lit-
Fine et al
tle evolution in number density for z  1 Bell et al 2004
Wake et al 2006 Brown et al 2007 Higher luminosity ra-
dio sources are more associated with opticalXray AGN
McCarthy 1993 that show strong evolution out to z  25
Schmidt 1968 Croom et al 2009
Radio sources are strongly biased tracers of the un-
derlying mass distribution of the Universe Yates et al
1989 Peacock  Nicholson 1991 Blake  Wall
Magliocchetti et al 2004 Brand et al 2005 Since the ad-
vent of deep all sky surveys eg FIRST NVSS SUMSS
WENSS there have been major leaps in the ability to de-
scribe the environments of radio galaxies These milli-Jansky
surveys sample the luminosity range  1023 to 1026 WHz
at moderate redshifts where radio sources are found almost
exclusively in LRGs LRGs are known to be a strongly bi-
ased tracer of the matter density and their bias increases
with the massluminosity of the LRG
Radio sources tend to be found in the most massive el-
liptical galaxies and more massive galaxies are more likely
to host them Best et al 2005 Mauch  Sadler 2007 Re-
cent studies have compared the clustering of radio galaxies
to that of radio-quiet galaxies that have been matched in
their optical properties to the radio sample Most nd that
radio galaxies are signicantly more clustered than optically
identical samples of quiescent galaxies Wake et al 2008
Mandelbaum et al 2009 Donoso et al 2009 although see
Hickox et al 2009 for a counter example we will discuss
later The indication is that the environment of a galaxy
contributes to the probability of it hosting a radio source
In this paper we are primarily concerned with how the
clustering of radio sources evolves for z  07 In this redshift
interval the clustering amplitude of LRGs is approximately
constant Wake et al 2008 Sawangwit et al 2009 How-
ever the clustering amplitude of quasars evolves such that
when models of gravitational collapse are assumed the im-
plied dark halo mass for quasars is approximately constant
Croom et al 2005 Ross et al 2009 We will evaluate the
clustering amplitude of radio LRGs in a series of samples
from z  068 to 035 to investigate any evolution in their
clustering This will be done both for a sample of medium
luminosity L  10247 WHz radio galaxies and a high
luminosity subsample L  1026 WHz
In section 2 we introduce the data that will be used
in this work section 3 describes the algorithm we develop
for identifying radio LRGs section 4 describes the corre-
lation analysis to be used section 5 compares the cluster-
ing of radio-loud and quiet LRGs section 6 then looks at
the evolution of radio LRGs and in section 7 we investigate
the evolution of the very brightest radio LRGs Through-
out this paper we assume a at m   03 07
H0  70 km s1 Mpc1 cosmology All radio ux densities
and luminosities are at 14 GHz unless otherwise stated and
when estimating radio luminosities throughout this paper
k-corrections have been performed assuming a continuum
shape of S   07
The LRG samples used in this paper are originally de-
ned from three spectroscopic surveys SDSS 2SLAQ and
AA Eisenstein et al 2001 Cannon et al 2006 Ross et al
2008 The LRG selection was rened by Sawangwit et al
2009 to create photometric samples from the SDSS DR5
York et al 2000 Adelman-McCarthy et al 2007 and to
cut down on stellar contamination We use LRG samples
dened identically but drawn from the more recent DR7
Abazajian et al 2009
To identify radio-loud LRGs in our sample we com-
pare our LRG catalogues with radio source catalogues from
the NVSS Condon et al 1998 and FIRST Becker et al
2000 surveys Both surveys are carried out at 14 GHz and
the high angular resolution 5 arcsec and faint ux limit
1 015 mJy of the FIRST survey combined with the
large-scale sensitivity of the NVSS make them complemen-
tary tools for identifying radio LRGs The FIRST survey
covers much of the same sky area as the SDSS north Galac-
tic cap In the overlap region there are 110104 652401 and
799519 objects in the SDSS 2SLAQ and AA LRG sam-
ples respectively See Sawangwit et al 2009 for the redshift
distributions expected contamination and autocorrelation
clustering properties of the LRG samples
3 RADIO CROSS MATCHING
Complex radio source morphology due to extended struc-
tures compounded by size-dependent response eects due
to the use of interferometers makes radio source matching
more involved than simply matching sky positions The most
accurate and precise method for cross-matching has always
been manual inspection eg Sadler et al 2007 However
the size of our LRG samples forces us to dene an auto-
mated cross-matching procedure that does not require visual
inspection of all of the potential radio matches in the sam-
ple Automated radio-matching routines have been devel-
oped before eg Best et al 2005 Kimball  Ivezic 2008
and even samples dened by manual inspection use some au-
tomated procedures to dene a sample of potential matches
that are then visually inspected
31 Our cross-matching procedure
Sadler et al 2007 dene two samples of radio LRGs from
the 2SLAQ spectroscopic sample One is based on manual
inspection and the other based on automatic cross matching
to the FIRST survey We modied their selection criteria to
dene a radio matching procedure and use their manually
inspected sample to test our results We match the LRG and
FIRST catalogues within a 30 arcsec radius and the LRG
and NVSS catalogues within a 180 arcsec radius retaining
all radio matches within the given radius around an LRG
In this initial cross matching we do not apply any radio
ux limits these are applied below Following Sadler et al
2007 we use the FIRST matches as our primary tool for
identifying radio galaxies We accept matches that meet one
of three criteria
i A FIRST match is within 3 arcsec of the LRG position
ii A FIRST match is within 10 arcsec of the LRG position
and the major axis of the source is orientated within 25 of
the angle to the LRG position
iii Given more than one radio match the ux-weighted
mean of the FIRST positions or any subset thereof is
within 6 arcsec of the LRG position
For any sources
that had NVSS matches within
180 arcsec but not FIRST matches we applied a similar set
of criteria based on Best et al 2005 to the NVSS sources
to dene potential radio galaxies These are
i An NVSS match is within 10 arcsec of the LRG position
ii A galaxy matched to two radio components that is
 10 arcsec from the ux weighted radio centroid and the
radio-galaxy-radio angle is  150
iii Given more than two radio matches the ux-weighted
mean of the NVSS positions is within 10 arcsec of the LRG
position
We apply this procedure to the 2SLAQ spectroscopic
catalogue and nd 428 objects satisfy our selection criteria
Of these 57 objects do not appear in the Sadler catalogue
while 20 objects from the Sadler catalogue are not found
This indicates that we are  5  incomplete with respect to
the Sadler catalogue the majority of sources missed by our
selection criteria have complex structures in their FIRST
images Of the 57 extra matches 29 can be explained as ob-
jects that had NVSS matches but no corresponding FIRST
sources These objects were rejected by Sadler et al to im-
prove the reliability of their catalogue We take an approach
more similar to Best et al 2005 including these sources
given the criteria above This indicates that our routine ap-
plied to the 2SLAQ spectroscopic LRG catalogue is  93 
reliable
We apply this radio cross-matching routine to the
SDSS 2SLAQ and AA photometric LRG samples and
obtain 9689 15236 and 8364 radio LRGs from the three
samples This corresponds to 88 23 and 10  of the par-
ent samples The considerably higher detection rate for the
SDSS sample is due to the lower redshift and higher absolute
optical magnitude of the SDSS LRGs
We perform a simple check of the reliability of our nal
radio samples by osetting the original LRG samples then
rerunning the cross-matching code on the oset catalogues
We oset the samples by 01 in declination twice the
180 arcsec maximum cross-matching radius used The cross-
matching code found 171138 516453 457499 matches
in the oset SDSS 2SLAQ and AA samples respectively
for the positive and negative osets This corresponds to
15-6  contamination in our nal catalogues similar to the
 7  value found when comparing to Sadler et al 2007
Many of the radio identications are based solely on
matching to FIRST source catalogues thanks to the angu-
lar resolution of the FIRST survey However the FIRST
surveys smaller beam resolves out large-scale structure and
does not give accurate radio powers for these sources We
cross match our nal radio LRG catalogue with the NVSS
within a 180 arcsec radius We then identify which NVSS
matches are associated with the galaxy using the criteria
above We sum these NVSS components to give the radio
ux densities used throughout this paper The NVSS is es-
sentially complete above  28 mJy Condon et al 1998
and in our nal sample we apply a radio ux density cut
of 3 mJy
32 Redshift distributions
The radio-loud subsets of the three LRG samples may not
have the same redshift distribution as their parent sample In
Radio clustering evolution
Figure 1 The solid lines shows the redshift distributions of the
SDSS 2SLAQ and AA spectroscopic samples left to right
The dashed lines show the redshift distribution of those objects
identied as radio sources These are in general identical to the
parent distribution In the highest redshift AA sample there is a
dierence but there are only 17 objects dening this distribution
Fig 1 we plot the redshift distribution of the spectroscopic
LRG samples and those objects that we identify as radio
galaxies from our matching routine
For the SDSS and 2SLAQ samples it is clear that the
radio-detected subsamples have an identical redshift dis-
tribution to their parent samples The AA radio sample
shows indications of being at a higher redshift However
there are only 17 spectroscopic AA radio LRGs and hence
the distribution is highly uncertain For the rest of this paper
we will assume that the radio LRGs have the same redshift
distribution as their parent sample None the less if the in-
dication of Fig 1 is accurate that the radio LRGs have a
higher redshift than the parent sample this will eect our
results In particular a cross correlation between the radio
loud sample and the parent sample will be reduced if the
redshift distributions do not overlap so well
4 CORRELATION ANALYSIS
To study the clustering of the samples dened above we cal-
culate the 2-point angular correlation function to measure
the LRGLRG autocorrelations and the LRGradio cross
correlation The 2-point angular correlation function is de-
ned as the relative increase in pair counts at a given scale
over that of a random sample That is
w 
where DD gives the number of sample-sample pairs and DR
gives the sample-random pairs at separation  The expres-
sion is normalised by the number density of randoms N R
divided by the density of the sample N D In an autocor-
relation the data-data pairs come from the same sample in
a cross correlation they come from diering samples Other
estimators for w Hamilton 1993 Landy  Szalay 1993
give equivalent results for this analysis
We constructed our random catalogue from the DR7
masks published on the SDSS website The full DR7 area
was then cut down to the area covered by FIRST and popu-
lated with random sources with a density twenty times that
of the radio LRGs
Fine et al
41 Error estimation
Standard Poisson errors are notoriously inaccurate for cor-
relation functions due to the high level of covariance in the
data eg Sawangwit et al 2009 More often bootstrap or
eld-to-eld errors are employed as an independent measure
of the precision of the results We calculate eld-to-eld er-
rors by subdividing our sample into nine declination strips
that contain even numbers of objects in our random cat-
alogues We calculate the correlation function within each
eld and the error is estimated by the rms of the correlation
functions in each eld divided by three
5 CORRELATION FUNCTIONS
In Fig 2 we show the LRG-LRG and LRG-radio hereafter
LL and LR angular correlation functions for the three
samples we are studying In the top panels we show the raw
correlations In the bottom panels we show the ratio of our
measurements to the best double power-law t to the LL
correlation function taken from Sawangwit et al 2009
In all three samples we study it is apparent that the
LR correlation is stronger than the LL autocorrelation
indicating that radio galaxies are found preferentially in
richer environments than their parent LRG population The
LR cross correlation like LL exhibits a clear inection
at intermediate scales a few arcmin which is generally in-
terpreted as the crossover between the intra and inter-halo
scales Similar to previous authors we nd that the excess
clustering signal from the LR correlation is strongest in
the 1 halo regime Donoso et al 2009 interpret this as in-
dicating radio galaxies hold a particularly central position
within their dark matter halo At larger scales the dierence
between the LL and LR correlation functions is reduced
and becomes negligible above  20 arcmin in the AA sam-
ple As we discuss later this may be due to the radio sources
being brighter in this higher-redshift sample
To relate the measured angular correlation function
w to the 3D spatial correlation function r we follow
the standard approach outlined in Phillipps et al 1978
Given the clear inection in the correlation functions shown
in Fig 2 we assume the spatial correlation function can be
parametrised as a double power law and integrate equa-
tion 13 from Phillipps et al 1978 to give w In our
analysis we x the break scale in the correlation function to
1 h1 Mpc We t for the slopes of the two power laws and
the amplitude of the large-scale power law Table 1 gives the
parameters of ts to the observed data
The large scale slope of r in the LR data is essen-
tially identical in each sample as it is when compared to the
LL correlations The small scale power law is considerably
steeper in the radio correlations indicating that the local
environment of radio LRGs is more overdense compared to
the environment external to its own dark matter halo
51 Radio loud vs quiet LRG clustering
Radio galaxies are known to be found preferentially in the
most luminous host galaxies eg Mauch  Sadler 2007
The most luminous galaxies tend to also be found in the
highest density regions and following previous authors eg

Wake et al 2008 we test whether this covariance is respon-
sible for the increased LR correlation strength We con-
struct random samples of LRGs from our parent catalogues
that have the same r-band magnitude and r  i colour dis-
tributions as the radio LRG catalogues In Fig 2 we show
the cross correlation between this matched catalogue and
the full LRG sample We nd that they follow the LL lines
almost exactly indicating that the host massluminosity is
not the single factor that denes the probability that a LRG
is a radio source there must be an environmental eect as
Our results are in agreement with most previous authors
Wake et al 2008 Mandelbaum et al 2009 Donoso et al
2009 Hickox et al 2009 on the other hand nds that
the radio galaxies in his sample cluster with the same ampli-
tude as galaxies matched in terms of their optical properties
They note that the result is marginal but also point out that
their radio galaxies have considerably higher stellar mass to
radio power ratios than the other samples and suggest this
as a potential explanation for the discrepancy Certainly if
the clustering strength depends on the radio luminosity that
could potentially explain their result
52 Clustering strength vs radio luminosity
Prestage  Peacock 1988 found that less luminous FR1
objects tended to be in overdense regions while more lumi-
nous FR2s had a clustering environment similar to the over-
all population of radio-quiet galaxies However many au-
thors eg Peacock  Nicholson 1991 Magliocchetti et al
2004 have found no relationship between radio power and
large scale clustering strength Donoso et al 2009 found
variations in the correlation amplitude with radio power that
were more pronounced at smaller spatial scales At these
smaller scales they found that the correlation amplitude in-
creased with radio power up to  1025 WHz above which
the correlation amplitude attened and then began to fall
again above  10255 WHz
We divide our sample of radio LRGs into three bins
of roughly equal size by their ux density with cuts at
S14 GHz 5 and 20 mJyHz Fig 3 shows the LR cross
correlations for each of the ux density bins for the three
LRG samples
We do not nd the same behaviour in each LRG sam-

correlation of the sample matched to the radio samples in terms of optical luminosity and colour The top panels show the correlation
functions along with best t models to the LM solid and LR dashed data The models are double power laws in r mapped to
w with Limbers equation The bottom panels show the ratio of the LR and LM correlations to the best t LL model Errorbars
are omitted from the top plots for clarity
Figure 3 LR cross correlation functions for the SDSS 2SLAQ and AA samples left to right with the radio sample split into
three bins by radio ux density The bottom panels show the ratio of the correlation functions to the best t LL model Errorbars are
omitted from the top plots for clarity In the SDSS sample there is evidence for a positive correlation between radio ux density and the
correlation strength This is not so clear in the other two samples
ple In the SDSS sample there is a clear positive correlation
between radio luminosity and the angular correlation am-
plitude As with the dierence between the LL and LR
correlations the luminosity dependence is most pronounced
at small angular scales 2 arcmin In the 2SLAQ sam-
ple the lowest ux density bin is signicantly  3 lower
than the other two subsets that essentially lie on top of each
other However in the highest redshift AA sample we nd
no signicant dierence between the three ux bins
Our results are broadly consistent with those of
Donoso et al 2009 At the median redshift of our sam-
ples the ux density limits we have chosen 520 mJy corre-
spond to logL14 GHzWHz  243249 247253 and
250255 for the SDSS 2SLAQ and AA samples respec-
tively Hence our results are consistent with the small-scale
radio correlation function increasing for radio luminosities

autocorrelation function in each sample and show the results
in Fig 6 The lines in the gure show the best t power law
in r  xed to 18 mapped to w with Limbers equa-
tion Table 2 summarises the results of our power law tting
in this section
Brand et al 2005 measured the clustering strength
of low-luminosity radio galaxies at z  03 and found
r0  61  11 h1 Mpc assuming r  rr018 This
is signicantly  31  less than the value of r0  110 
12 h1 Mpc found by Peacock  Nicholson 1991 at z 
01 Brand et al 2005 explained some of the discrepancy
by assuming the clustering amplitude would increase accord-
ingly with linear theory from z  03 to 0 Wake et al 2008
derived an autocorrelation clustering strength extrapolated
from the cross correlation of r0  123  12 h1 Mpc for ra-
dio sources in the 2SLAQ sample
In Fig 7 we show the values
for r0 calculated
in this paper circles along with the values found by
Peacock  Nicholson 1991 triangle Brand et al 2005
square and Wake et al 2008 star A best t to these
points gives a gradient consistent with zero  05
The ux limits of the Peacock  Nicholson 1991 and
Wake et al 2008 samples are such that they sample  2
times fainter in terms of radio luminosity at their median
redshifts compared to our samples Hence these surveys are
sampling relatively bright objects where we do not nd clus-
tering strength correlating with radio power Fig 3 The
Brand et al 2005 sample on the other hand goes  65
times fainter This dierence may explain why their result
is lower than the other values

6 CLUSTERING STRENGTH OF RADIO
SOURCES AT Z  068
Given our three samples span z  068 to 035 23 Gyr of
cosmic time we are interested in any signs of evolution in
the clustering strength of radio LRGs To make a fair com-
parison we make our samples as equivalent as possible in
terms of their optical and radio selection Sawangwit et al
2009 showed that by applying magnitude limits of idev 
1932 and 2025 to the 2SLAQ and AA samples respec-
tively they could be made roughly equivalent to the SDSS
sample in terms of their optical luminosity distribution
and space density given that the LRG luminosity function
does not evolve strongly over this interval eg Wake et al
2008 They call these optical LRG samples with additional
magnitude cuts SDSS 2SLAQ and AA  In addition we
increase the radio ux limit of the SDSS and 2SLAQ sam-
ples to 138 and 49 mJy respectively in order to be equiva-
lent to a radio power of  102472 WHz at the median red-
shift of each sample This results in 3576 4755 5089 objects
in our radio matched samples we will call SDSSr 2SLAQr
and AAr
In Fig 4 we show the cross correlations between the
radio matched and optically matched samples along with a
best-t double power law in r mapped to w with Lim-
bers equation Again the break in the power law is assumed
to be at 1h1 Mpc when performing the t in addition to
which we x the slope of the large-scale power law to be
  18 to facilitate comparisons of the clustering ampli-

three samples in addition to points from Peacock  Nicholson

measurements are consistent with no evolution in the cluster-
ing amplitude with redshift up to z  068 The Brand et al
2005 point is signicantly oset from the rest potentially due
to their sample being dominated by fainter objects The lines give

ii We further include the long-lived model of Fry 1996
that assumes no change in the comoving number density
of galaxies and that clustering grows solely due to gravi-
tational eects The long lived model has been shown to
describe evolution in the LRGLRG correlation function
Sawangwit et al 2009 Fits to the radio cross and auto
correlation amplitudes are shown as dashed lines in Figs 5
and 7 Note that the long-lived model does not require that
radio sources themselves exist for cosmological timescales
Rather that the dark matter halos that host them evolve
passively under the inuence of gravity This model involves
little evolution and hence gives a better t to our data
iii We also t a model
in which dark halo mass is
held constant with redshift solid lines Figs 5 and 7 see
Sawangwit et al 2009 for our formalism for relating bias to
dark halo mass This type of model has been shown to t
the evolution of the quasar autocorrelation function over
0  z  25

It is clear from Fig 7 and the squares in Fig 5 that there
is little evidence for evolution in the clustering amplitude
of either the auto or cross correlation with redshift Fitting
r0  1  z to the measurements in Fig 7 excluding
the Brand et al 2005 point gives   020  030 The
same t for the cross correlation squares in Fig 5 gives
  023  021 In addition we t a series of physically
motivated models to our data
i In linear theory structures evolve as m  D2z where
Dz is the growth factor and m is the matter correlation
function Structures that grow according to this have a con-
stant bias b where b2  m In Fig 7 we t a constant
bias model to our data and plot the results as the dot-dashed
Fine et al
To relate our models for the radio auto correlation to
the cross correlation amplitudes in Fig 5 we assume the
LRG clustering follows the best-t long-lived model from
Sawangwit et al 2009 We then assume that the cross-
correlation of two samples 12 is related to the two au-
tocorrelations 11 and 22 by eg Wake et al 2008
12  1122
The long-lived and constant mass models t our data
acceptably P 2   10  with the exception of the long-
lived model t to the cross correlation results In this case
we nd 2  908 with P 2   2  11  indicating
that the long-lived model may not accurately describe radio
source clustering The dark halo masses derived for the radio
sources are 94 and 56  1013h1 M for the cross and auto
correlation respectively
The oset in the derived dark halo masses may be due
to equation 2 not holding in our data In this paper and
Sawangwit et al 2009 large-scale correlation amplitudes
have been calculated for the    LRG auto correlation
  r cross correlation and the r  r autocorrelation Cal-
culating the cross correlation amplitude from the autocorre-
lations and equation 2 gives r0  975075 1028056 and
1026058h1 Mpc for the SDSS 2SLAQ and AA samples
respectively These values are consistently lower than the
amplitudes measured from the cross correlation although
only by  1 to 2 Taking the three samples together the
oset is  3 The oset may be due to two causes First
the ts are not completely equivalent we t double power
laws over a larger range of  for the    and   r correla-
tions Second equation 2 assumes a linear bias model that
may not hold in this case

blue objects that may be missed by the optical selection

SOURCES AT Z  068
luminous radio sources
The SDSSr 2SLAQr and AAr samples are dominated
by objects below the  1026 WHz divide between brighter
FRI and FRII sources 1026 WHz is also roughly the divide
between radio AGN host galaxies that show no emission
lines and those that do Furthermore above  1026 WHz
radio sources show strong number density evolution more
similar to quasars The clustering strength of quasars evolves
weakly with redshift Croom et al 2005 Ross et al 2009
In this section we use our sample to test for evolution in the
clustering amplitude of bright radio LRGs
A radio luminosity of 1026 WHz corresponds to ux
limits of  266 95 and 57 mJy at z  035 055 and
068 respectively Cutting back our samples to these lim-
its leave 49 224 and 283 objects in what we will call the
SDSS26 2SLAQ26 and AA26 samples These are not
large enough to calculate an autocorrelation amplitude so
we calculate the two-point cross correlation with the corre-
sponding starred LRG catalogues Fig 8 shows the cross
correlations along with best t solutions to r  r0r18
propagated through Limbers formula In Fig 5 the circles
show r0 for these bright objects as a function of redshift
Note that while lower-luminosity radio AGN are typi-
cally found in LRGs with red stellar spectra the brightest
sources can be found in both broad and narrow emission-
line objects that have younger stellar populations eg
As with the less luminous sample we nd very little evidence
for evolution in the clustering amplitude of these brightest
radio sources Fitting the cross correlation points circles
Fig 5 for r0  1  z gives   038  052
We also compare our results for the clustering of the
brightest radio sources with that of quasars To do this we
assume all quasars cluster such that their derived dark halo
mass is 3  1012 M at all redshifts Croom et al 2005
Ross et al 2009 and work backwards to derive the clus-
tering strength as a function of redshift We then convert
this to a cross-correlation clustering strength making the
assumptions discussed above We plot the derived value for
the cross-correlation amplitude in Fig 5 as the dot-dashed
While our derivation is approximate it suggests that
the clustering amplitude of bright radio sources may
evolve slowly with redshift and in an almost luminosity-
independent manner similar to the results found for
quasars There is also strong evidence that the objects in our
sample cluster considerably more strongly than quasars as
previously noted for fainter radio sources The implication
is that these bright radio sources must inhabit considerably
denser regions of space and correspondingly more massive
dark matter halos compared to quasars There is less dier-
ence between the large-scale clustering environment of lu-

minous and faint radio sources However the small scale
r  1h1Mpc clustering environment of the brightest radio
sources appears signicantly denser than the environment
of the faintest sources This may indicate the eect of the
radio source on its immediate surroundings given that the
larger-scale environment is luminosity independent
8 CONCLUSIONS
We have cross-matched three large photometric samples of
LRGs to the FIRST and NVSS surveys to dene three sam-
ples of radio LRGs We have then measured the 2-point cor-
relation function to investigate the clustering properties of
the samples Similar to previous authors we nd evidence
that 1 radio LRGs are more strongly clustered than non-
radio galaxies matched in terms of luminosity and colour 2
the clustering strength of radio LRGs at r  1h1Mpc in-
creases with radio luminosity up to L  1025 WHz and then
remains roughly constant but at r  1h1Mpc the cluster-
ing is independent of radio luminosity We further nd that
inconsistencies between the radio-LRG cross-correlation and
auto-correlation amplitudes may suggest that a simple lin-
ear bias model may be insucient to describe the relation
between radio-LRG andor LRG clustering and mass clus-
tering
However the primary goal of this work was to investi-
gate any evolution in the clustering strength of radio galaxies
with redshift We nd no evidence for evolution in the large
scale r  1h1Mpc clustering amplitude of radio-LRGs
We show that our radio  radio LRG autocorrelations are
consistent with previous authors indicating no evolution in
comoving coordinates in the redshift range 0  z  068
 6Gyr Furthermore we make use of cross-correlations
to increase the precision of our results and still nd no ev-
idence for evolution We then restrict our samples to ob-
jects with L  1026WHz and again nd no evidence for
evolution in the correlation amplitude Our results are con-
sistent with a single dark halo mass of 9  1013h1 M for
all radio LRGs in the redshift range 0  z  068 This
could be compared to quasars that appear to inhabit halos
of mDH  3  1012h1 M again reasonably independent of
redshift and luminosity The signicantly more massive halos
for the high-luminosity radio galaxies at least may provide
a problem for unied AGN models Finally our radio-LRG
cross-correlations are inconsistent with a model in which
LRG clustering follows a long-lived model and radio sources
are randomly sampling the LRGs
