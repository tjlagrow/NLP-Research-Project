ABSTRACT
We analyze the spatial and velocity distributions of conrmed members in ve mas-
sive clusters of galaxies at intermediate redshift 05  z  09 to investigate the
physical processes driving galaxy evolution Based on spectral classications derived
from broad- and narrow-band photometry we dene four distinct galaxy populations
representing dierent evolutionary stages red sequence RS galaxies blue cloud BC
galaxies green valley GV galaxies and luminous compact blue galaxies LCBGs For
each galaxy class we derive the projected spatial and velocity distribution and char-
acterize the degree of subclustering We nd that RS BC and GV galaxies in these
clusters have similar velocity distributions but that BC and GV galaxies tend to avoid
the core of the two z  055 clusters GV galaxies exhibit subclustering properties
similar to RS galaxies but their radial velocity distribution is signicantly platykurtic

compared to the RS galaxies The absence of GV galaxies in the cluster cores may
explain their somewhat prolonged star-formation history The LCBGs appear to have
recently fallen into the cluster based on their larger velocity dispersion absence from
the cores of the clusters and dierent radial velocity distribution than the RS galax-
ies Both LCBG and BC galaxies show a high degree of subclustering on the smallest
scales leading us to conclude that star formation is likely triggered by galaxy-galaxy
interactions during infall into the cluster

Introduction
A substantial body of astronomical research conducted over the last several decades has
established that environment strongly modulates galaxy properties such as star formation rate
Gomez et al 2003 and gives rise to the so-called morphology-density relationship Dressler 1980
seen in the nearby Universe These studies paint a picture in which dense cluster environments
transforms blue star-forming galaxies into red queiscent galaxies at much faster rates than in the
low-density eld However the responsible mechanisms and timescales for these transformations
in clusters remain a matter of debate Boselli  Gavazzi 2006
An important factor aecting the evolution of individual cluster galaxies is thought to be the
nature of their orbits within the cluster highly-radial orbits are far more susceptible to eects such
as ram-pressure stripping that quench star formation Solanes et al 2001 Iannuzzi  Dolag 2012
Certain studies of low-redshift clusters nd that star-forming galaxies are more likely than passive
galaxies to occupy radial orbits Biviano et al 1997 Mahdavi et al 1999 Biviano  Katgert 2004
suggesting that recent infall accounts for todays star-forming cluster galaxies Other studies report
contradictory results for nearby clusters Ramrez  de Souza 1998 Hwang  Lee 2008 and possi-
ble evolution with redshift for the quiescent population Ramrez et al 2000 Biviano  Poggianti
Motivated by a desire to clarify this picture we seek to quantify how location and kinematics
aect the evolution of cluster galaxies To do so we examine the available phase-space properties
ie the projected spatial and velocity distributions of dierent optically-identied populations
in galaxy clusters at intermediate redshift By identifying galaxies undergoing rapid evolution
and studying their phase-space properties we hope to gain insight into how galaxies in clusters
evolve from the actively star-forming phase into passively evolving systems Well-known examples
of these transitional galaxy types include post-starburst EA galaxies Dressler  Gunn 1983
and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies ULIRGs Soifer et al 1984
The present study focuses on two other evolving galaxy populations that we can readily identify
 3 
on the basis of their photometric properties alone green valley galaxies and luminous compact
blue galaxies Green valley galaxies GV Wyder et al 2007 occupy a region in optical color-
magnitude space straddling the dividing line between the well-dened red sequence and the blue
cloud Wyder et al 2007 Luminous compact blue galaxies LCBG are an extreme class of star-
forming galaxies rst identied in optical multi-color QSO surveys Koo  Kron 1988 The LCBG
class is characterized by small physical sizes Re  2 kpc based on HST imaging Koo et al 1994
and narrow line widths 30    80 km s1 based on Keck spectroscopy Guzman et al 1997
In all such transitional populations major changes in their properties  including morphol-
ogy luminosity and color  are believed to occur quickly relative to the age of the Universe
consequently galaxies transiting between active and quiescent phases are relatively rare Their
remarkably low space densities in the eld make it dicult to gather samples suciently large to
enable meaningful analysis however the higher space density of galaxies in clusters permits the
study of statistically-signicant sample sizes providing snapshots of galaxy evolution at specic
cosmic epochs
The GV galaxies are believed to represent a transitory population between the GC and RS
phases Coil et al 2008 Salim et al 2009 As with the colors of the galaxies the morphology
in terms of concentration and asymmetry of GVs are intermediate between these two classes
Mendez et al 2011 The GV class has not been well studied to date as a distinct cluster pop-
ulation although spectroscopically-identied post-startburst galaxies eg EA galaxies have
received much attention in the literature eg Barger et al 1996 Tran et al 2003 Muzzin et al
Our interest in LCBGs stems from the suggestion that in the eld these galaxies rapidly
evolve from intermediate redshifts to form dwarf ellipticals in present day clusters In this scenario
given the relative abundance of dwarf ellipticals in clusters a surfeit of LCBGs might be expected
in intermediate redshift clusters Crawford et al 2006 2011 found that the number density of
LCBGs was enhanced in cluster environments by a factor of 749  116 at z  05 but the cause of
this increased density of relatively rare objects is not understood
In a series of papers Crawford et al 2006 2009 2011 we have explored the red quiescent
and blue star-forming populations in a half-dozen rich clusters over the redshift range 05  z  1
Our aim has been to understand how these general populations evolve dierentially with respect
to the eld In this work we compare and contrast the phase-space distribution of various galaxy
populations to obtain insight into the morphology-density relationship star-formation quenching
and population transformation in clusters We isolate the LCBG and GV transitional classes from
the global red and blue cluster populations based on their colors and radial proles Our work builds
upon a deep optical imaging survey from the WIYN 35 m telescope1 and spectroscopic follow-up

University and the National Optical Astronomy Observatories

from the DEIMOS spectrograph Faber et al 2003 on the Keck II Telescope of the W M Keck
Observatory The parameters of each of our clusters is listed in Table 1 Details of the observations
appear in Crawford et al 2009 and Crawford et al 2011
Our paper is organized as follows In 2 we describe our photometric classication scheme for
dierent populations in 3 we describe our method for culling a reliable cluster sample for objects
with spectroscopic redshifts in 4 we analyze dierent projections of the accessible phase-space
distribution in 5 we consider the subclustering of the dierent populations we discuss our results
in 6 and summarize our ndings in 7 Throughout this paper we employ the following acronyms
to refer to dierent classes of galaxies dened in 2 red sequence RS blue cloud BC green
valley GV and luminous compact blue galaxies LCBGs
2 Photometric Classication
We separate the galaxies in each eld into distinct samples regardless of cluster membership
based purely on their rest-frame photometric properties color luminosity and surface brightness
Building on the work of Crawford et al 2011 we dene four galaxy samples
 Red sequence RS galaxies are dened as objects redder than dividing line between blue and
red objects which we dene as UB  0032MB 21520204 following Willmer et al
20062
 Blue cloud BC galaxies are taken to be bluer than this same dividing line
 Green valley GV galaxies occupy an 02-mag-wide strip in color centered on the line between
RS and BC galaxies cited above the adopted denition is comparable to others found in the
literature eg Coil et al 2008
 Luminous compact blue galaxies LCBGs are a subset of the BC class dened as having
B  V  05 B  21 mag arcsec2 and MB  185 Garland et al 2004 Crawford et al
A shortcoming of the above denitions is that the GV class overlaps the BC and RS classes
in color-magnitude space making the classication of GV galaxies ambiguous In order to enable
statistical comparisons between independent samples of galaxies we choose to redene the RS and
BC classes to exclude the GV galaxies thus in our ensuing analysis we dene exclusive-RS
RCX and exclusive-BC BCX subsamples to be the RS and BC subsamples excluding the
intermediate-color GV sample Table 2 summarizes our adopted galaxy types An example of the
selection for dierent sources is shown in Figure 1
2This denition is based on a 025 mag shift in the zeropoint of the color-magnitude relationship at intermediate
redshifts

3 Cluster Membership
Since our ultimate goal is to compare and contrast the properties of various galaxy types
within clusters we must dene which galaxies are bona de members of their respective clusters
To avoid biasing the samples either for or against any type of galaxy we require a method which
is blind to the intrinsic properties of the galaxy eg color morphology or spectral type We
adopt the customary strategy of applying a test called the shifting gapper which analyzes the
velocity distribution of galaxies in each eld to determine which targets belong to the cluster eg
Fadda et al 1996 Lopes et al 2009 We also apply a radial cuto to exclude galaxies lying more
than a certain distance from the cluster center in projected space Due to the interdependence
in the determinations of the velocity dispersion and the radial cuto we developed an iterative
approach to solve the problem as described next
31 Velocity Cut Algorithm
To determine which galaxies were members of a given cluster we began by employing the
shifting gapper method to dene the cuto in radial velocity but modied the algorithm in two
important ways
 The velocity gap size used to distinguish members from interlopers is based on considering
the N nearest neighbors in clustocentric radius rather than by constructing bins of size
04 Mpc in clustocentric distance or having at least N members Our approach eliminates
the discontinuities inherent in a binning-based analysis and ensures that the same number of
galaxies is used in each computation of the gap size
 We employed the absolute value of the peculiar velocity in the analysis rather than the raw
value since clusters are approximately symmetrical in radial velocity space
Given the distribution of galaxy clustocentric radii Ri and the corresponding peculiar veloc-
ities vpeci any given galaxy is classied as either a cluster member or non-member as follows
1 Locate the N galaxies whose radii R from the cluster center are closest to Ri We take N to
2 Within this sample of N targets identify the subset of those targets which have vpec  vpeci
and measure vpec the biggest gap in the distribution of absolute peculiar velocity within
this sample
3 If the gap size vpec is less than a selected maximum value vmax then this object is accepted
as a member otherwise it is classied as a non-member
The procedure is depicted graphically in Figure 2
 7 
Fig 2 Application of the shifting gapper algorithm for determining cluster membership The
distribution of absolute peculiar velocity vpec as a function of clustocentric distance R is shown
for galaxies in one of our elds To determine whether a particular galaxy indicated by the open
triangle at Ri vpec i is a member of the cluster we form a neighbor sample consisting of the 30
galaxies with R values closest to Ri such galaxies occupy the shaded region centered on the galaxy
of interest are are indicated by open squares Within this subsample we search for the largest
gap in the distribution of vpec considering only vpec  vpec i In the case of this particular
target we nd the maximum gapsize to be 1015 km s1 Since this gap size exceeds the maximum
permitted value for cluster members taken to be 1000 km s1 this galaxy fails the membership
criterion and is rejected as a cluster member Other objects which were similarly rejected are shown
as X symbols while those classied as members are shown as lled or open squares

32 Radial Cut Algorithm
In addition to the velocity cut it is necessary to dene an outer limit in projected radius for
cluster members To exclude galaxies which are not bound to the cluster we required targets to
lie within the virial radius of the cluster estimated via
R200 
where R200 is the radius at which the density of the cluster is 200 the critical density of the
Universe This follows directly for a singular isothermal sphere   R2 where p is the projected
velocity dispersion of the cluster and Hz is the value of the Hubble parameter at the cluster
epoch3
Iterative Estimation of Cluster Parameters
The velocity and radial criteria described above are interdependent The value of p from
which R200 is derived depends on which galaxies are included in the sample thus to measure p
we should exclude those presumably unbound targets lying outside R200 However the formula
for R200 requires a measured value of p hence the process is circular We thus adopted an
iterative approach to reject interlopers while simultaneously deriving values for the cluster redshift
z terminal radius R200 and projected velocity dispersion p
Given a rst estimate of the cluster redshift which is derived by nding a peak in the redshift
distribution the method proceeds as follows
1 We compute the peculiar velocities of all galaxies measured in the cluster rest frame relative
to the nominal cluster redshift then exclude all galaxies with peculiar velocities exceeding
10000 km s1 in absolute value
2 We employ our modied shifting gapper method 3 to exclude interloping galaxies based
on peculiar velocity
3 Using the subset of galaxies which pass the interloper rejection test we recompute the cluster
redshift z and projected velocity dispersion p using robust biweight-based estimates of
location and scale Beers et al 1990
4 Given the measured value of p we compute R200 via eq 1 then convert this physical value to
an angular measurement based on the cluster redshift and assumed cosmological parameters
5 We repeat the previous 3 steps now excluding targets which lie outside of R200 as well as
those which fail the shifting gapper test
3We adopt H0  70kms1Mpc1 m  03 and   07 throughout
 9 
We continue this iterative procedure until the value of p and the number of cluster members
In practice convergence
stabilize within 1 or until a maximum 25 iterations are completed
generally occurs within ve iterations
34 Parameter Values
We now consider whether our results are sensitive to the particular values we chose for the
three key parameters in our process
1 The initial peculiar velocity window size used to reject obvious outliers taken to be 10 000 km s1
in the cluster rest frame
2 The number of neighbors N employed in the shifting gapper algorithm to compute the gap
size taken to be 30
3 The maximum permitted gap size employed in the shifting gapper vpec taken to be
1000 km s1
We explored this by using the Cl 001616 eld dataset as a testbed to investigate the depen-
dency of the derived cluster redshift cluster velocity dispersion and the number of cluster members
on the values of these parameters
Figure 3 shows the results of experiments in which we varied these parameters to gauge their
impact on our measurements of three key cluster properties the derived number of cluster members
the central redshift z as characterized by the biweight estimate of central location the derived
line-of-sight velocity dispersion p as estimated via the biweight estimator of scale Panels a
c consider the eect of changing the initial peculiar velocity window size Here galaxies with
an absolute peculiar velocity greater than the specied value were excluded from the subsequent
calculation of the cluster properties We repeated our analysis in the Cl 001616 eld using values
of the window size ranging from 1000 km s1 to 20000 km s1 Results indicate that the number
of derived cluster members the cluster redshift and the cluster velocity dispersion are completely
insensitive to changes in the window size parameter over the range 400019000 km s1 We
conclude that 10000 km s1 is a reasonable value for the window size
Similarly panels df show the eect on derived cluster properties of varying the number
of neighbor galaxies considered in computing the gap size for our implementation of the shifting
gapper algorithm The plots indicate that values in the range 26  N  50 yield similar results
for Cl 001616 We select N  30 to preserve locality
Finally panels gi illustrate the eect on derived cluster parameters of varying the maxi-
mum permitted velocity gap size 0  vpec  3000 km s1 in the shifting gapper algorithm
These plots indicate that values in the range 8001700 km s1 yield similar results We follow
Fadda et al 1996 and select vpec  1000 km s1

4 Phase-space Distribution of Cluster Populations
For clues into what processes drive galaxy evolution in these clusters we investigated whether
the star-forming and non-star-forming populations have dierent spatial andor velocity distribu-
tions Position-velocity and position-position diagrams for all galaxies with measured spectroscopic
redshfts in each of the cluster elds appear in Figures 5 through 8 They identify which objects we
consider bona de cluster members based on the protocol dened in 3 For these bona de mem-
bers the gures also distinguish objects by photometric type within R200 or to the limits of the areal
coverage of our WIYN multi-band photometry Crawford et al 2011 whichever is smaller The
gures show that the two lower-redshift clusters in our sample are rich and well-dened whereas
the higher-redshift clusters are less well sampled due to a combination of being intrinsically poorer
and having apparently fainter galaxies Lubin et al 1998 Postman et al 2001
As a consistency check on our membernon-member division in velocity space we have esti-
mated the cluster escape velocity as a function of projected clustocentric radius and displayed the
corresponding loci as lines in panels a and c of Figures 4 through 8 The estimates assume
isotropic orbits and a Hernquist 1990 density prole given by
2RcR1  RRc3
where Mcl is the total cluster mass and Rc is the core radius normalized respectively to M200
and R200 from Table 3 here and in Crawford et al 2011 Carlberg et al 1997 found that the
relation RcR200  066  009 yielded the best t to the galaxy surface density ensemble for
16 clusters in the redshift range 017  z  055 including two of our clusters Cl 001616 and
MS 045103 we adopt their radial size scaling However their estimate of  for Cl 001616 is
smaller than ours by about 16 We attribute this to two factors 1 rather than attempting to
distinguish individual cluster members from fore- and background galaxies Carlberg et al employed
a statistical correction which is subject to error 2 we have the benet of a substantially larger
representative sample of spectroscopic redshifts within R200 If we re-derive an estimate of  using
only the Carlberg et al sample we nd results consistent with theirs The higher value of  we
obtain is consistent with recent theoretical work Old et al 2013 Wu et al 2013 indicating that
a large sample of galaxies randomly selected over a range of magnitude and radius is needed to
accurately measure the velocity dispersion of a cluster
A comparison of our measured velocity dispersions with those from other studies shows good
general agreement Our measured value of the velocity dispersion of MS 045103 is in excellent
agreement with Borgani et al 1999 who measure a value of   1330111
2013 measure a slightly higher value of   1450105
159 km s1 based on only 47 sources Our value
for MS 105403 is lower but still in agreement with the velocity dispersion of   115682 km s1
from Tran et al 2007 The results for Cl J13243011 and Cl J16044304 are both smaller than
the previous measuments by Lubin et al 2004 of   1016126
154 km s1
respectively Our result for Cl J13243011 is signicantly smaller than the previous measurements

A range of line-of-sight escape velocities exists at any given projected radius Within the
uncertainties of the adopted values of RcR200 and these projection eects the identied cluster
galaxies do indeed lie within a region of phase space consistent with being bona de cluster members
Detailed mass modeling of and galaxy orbits within the cluster is beyond the scope of this work
Here our primary aim is to derive the characteristic values of the average line-of-sight velocity
distribution and spatial projection of cluster galaxies to determine whether they dier by type
41 Projected Velocity Distribution
To determine quantitatively whether the radial velocity distributions for the various subpop-
ulations dier we computed the rst four moments of the dierential velocity distribution oset
dispersion skewness and kurtosis results appear in Table 3 and Figure 9
Our analysis reveals no compelling evidence that the rst and third moments barycenter and
velocity skew dier consistently between the cluster subpopulations However we do detect certain
dierences in the even moments between various subsamples Specically we nd that the velocity
distribution is generally platykurtic ie displaying negative kurtosis boxier than Gaussian This
eect appears to be most pronounced for the GV subsample and somewhat larger for the bluer
star-forming populations relative to the red population overall
In terms of dispersion the second moment it is easiest to compare the populations if we
normalize the dispersions within a given cluster to the dispersion for that clusters dominant RSX
population as shown in Fig 9 and Table 3 Here we observe that the LCBG population has
a velocity dispersion which exceeds that of the RCX sample by a factor of 156  05 possibly
increasing with redshift A comparison between the radial velocity distributions for the LCBGs and
red cluster members via the Komolgorov-Smirnov K-S statistical test indicates that we can reject
with  90 condence the hypothesis that LCBGs are drawn from the same parent population
as the RSX galaxies For the GV and BCX classes the evidence is mixed Interpretation of the
larger LCBG velocity dispersion depends on their relative spatial distribution but certainly one
plausible explanation is that this population is not yet virialized The expected ratio between the
velocity dispersion of a virialized population and an infalling population is 2 Colless  Dunn
1996 Biviano et al 1997 which is consistent with the value found for the LCGGs here In short
the GV and LCBG classes appear to stand out in their velocity distributions as being respectively
boxier and broader We return to the implications of these ndings in 6

from bootstrap resampling in our ve clusters for a particular galaxy type as indicated on the plot
Panels in the top row depict oset from the nominal cluster redshift the dashed line indicates zero
oset Panels in the second row show the ratio of p measurements for each galaxy class in each
of our cluster elds vs the value of p for the RSX-class objects in that cluster The horizontal
dashed line at a value of 1 indicates equality of the scale measurements for the indicated subclass
and the RSX subclass Panels in the third row show skewness Positive skewness indicates that
the distribution is skewed to velocities greater than the cluster mean Panels in the bottom row
display kurtosis Positive kurtosis indicates that the distribution has more weight in the tail than a
Gaussian In each panel the shaded region is centered on the weighted mean value of the clusters
in the sample and spans the 1  condence interval on the mean

42 Projected Spatial Distribution
The spatial distributions of the dierent cluster populations are presented in Figures 58 For
each cluster and galaxy class we also calculate the center major axis length a ie the second
moment of the galaxy spatial distribution ellipticity e position angle  skewness and kurtosis
of the distribution To compensate for incompleteness in our sample we applied a correction
derived by estimating the completeness of the spectroscopy as a function of projected position and
spectral type each object is then weighted by the likelihood of having a measured spectroscopic
redshift The weight is calculated both based on spectroscopic sampling and color of the object
The grayscale background in Figures 48d represent the overall completeness as a function of
spatial position for each of our elds We present the spatial distribution statistics in Figure 10
and Table 4
The analyis reveals similar spatial-distribution characteristics ellipticity skew kurtosis be-
tween subpopulations in a given cluster and between clusters as a whole There is little skew mild
negative kurtosis  1 and a mean cluster ellipticity of 04 The greatest distinction between
subpopulations is exhibited in the size distribution and de-center relative to the BCG The BCX
population has the largest spatial distribution and the largest oset on average while the RCX
values are the smallest The BCX decenter values are three times more than that for the RCX
galaxies but still well below the cluster core radius RCX size distribution is roughly 60 that for
the BCX population or roughly 20 of the volume The GV and LCBG values are intermediate
between the BCX and RCX population values in the mean but exhibit more scatter from cluster
to cluster
421 Projected Radial Distribution
We also computed the projected radial surface density distributions for each of the dierent
populations and present the results in Figure 11 To account for spectroscopic incompleteness
in our survey we applied a correction in computing these distributions following Crawford et al
2011 The rst step was to calculate the photometric galaxy classication assuming every object
in the eld was at the redshift of the cluster We then summed the number of galaxies in a given
classication within each of our radial bins Next we computed the ratio of spectroscopically-
conrmed cluster members of a given class to the total number of objects with spectroscopy that
had the same photometric galaxy classication This ratio was calculated within each of the radial
bins that we used and then applied to that radial bin Finally the corrected number density of
galaxies was divided by the area of the radial bin to produce the surface density of galaxies We
only measured the surface density proles out to the terminal radius of our WIYN survey

422 Trends and characteristics
All of these clusters exhibit a strong red sequence that peaks in the central region and falls
o with radius while the other classes of galaxies tend to show cored proles ie proles with
a decit of galaxies in the central region This contrast can be seen in Fig 11 as a paucity of all
but RCX galaxies within 02R200 particularly in the three most massive clusters For BC LCBG
and GV types the number of galaxies with RR200  02 is signicantly less than the number of
galaxies that would be expected if they had the same prole as red sequence galaxies This relative
lack of star-forming galaxies observed in the cluster core appears consistent with previous studies
of rich clusters Thompson 1986 Ellingson et al 2001 Crawford et al 2006 Mahajan et al 2010
Within the three higher-redshift clusters the spatial distribution of member galaxies appears
more irregular The most massive of the three MS 045103 shows similar behavior to the two
lower-redshift clusters but with a much higher density of GV and BC objects within its core
The two slightly-lower-mass clusters show a much more irregular distribution of member galaxies
This pair of clusters shows far more blue galaxies within their central regions This diminution
of the morphology-density relationship has also been reported previously eg Cooper et al 2008
Tran et al 2010 Hilton et al 2010 Hayashi et al 2010
Visual inspection of the clusters reveals distinct patterns in the spatial distribution of the
galaxies of dierent spectral type which we characterize here
MS 045103 Fig 4 appears as a concentrated massive cluster with the central region dominated
by RS galaxies Its shape is an elongated ellipse with higher galaxy density along the major
axis an eect previously reported by Moran et al 2007 Most of the red galaxies lie along
this axis whereas blue galaxies are primarily located on the periphery Moran et al posited
that MS 045103 had two large laments feeding it which explains the spatial and velocity
distribution seen for the cluster A very high fraction of blue galaxies 56 on the interior of
the cluster are LCBGs while only 9 of galaxies within the core of the cluster R  05R200
are GV galaxies
Cl 001616 Fig 5 is a massive galaxy cluster dominated by a very strong and extended distri-
bution of RS galaxies These galaxies form a highly elliptical distribution with evidence of
strong lamentary structure beyond R200 Similar to MS 045103 43 of blue galaxies are
LCBGs but such galaxies are nearly absent in the cluster core GV galaxies are distributed
throughout the cluster but still comprise only 12 of the population within R200
Cl J13243011 Fig 6 is a very diuse cluster with a small population of RS galaxies Blue
galaxies are the dominant subclass within the cluster although RS galaxies form a small core
which is oset from the overall distribution The ratio of LCBGs to blue galaxies is relatively
high at 50 whereas GV galaxies comprise 13 of the total population
MS 105403 Fig 7 is a higher-redshift analogue to MS 045103 and Cl 001616 with a compact
 25 
core of RS galaxies an overall elliptical galaxy distribution and blue galaxies dominating the
periphery It has a high fraction of blue galaxies 56 within the cluster core GV galaxies are
spread throughout the cluster and have a similar distribution to the blue galaxies comprising
18 of the population
Cl J16044304 Fig 8 is also a very diuse cluster with an extended distribution of blue galaxies
around a loose core of RS glaxies The ratio of LCBGs to blue galaxies is extreme at 66
but the cluster is nearly devoid of GV galaxies 6 of all sources
5 Subclustering
51 Dressler-Shectman Test
We applied the Dressler-Shectman DS statistical test to determine whether signicant sub-
structure exists in our clusters Dressler  Shectman 1988 The classical DS statistic is calculated
by computing a local velocity mean vlocal and velocity dispersion local for each galaxy and
comparing these to the global values for the cluster It is calculated via the relation
2 vlocal  v2  local  2
where Nobj the number of nearest neighbors considered in the computation is traditionally taken
to be 10 As such the statistic measures substructure in bulk ow and velocity dispersion on a
density-dependent spatial scale For each cluster we also compute   P  a quantity which
charcterizes the overall substructuring in a cluster The signicance of the substructure can be
determined by comparing  to the results of a Monte Carlo simulation where the velocities of the
sources have been randomized Each simulation was run 1000 times to compute the probability P
that sim  obs We have computed  for the overall galaxy population but also for each of our
subclasses For each of the tests we only measured  for galaxies that lie within the WIYN eld
of view so that we could compare the dierent subclasses
The results for each of our clusters appear in Fig 12 Individual clusters are described in detail
MS 045103 shows signs for some substructure as compared to the simulations with only 7 of
the simulations having  as high as that observed for the entire cluster population The
elongated structure has been reported previously Donahue et al 2003 Moran et al 2007
and a triaxial distribution to the gas has been postulated as the most consistent t to the ob-
servations of the gas distribution Donahue et al 2003 In this cluster the blue populations
show more signal for subclustering than the red populations with the LCBG class having the
highest indication of subclustering
 26 
Cl 001616 shows no signs for substructure with a very smooth uniform distribution of galaxies
The cluster does exhibit a slightly elongated structure and is embedded in a much larger su-
perstructure Tanaka et al 2007 None of the subpopulations show any signicant dierences
in subclustering
Cl J13243011 shows no signs for substructure However the small population of LCBGs in this
cluster does show a higher degree of clumping than the other populations and there is a fairly
high degree of clustering within each of the populations
MS 105403 does show signicant evidence for substructure with only 5 of the simulations
showing the same degree of substructure There is also an elongated structure to the cluster
as well However none of the subpopulations show signicantly more substructure than the
others
Cl J16044304 does not show any signicant substructure The distribution of objects in the
cluster is very diuse The blue galaxies and the LCBGs do show evidence for being more
clustered into substructures than the other populations
On the whole the clusters present no coherent picture of the association of blue galaxies with
substructure on the scale of 10 nearest neighbors For the three most massive clusters only a small
fraction of the RS galaxies were associated with substructure and only in MS 045103 was a large
number of blue galaxies associated with substructure
52 Subclustering on dierent scales
For each subclass of galaxy we investigated how the galaxies were distributed on dierent
density-dependent spatial scales by varying the number of nearest neighbors to seek trends in
subclustering We made repeated measurements of the DS statistic with values of Nobj ranging
from 2 to 30 following Colless  Dunn 1996 Our results averaged over all clusters but segregated
by spectral type are shown in Fig 13 The average DS values at dierent Nobj for each type are
shown as osets from the DS values averaged over all galaxy types
This analysis indicates that the LCBGs show a stronger signal for subclustering at the smallest
scales as compared to the other galaxy types We interpret this as indicating that LCBGs are
preferentially found either in an interacting pair or a small group Likewise the blue galaxies
of which the LCBGs comprise a signicant number show a positive signal for subclustering at
small scales In contrast the red galaxies show no sign of subclustering at small scales and the
GV galaxies are actually strongly anti-clustered at the smallest scales Nobj  5 compared to the
overall cluster population At larger scales Nobj  12 the red and GV galaxies show stronger
indications of being a part of cluster substructure ie the clusters themselves whereas the blue
galaxies exhibit a more uniform distribution

To further explore the small scale clustering of LCBGs we considered the relationship between
a given galaxys radial velocity and that of its nearest neighbor viewed in projection on the sky
Figure 14 depicts the normalized distribution of the velocity dierence between each galaxy and
its nearest neighbor In this plot many more galaxies in the LCBG and BCX classes show small
velocity dierences with their closest neighbor indicating that these galaxies are more likely to have
radial velocities correlated with those of their nearest neighbor The K-S test rejects the hypothesis
that the distribution in nearest-neighbor velocities for LCBGs is drawn from the same distribution
as RS galaxies The pairwise velocity dierences for the GV and RSX galaxies are comparable to the
cluster velocity dispersion while the same quantity for the LCBG and BCX types is substantially
lower In particular the LCBG and BCX samples have a signicant enhancement of galaxies at
low dV namely at  30 of the cluster or roughly 300 km s1 comparable to the characteristic
binding energy of a typical galaxy This enhancement is a factor of two relative to GV and RSX
and 40 of the total fraction for each LCBG and BCX subpopulation
The results of our clustering analysis might depend on where we draw the photometric bound-
aries between dierent populations because these boundaries are intended to delineate galaxies with
distinct stellar populations However the dierences should not be apparent when boundary shifts
are made on scales comparable to the photometric errors 005 mag or less We can test this with
the green value GV sample that straddles the region in color-magnitude space here rest-frame
U  B and MB between the red sequence and the blue cloud Specically GV galaxies are dened
to lie in a 02 mag wide band in U  B that changes linearly with absolute magnitude 3 Since
the GV clustering statistics are similar to the RS clustering statistics we expect that shifting the
color-band to the red will not change the cluster statistics Shifting the color-band suciently to
the blue 02 mag should change the GV clustering statistics to more closely resemble those of the
BC The rapidity of this change will depend on the uniformity of the clustering statistics within
the BC sample which subtends a broader color range than the GV sample The relative similarity
between BC and LCBG clustering statistics suggests the clusering statistics within the BC sample
are rather uniform
Accordingly weve repeated the substructure measurements for the GV sample with 5 10
and 20 changes to their selection criteria ie 005 010 and 02 mag shifts to the red and the
blue of the color-band in U  B that denes the GV class All of the shifts of the color-band to
the red yield clustering statistics consistent with that of the nominal denition as we expect For
shifts of the color-band to the blue shifts of 005 mag yield no change shifts of 010 mag yield
clustering statistics intermediate between GV and BC samples while 02 mag shifts yield clustering
statistics comparable to the BC sample We conclude then that the transition in the clustering
properties between BC and RSGV samples is rather rapid in color 010015 mag and robust
to photometric errors

6 Discussion
In this work we have presented the spatial and kinematic distributions of several dierent
galaxy populations in massive intermediate-redshift clusters As expected the majority of cluster
galaxies belong to the red sequence RS class These have a compact distribution and show velocity
and spatial distributions similar to low-redshift massive clusters The clusters also have a large
fraction of blue BC galaxies as compared to lower redshift clusters This blue population tends to
be more extended and less centered than any of the other populations but has a signicant amount
of subclustering and velocity distribution boxier than the RS
We focus our attention here on the two transitional classes of galaxies LCBGs and GV galax-
ies which have spatial extents intermediate between the BC and RS populations but velocity
distributions that are boxier than the BC population The LCBGs and GV galaxies have dierent
subclustering amplitudes comparable to the BC and RS populations respectively In addition the
LCBGs are distinguished by a slightly enhanced velocity dispersion
61 The Distribution of LCBGs
The number density of LCBGs is enhanced in clusters indicating that the cluster environment
plays some role in triggering the starburst Crawford et al 2006 2011 this eect has also been ob-
served for 24 m sources around clusters at intermediate redshift Marcillac et al 2007 Fadda et al
2008 Geach et al 2011 Noble et al 2013 and for optically-identied star-forming galaxies in low-
and intermediate-redshift clusters Balogh et al 2004 Moss 2006 Porter  Raychaudhury 2007
Reverte et al 2007 Porter et al 2008 Oemler et al 2009 Mahajan et al 2012 A key aspect
in understanding the evolution of cluster LCBGs and star-bursting galaxies is determining what
triggers this phase of star formation
We have presented several pieces of evidence to indicate that the LCBGs represent a distinct
cluster population
1 LCBGs exhibit a radial velocity distribution which diers from that of RS galaxies showing
greater kurtosis
2 LCBGs in these clusters have on average a higher velocity dispersion than the other popu-
lations
3 The spatial distribution of LCBGs diers from the RS galaxies since the latter are found in
the cluster core while the former are not
4 LCBGs are more likely to occur in pairs or small groups as indicated by our subclustering
analysis
 32 
5 LCBGs are more likely to have a velocity similar to their nearest neighbors in projected
distribution on the sky
The dierences in velocity and spatial distribution indicate a population of galaxies that has not yet
achieved equilibrium within the cluster This distribution suggests that the LCBG class constitutes
an infalling population and does not show the centrally-peaked velocity distribution expected for a
backsplash population ie a population that has passed through the central region of the cluster
at least once Gill et al 2005
For an infalling population several possible triggers for star formation have been postulated
interaction with the ICM Fujita  Nagashima 1999 tidal forces within the cluster Bekki 1999
mergers of large subsubstructure Bekki et al 2010 and tidal interactions with other galaxies
Gnedin 2003 In all likelihood starbursts in clusters result from a diversity of causes with each
of the dierent methods contributing to the burst seen in the galaxy We can examine the likelihood
and evidence for the contribution of each of these dierent methods to the triggering of the LCBG
Fujita  Nagashima 1999 suggested based on hydrodynamic simulations that star forma-
tion initially increases as a galaxy approaches the cluster due to compression from the ICM and
then drops due to stripping from the ICM within 1 Mpc Likewise Kronberger et al 2008 used
simulations to nd that ram pressure stripping can also increase star formation rates in galaxies by
up to a factor of 3 and also create stripped baryonic dwarf galaxies The pressure at which these
processes becomes eective is much less than that required to strip the galaxy Bekki  Couch
2003 and so they can aect the star formation out to much larger radii In Cl J16044304 we
nd evidence for walls of LCBGs which may be associated with shock fronts in the cluster ICM
as proposed by Bekki et al 2010 However further investigation of the ICM properties in this
cluster are necessary to conrm these ndings
Clusters are expected to gain up to 40 of their stellar mass via mergers with groups that
have masses greater than 1013h1M McGee et al 2009 Simulations indicate that starbursts
could be induced via tidal forces during the merger process in member galaxies of the group Bekki
1999 as well as interactions with shocks in the ICM causing synchronized bursts of star formation
Bekki et al 2010 However in only one of our clusters MS 045103 do we nd evidence that
LCBGs are associated with large scale Nobj  10 substructure On the other hand within that
substructure we do observe a very large fraction of LCBGs In simulations Cohn 2012 showed
that only half of the simulated clusters experienced mergers with large groups although those
subgroups did tend to survive for long periods of time 4 Gyr for 50 disruption albeit the DS
test was unable to reproduce the substructure the majority of the time From our small sample
of clusters it is dicult to establish a correlation between LCBGs and substructure
Gnedin 2003 has shown that tidal heating especially from close galaxy encounters can
substantially contribute to the heating of galaxies in a cluster Furthermore Tonnesen  Cen
2012 found in their simulations that bound pairs in high density regions had higher fractions of
 33 
star-forming galaxies and that pair-bound galaxies also had a higher specic star-formation rate
than the galaxy population as a whole The pronounced subclustering of LCBGs at the smallest
scales could be evidence that this is the dominant phase for triggering the starbursts Of 89 LCBGs
in our sample 16 LCBGs have a conrmed nearby neighbor within 100 kpc and 150 km s1 with
an additional 37 having a potential nearby neighbor any source within 25 kpc In their sample
of low redshift LCBGs Perez-Gallego et al 2011 nd 45 of their sample to have a nearby
companion within 25 kpc which is similar to our fraction of potential neighbors
62 Green Valley Galaxies
Our observations show that the phase-space distribution of GV galaxies is both similar to
and dierent from the phase-space distribution of RS galaxies GV galaxies have a similar mean
velocity and velocity dispersion as the RS galaxies but the distribution is boxier ie having lower
kurtosis than the RS distribution The subclustering of the two populations has the same behavior
over dierent scales yet unlike the RS galaxies GV galaxies appear to be completely absent from
the cores of the clusters
If we consider a simple model in which GV galaxies evolve from quenched BC galaxies that
fall in along radial orbits this constrains the timescale for the GV phase to a maximum of  1 Gyr
Boselli  Gavazzi 2006 This also corresponds to the typical time for galaxies to move from the
blue cloud to the red sequence Martin et al 2007 Thus the quenching of the galaxies has to
begin near or beyond the virial radius which would closely correspond to the onset of ram-pressure
stripping in these clusters Moran et al 2007 The GV phase transition expected to last only
100200 Myr Martin et al 2007 would occur prior to the galaxy reaching the central cluster
However this model is probably overly simplistic In our massive clusters the ratio of GV to
BC galaxies is 03 which in this simple model would indicate either that the GV phase lasts closer to
300 Myr or that the infall rate was higher in the past Other than the cored prole the GV galaxies
share many similarities in the spatial and velocity distribution as the RS galaxies particularly in
terms of subclustering This indicates that the GV galaxies have been in the clusters for a longer
time period than the BC population and have made multiple cluster crossings assuming radial
orbits Wetzel et al 2013 nd that satellite galaxies are in clusters for 2-4 Gyrs prior to a rapid
quenching period which would be consistent with our results here
Furthermore the GV galaxies do not necessarily show signs of being a backsplash population
Gill et al 2005 but our observations do not reach beyond the virial radius where dierences
in line of sight velocity may further distinguish between virial infall and backsplash populations
Mahajan et al 2011 The GV do show an extended spatial distribution with many appearing on
the outer edges of the cluster suggesting that the quenching process may have started much earlier
or been far more eective at transforming BC galaxies to GV galaxies A picture consistent with
 34 
our observations is one where GV galaxies have long been cluster members but are preferentially
on larger and more circular orbits which enable them to retain and convert more of their gas into
stars over a longer time than their RS counterparts
In the eld at low redshift GV galaxies constitute approximately 10 of the population
Chen et al 2010 Of these up to 75 of the GV population show signs of AGN activity
Martin et al 2007 with many of those only being X-ray detected AGN Hickox et al 2009
Further multi-wavelength studies will be required to assess whether or not cluster GV populations
share a similar quenching mechanism with the eld population
7 Conclusions
We have explored the projected phase-space distributions of dierent classes of spectroscopically-
conrmed members in ve massive intermediate-redshift clusters The subclasses are dened by
multi-band photometry and correspond to reproducible denitions comparable to those found in
the literature for red sequence RS blue cloud BC green valley GV and luminous blue com-
pact galaxies LCBG The GV class straddles the locus separating the BC and RS subclasses
and the LCBG class is a subset of the BC sample with high surface brightness and small size We
have further dened BCX and RSX subclasses identical to BC and RS respectively except for the
exclusion of GV and LCBG galaxies
We have employed a technique a modication of the shifting gapper which allows us to
identify cluster members objectively and with minimum ambiguity In accordance with previous
studies we nd these distant clusters to harbor a larger fraction of BC galaxies compared to lower-
redshift counterparts of comparable mass  1015 M In these massive compact clusters the
fraction of galaxies in each subclass corrected for incompleteness down to a xed B-band absolute
magnitude of MB  185 mag over the redshift range of our clusters is 61  3 RSX 11  4
GV 26  6 BCX and 19  3 LCBG
Based on these spectroscopically-conrmed cluster members we have measured the projected
spatial and velocity distribution of all galaxy types in each cluster including updated measurements
of the velocity dispersion for each of the clusters We have also measured the clustering properties
of each galaxy subclass based on Dressler  Shectman 1988 over a wide range of clustering
scales following Colless  Dunn 1996 The clustering properties and projected phase-space
distribution of each galaxy subclass relative to the cluster barycenters show distinct patterns This
correlation of photometric spatial kinematic and clustering properties hints at a causal connection
between the star-formation history of cluster populations their infall and possibly their orbital
structure
Our spectroscopic observations and cluster-membership analysis conrm previous ndings
based solely on photometric data Crawford et al 2006 that in contrast to the RS galaxies BC and
LCBG populations avoid the cluster core The analysis here extends the nding of core-avoidance
 35 
to the GV population With these facts alone it is tempting to link the LCBG and GV populations
to subsets of the BC population that are in dierent phases of structural and dynamical transition
from an infalling starbursting population to an equilibrium quiescent RS population Specically
we nd all three classes BCX LCBG and GV have greater velocity kurtosis spatial oset and
radial extent than RSX with GV and LCBG being matchingly extreme in velocity kurtosis and
spatial ellipticity However this simple interpretation is contradicted by clustering analysis which
clearly links the LCBG galaxies to the BCX subclass by virtue of their close association with their
nearest neighbor and small-scale structure In distinction the GV population has subclustering
properties similar to the RSX population dominating the cluster cores
These ndings lead us to conclude the following regarding the transitional populations in these
clusters
 GV galaxies are long-lived cluster members that may be on preferentially circular and larger-
radius orbits than their RSX counterparts Such orbits would help GV galaxies retain more
of their gas and perpetuate star-formation relative to RSX galaxies While this interpretation
is not unique added support comes from the fact that a simple infall model is not sucient
to fully explain the properties of the GV galaxies
 LCBGs are extreme in their blue color high surface-brightness and small-scale clustering
amplitude even within the BC population These characteristics combined with their sys-
tematically larger velocity dispersion compared to other cluster subclasses depict LCBGs as
a radially-infalling population with star formation enhanced by group interaction and impact
with the intracluster medium
In future work we will probe the spectroscopic properties of these objects with the goal of obtaining
denitive answers about the star-formation timescales and dynamical masses of the transition
populations within these massive clusters
