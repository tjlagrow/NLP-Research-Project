Abstract We nd evidence for accelerated evolution in compact group galax-
ies from the distribution in mid-infrared colorspace of 42 galaxies from 12 Hick-
son Compact Groups HCGs compared to the the distributions of several other
samples including the LVLSINGS galaxies interacting galaxies and galaxies
from the Coma Cluster We nd that the HCG galaxies are not uniformly dis-
tributed in colorspace as well as quantitative evidence for a gap Galaxies in
the infall region of the Coma cluster also exhibit a non-uniform distribution and
a less well dened gap which may reect a similarity with the compact group
environment Neither the Coma Center or interacting samples show evidence of
a gap leading us to speculate that the gap is unique to the environment of high
galaxy density where gas has not been fully processed or stripped
1 Samples
The HCG dataset taken from Johnson et al 2007 comprises 42 galaxies from
12 groups The groups contain varying amounts of HI and span the three
classication categories discussed in Johnson et al 2007 The most HI gas-
rich groups with log MH I log Mdyn  09 are classied as type I  the HI
gas-poor groups with log MH I log Mdyn  08 as type III while type II
contains the intermediate groups
The LVL data discussed in Dale et al 2009 consists of 211 galaxies within
11 Mpc The SINGS data as described in Dale et al 2007 consist of 71
galaxies We combined the LVL and SINGS galaxies to create a control sample
referred to as LVLSINGS The 35 galaxies from the Spitzer Spirals Bridges
and Tails Interacting Galaxy Survey hereafter referred to as the interacting
sample are comprised of otherwise relatively isolated binary galaxy systems
whose members are tidally disturbed Smith et al 2007 The Coma sample
discussed in Jenkins et al 2007 is comprised of galaxies from two elds The
rst eld is located in the center of the cluster where the galaxy density is very
high The second eld is the infall region located near 04 virial radii at the

ies from type I HI gas-rich groups the triangles correspond to galaxies from
type II groups and the squares represent galaxies from type III HI gas-poor
groups The lower-left region of the plot contains galaxies whose light is dom-
inated by normal stellar populations while active galaxies ie star-forming
reside in the upper right Right Color-color plot of comparison samples The
grey plus signs are the HCG galaxies and the error bars in the bottom right
indicate typical errors for each sample The dashed lines indicate the crop-
ping values so that the analysis was done only over the range of colorspace
occupied by both the HCG galaxies and the comparison sample

Jenkins et al 2007 Our HCG sample has very few galaxies with luminosities
below log L45 ergs  409 Therefore to compare the HCG galaxies to
similar galaxy populations from the other samples we only consider galaxies
with luminosities greater than this
2 Colorspace
Galaxies with blue MIR colors have IR SEDs consistent with being dominated by
stellar light Galaxies with ongoing SF tend to have red MIR colors indicative
of PAH emission and warmhot dust The gap between these colors in HCG
colorspace may be due to rapid evolution through the stage during which galaxies
have intermediate MIR colors The dotted lines indicate the range of comparison
used for the statistical tests
3 Statistical Tests
The KS test comparing the HCG galaxies with a uniform distribution clearly
illustrates the gap manifested as the nearly-horizontal portion of the CDF The
two-distribution KS tests yield  values for the infall Coma sample high enough
that we cannot reject the hypothesis that they are drawn from the same parent
distribution as the HCGs over the range of comparison

4 Gap Region
The gap region is dened by HCG galaxies bounding gap at CM IR  031 and
038 indicated by the gray box in Figure 2 Since the gap represents a decit
of galaxies over this color range its signature is a attening in the CDFs We
excluded the interacting sample due to insucient data blueward of gap The
HCG sample has the most pronounced gap followed by Coma Infall

The morphology of the CMDs reects the criteria used to dene each sample
For example both Coma samples have a signicant concentration of galaxies
with blue MIR colors characteristic of galaxies with little to no SF while the
samples biased toward actively star forming systems show a scattering of galaxies
with red MIR colors The CMD of the HCGs is a composite of these two types
but has a decit of galaxies with intermediate MIR colors  a transitional phase
between no PAHs and strong PAH features

stripe
It is noteworthy that there does not seem to be a color-luminosity
correlation Right CMD for the comparison samples The criteria used to
dene each sample is apparent in the morphology of the CMDs
6 Discussion
We suggest that the distribution in MIR colorspace and particular the occurance
of a gap in the color distribution likely reect dierent star formation states
with galaxies ranging from activeecient red MIR colors to passiveinecient
blue MIR colors The distribution in colorspace suggests that galaxies in the
HCG environment move quickly from active to passive states in a manner sim-
ilar to but more dramatic than the environment on the outskirts of clusters
Galaxies from both more dense Coma center and less dense eg LVLSINGS
environments have a continuous distribution of systems between active and pas-
sive states
The presence of the gap in the MIR colorspace distribution of the HCGs
combined with the fact that the gap is not present in less dense environments
indicates that this type of local environment signicantly inuences galaxy prop-
erties In order to understand the processes that aect galaxy evolution we need
to understand how gas is processed in the interstellar medium and intragroup
medium in these environments Compact groups are clearly an important part
of understanding galaxy assembly and hierarchical structure formation
