ABSTRACT
We present the galaxy optical luminosity function for the redshift range 005  z  075 from the
AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey AGES a spectroscopic survey of 76 deg2 in the Bootes eld
of the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Our statistical sample is comprised of 12473 galaxies with
known redshifts down to I  204 AB Our results at low redshift are consistent with those from
SDSS at higher redshift we nd strong evidence for evolution in the luminosity function including
dierential evolution between blue and red galaxies We nd that the luminosity density evolves as
1  z054064 for red galaxies and 1  z164039 for blue galaxies
1 INTRODUCTION
The galaxy luminosity function directly quanties the
total light in galaxies and its evolution characterizes the
growth of galaxies over cosmic time either through star
formation or hierarchical assembly Since the rst sys-
tematic galaxy redshift surveys in the 1980s Huchra et
al 1983 the volume of the universe probed by uni-
form imaging and the number of galaxies with known
redshifts have grown exponentially With the advent of
large homogeneous imaging and spectroscopic surveys
of the nearby universe such as the Two Degree Field
Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dF Colless et al 2001 and
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS York et al 2000 as
well as large-scale photometric redshift surveys such as
COMBO17 Wolf et al 2003 the local z  02 galaxy
optical luminosity function is quite well constrained near

In order to measure the evolution in the eld galaxy
luminosity function one requires measurements at sev-
eral redshifts With the advent of more powerful tele-
scopes and instrumentation a number of pencil beam
surveys were used to quantify the galaxy luminosity den-
sity beyond z  05 eg Lilly et al 1995 Cowie et al

veys however often probe volumes too small to be rep-
resentative of the entire galaxy population ie cosmic
variance Recently several larger area surveys target-
ing many thousands of galaxies to z  1 have allowed
for more robust statistics of the high-redshift luminosity
function The VIMOSVVDS Deep Survey VVDS Le
Fevre et al 2004 has measured the evolution of the to-
tal galaxy luminosity function to z  12 with a sample
of 11000 galaxies Ilbert et al 2006 The DEEP2 sur-
vey Davis et al 2003 obtained redshifts for  40 000
galaxies with DEIMOS on Keck over  4 square degrees
and focused primarily on galaxies at z  07 with one
eld the Extended Groth Strip used to target galaxies
at all redshifts Comparisons between these high-redshift
surveys and low-redshift benchmarks yield our strongest
current constraints on the evolution of the galaxy lumi-
nosity function from z  1 to the present Willmer et al
2006 Faber et al 2007
While the low- and high-redshift ends of the interval
between z  0 and z  1 have been probed with large
statistical samples and volumes intermediate-redshifts
require an uncomfortably large area to be spectroscopi-
cally observed to moderate depth in order to measure the
evolution of galaxy properties Measurements at z  0
and z  1 can provide the overall trend with which
galaxy properties have changed over the latter half of
cosmic history but only measurements at intermediate-
redshift characterize this evolution on ner scales Fur-
thermore surveys at z  0 and z  1 may have dier-
ent systematic errors for example in photometric mea-
surements and calibration resulting in systematic errors
when measuring evolving parameters between surveys
Here we present the evolution of the galaxy optical lu-
minosity function from 005  z  075 from the AGN
and Galaxy Evolution Survey AGES
AGES is a spectroscopic survey of galaxies and quasars
in the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey NDWFS Jan-
nuzi  Dey 1999 Bootes eld using the Hectospec instru-
ment on the MMT Fabricant et al 1998 Roll et al 1998
Cool et al
Fabricant et al 2005 The Bootes eld was chosen for
our redshift survey because of the the wide array of deep
multiwavelength photometry available in the eld includ-
ing ground-based optical near-infrared and radio pho-
tometry as well as Spitzer Chandra and GALEX imag-
ing Most of these cover the full 9 deg2 footprint outlined
by the ground-based optical data AGES spectroscopy
reached IAB  2045 for galaxies and IAB  2195 for
AGN with extensions to IAB  2295 in some regions
The galaxy sample is about three magnitudes deeper
than the SDSS MAIN galaxy sample r  177 Strauss
et al 2002 and covers about twice the area probed by the
DEEP2 survey AGES is currently the largest spectro-
scopic survey of intermediate redshift eld galaxies and
thus provides an excellent sample of galaxies with which
to measure the evolution of the galaxy optical luminosity
function
In this paper we present a summary of the AGES
galaxy sample and optical imaging in 2 and give fur-
ther details of the galaxy selection function in Appendix
A Our photometry and k-corrections are described in 3
We present our luminosity function measurements in 4
including comparisons to SDSS and quantify its evolu-
tion before concluding in 5 Throughout the paper we
use a spatially at cosmology of m  03   07 and
H0  100h km s1 Mpc1 We use AB magnitudes for
all bands Oke 1974 although the photometric catalogs
from the NDWFS use Vega magnitudes1
2 OPTICAL IMAGING AND AGES SAMPLE
21 Optical Imaging
We use the deep optical BW RI photometry from the
93 deg2 Bootes eld provided by the third data release
from the NOAO Deep Wide-Field Survey Jannuzi  Dey
1999 A full description of the observing strategy and
data reduction is presented elsewhere Jannuzi et al in
prep Dey et al in prep and the data can be obtained
publicly from the NOAO Science Archive2 The NDWFS
catalogs reach BwAB  265 RAB  255 IAB  253
and KsAB  232 at 50 completeness for point and
are more than 85 complete for galaxies of typical sizes
and shapes to IAB  237 Brown et al 2007 Here
we utilize photometry from the DR3 release of NDWFS
imaging When performing k-corrections of AGES sam-
ple galaxies we augment the NDWFS imaging with 85
deg2 covering 77 deg2 of the NDWFS footprint of zcid48-
band imaging from the zBootes survey Cool 2007 The
typical 3 depth of these catalogs is 225 mag for point
sources in a 5 arcsecond diameter aperture Full details
of the data reduction and a full release of the zcid48-band
imaging catalogs can be found in Cool 2007 and the
NOAO Science Archive3
22 AGES
AGES used the Hectospec instrument on the MMT to
survey 9 deg2 of the NDWFS Bootes eld Full details of
the survey will be given in Kochanek et al 2011 here

we describe only the aspects relevant to the galaxy sur-
vey The nal AGES galaxy sample was selected from
the NDWFS optical imaging catalogs to IAB  2045
In addition galaxies must satisfy image quality cuts in
the I band and at least one of the BW or R bands As
the imaging data is several magnitudes deeper than the
spectroscopic sample in order for a galaxy to fail the Bw
or R detection thresholds due to galaxy color would im-
ply a galaxy with colors much more extreme than found
in existing surveys such as the SDSS Thus the require-
ment to include all three bands primarily limits the total
available survey area as it excludes regions where one of
the imaging data sets is missing In order to be included
in the sample we utilize for luminosity function measure-
ments we require a good quality detection in all three
BW  R and I bands in order to ensure robust and uni-
form k-corrections The NDWFS imaging is considerably
deeper than the spectroscopic ux limit thus requiring
detections in all three bands does not bias our sample
even for galaxies with peculiar optical colors Finally we
require that galaxy targets were detected as a non-point
source in at least one of the BW  R or I bands The
requirement that the galaxy be extended in at least one
of the three imaging bands places a physical size require-
ment into the sample but this limit is not physically
interesting for galaxies at the redshift and luminosities
probed by our sample For example for a galaxy at
z  05 to fall below r  12cid48cid48 it would correspond to a
physical size of r  74 kpc At the luminosity depth of
the survey at z  05 galaxies small enough to be unre-
solved by NDWFS imaging and yet pass the AGES ux
limit would represent a currently unknown population of
extremely luminous ultra-compact galaxies and thus we
do not consider this a likely source of incompleteness in
our sample
AGES employed a complex set of sparse sampling cri-
teria where galaxies with I  2045 which were also
bright at other wavelengths including in Spitzer Chan-
dra or GALEX imaging were more likely to be observed
However the sampling fraction in each galaxy subsam-
ple is known and hence we can correct for this sampling
function when constructing our luminosity function mea-
surements The lowest sampling rate for galaxies with
1895  I  2045 that failed all other targeting cuts
was 20 By weighting the galaxies by the inverse of the
sampling rate we can restore a statistically uniform sam-
ple with I  2045 Further details about our selection
function can be found in Appendix A
We observed our targets at the MMT 65 m telescope
over three years 20042006 The time allocation in
2006 was aimed at fainter AGNs only a few remaining
galaxies were targeted which we include here The Hec-
tospec instrument has a 1 degree diameter eld of view
patrolled by 300 robotically positioned bers An at-
mospheric dispersion corrector ADC ensures that light
losses due chromatic eects are minimized in the 1cid48cid485 di-
ameter bers The bers feed into a single spectrograph
with a 270mm grating which yields 6 A FWHM spectra
The data were reduced with two separate spectroscopic
pipelines described in Kochanek et al 2011 In 2004
some observations were done with the ADC functioning
improperly While the loss of light on these observa-
tions greatly impacts the spectrophotometry of the re-
AGES Galaxy Luminosity Function
plus the I  R color measured in a 6cid48cid48 aperture as the
aperture colors are much less sensitive to the low surface
brightness tails which aects the R-band imaging much
less than the I-band We then compare IR to the I-
band AUTO magnitude and compute Itot In the case of
sulting spectra we were still able to obtain redshifts for
the vast majority of the observed galaxies galaxies which
failed to generate redshifts with these observations were
re-observed in later years
In 2004 we covered most of the Bootes eld with 15
pointings each with 3 ber congurations These 15
pointings cover 76 deg2 and are taken to dene the
galaxy survey region Although we observed outside of
this primary region in 2005 in order to maximize our
AGN coverage we downweighted galaxy targets outside
of the 2004 region and thus exclude objects outside that
region in our analysis In 2005 and 2006 we covered the
eld with 63 congurations With a total of 108 cong-
urations plus the overlaps between the circular elds of
view each target galaxy had many geometrical opportu-
nities to be included in a ber conguration In detail
the target selection in 2004 was more restrictive than in
2005 Hence some objects were available to be observed
both years while others were only available during the
2005 and 2006 observations we account for this eect in
the survey selection function which is described in detail
in Appendix A
Because of the exibility of the robotic ber positioners
and the monthly queue campaigns AGES was observed
with rolling target acceptance After each observing run
galaxies which failed to yield a redshift were placed back
into the queue for subsequent runs As a result AGES
has a very high spectroscopic success rate Figure 1
shows the nal distribution of redshifts from AGES spec-
troscopy in the shaded region The full reweighted sam-
ple using the procedure described in Appendix A is
shown by the unlled histogram Over our 76 deg2 eld
the presence of large scale structure is apparent Figure 2
shows the two-dimensional distribution of AGES sources
color-coded by measured redshift The circular regions
in Figure 2 arise from the circular eld of view of the
Hectospec instrument
We give full details of the selection function in Ap-
pendix A In brief the parent galaxy sample has 26033
galaxies brighter than IAB  2045 We estimate this
photometric sample to be 4 incomplete AGES ob-
served approximately 50 of this parent sample 12473
galaxies Nearly all of the dierence is due to our a pri-
ori sparse sampling which can be corrected exactly with
our known targeting rates The sample has a 43 in-
completeness in assigning bers to targets and a 21
incompleteness in measuring a reliable redshift from an
assigned ber The Appendix describes our modeling
of these incompletenesses but the main point is that
AGES is highly complete and that the error in our in-
completeness corrections are smaller than our statistical
uncertainties
3 PHOTOMETRY AND K-CORRECTIONS
31 k-corrections
We construct our luminosity functions from the I-band
NDWFS photometry using the Sextractor Bertin 
Arnouts 1996 AUTO Kron-like Kron 1980 magni-
tude The I-band photometry is contaminated in certain
regions from the low-surface-brightness wings of bright
stars which bias the AUTO magnitudes brighter than re-
ality We address this by constructing a surrogate I-band
total magnitude IR from the R-band AUTO magnitude
Fig 1 Redshift histogram of primary sample galaxies from
AGES grey The unshaded histogram shows the re-weighted sam-
ple after the aects of our a priori sparse sampling have been re-
moved from the survey From this histogram alone one can see
the eects of large-scale structure even on our 76 deg2 eld
Fig 2 Angular distribution of AGES spectroscopic galaxies
The points show the spatial distribution of galaxies at 01  z 
075 At all redshifts large scale structure is apparent The circular
boundaries are dened by the circular eld of view of the Hectospec

we only include galaxies in the statistically complete main survey

two signicantly dierent values between I and IR Itot
is the fainter of the two magnitudes Otherwise Itot is
the average of the two Explicitly we compute
f  expIAUTO  IR2022
and use this to linearly combine the average ux of the
pair and the smaller ux of the pair
IAUTO  IR
f  1  f maxIAUTO IR
About 10 5 of the galaxies have a correction of more
than 01 05 magnitudes Most of the galaxies have a
tight correlation between Itot and IAUTO with an rms of
002 mag and cid104Itot  IAUTOcid105  0005 Because of this
slight scatter we cut our statistical sample of galaxies at
Itot  2040 this excludes 2 of the galaxies
When computing k-corrections we estimate the BW 
R and zcid48 magnitudes by adding 4cid48cid48 aperture BW  I and
R  I and I  z colors to Itot In other words the SED
colors of each galaxy is determined by the 4cid48cid48 aperture
colors while the total amplitude is set by the Itot mag-
nitude We nd only 1 shifts in the colors of galaxies
when we use PSF-matched images to measure aperture
colors Such shifts do not aect any of our results
All k-corrections are computed using kcorrect v4 2
Blanton  Roweis 2007 This procedure uses a lin-
ear combination of galaxy spectral templates with the
measured photometry and redshifts to construct a best-
t spectral energy distribution SED for each galaxy
in our sample These best tting SEDs are then used
to predict the luminosity and colors of each galaxy as a
function of redshift In order to minimize the eects of
the k-corrections on our nal results we shift to bands
that minimize the change in rest-frame wavelength be-
tween observed and rest wavelength at a typical AGES
redshift We use the I band to construct the 01r lumi-
nosity Throughout the paper we utilize a 01ugriz l-
ter system In this system the notation 01r denotes the
luminosity in the SDSS r band Fukugita et al 1996
shifted blueward by z  01 This is least sensitive to
the SED model at z  042 where the observed I-band
matches the rest wavelength of 01r  This choice also
makes it easy to compare to the SDSS luminosity func-
tion Blanton et al 2003 In order to compare our re-
sults to those in the literature we also use the BW band
to construct the B-band luminosity for each target
32 Red and Blue Galaxies
In order to probe the evolution of red and blue galaxies
separately we rst need to select each type of galaxy as
a function of redshift in the AGES sample As galaxies
especially on the red sequence have undergone substan-
tial passive evolution since z  1 a single rest-frame
color cut will not lead to a a homogeneous sample of red
and blue galaxies over a wide range of redshifts Here
we solve for the evolution in the red-sequence zeropoint
empirically and use that cut when dening red and blue
galaxies in the sample We rst construct the luminosity-
dependent statistic

used to separate red and blue galaxies as dened in the text
ous median value the cuto value of A  03 was chosen
to best localize the minimum of the galaxy number dis-
tribution in color at z  01 We use only galaxies with
M01r  20 in this procedure These medians converge
to the median color of the red sequence at M01r  20
We perform these medians in redshift bins of z  01
and nd values of Amed  274 269 264 260 256 252
for bins centered at redshifts 01 02 03 04 05 and
065 respectively We then dene our red and blue
galaxy samples by linearly interpolating the A param-
eter to the redshift of each galaxy galaxies which have
Agal  Amedianz  03 are classied as blue while those
redward of that limit are classied as red Figure 3 shows
the 01ur versus M01r color-magnitude relation in six
redshift slices from the AGES sample The bimodality
in galaxy colors is clearly seen in each slice The color
cut used to dierentiate between red and blue galaxies
in each slice is also shown
33 SDSS Comparison Sample
At low redshift the AGES luminosity function is sig-
nicantly impacted by large-scale structure and the lim-
ited volume we probe We therefore use the NYU Value-
Added Galaxy Catalog VAGC to construct a compari-
son sample of 571909 galaxies from the SDSS Blanton
et al 2005 based on the SDSS DR7 From this sample
we extract all galaxies with 001  z  015 which we
refer to as the SDSS sample

We then iteratively nd the median value of A for galax-
ies with A  Amedn1 03 where Amedn1 is the previ-
Based on the galaxy selection function described in
Appendix A we can reconstruct a statistical sample of
Itot  2040 galaxies We calculate luminosity functions
for these galaxies using two methods the 1Vmax method
and using parametric maximum likelihood models
41 The 1Vmax Method
The 1Vmax method is one of the more simple and in-
tuitive forms for deriving the luminosity function The
1Vmax method benets from being calculated without
the need for an a priori parametric form of the lumi-
nosity function In this paper we follow the techniques
described in Eales 1993 Lilly et al 1995 Ellis et al
1996 Takeuchi et al 2000 and Willmer et al 2006
For each galaxy in our sample we rst calculate zmax
and zmin the full range of redshift for which the galaxy
may have been selected through our direct Itot  204
cut including eects of the k-correction and luminosity
distance We then calculate the maximum volume each
galaxy could have occupied and been included when con-
sidering all galaxies in a given redshift range set by zlower
and zupper

42 Parametric Maximum Likelihood Methods
We also use a parametric maximum-likelihood t to a
Schechter function using the STY estimator Sandage et
al 1979 Efstathiou et al 1988 We utilize the standard
Schechter 1976 function of the form

luminosity M  given its observed redshift z and the sur-

where the integral is over the full luminosity range of the
survey and the selection function sM z includes infor-
mation about the sample ux-limit The corresponding
quantity for the full sample is the product of the likeli-
hood over all galaxies Finally we maximize the quantity
log pMjzj

as a function of the M and  parameters
Due to the ratio in equation 11 the normalization
 is unconstrained by the STY method We use the
minimum variance estimator of Davis  Huchra 1982
to perform the normalization

nosity density does not depend on the limiting magni-
tude of the survey but does depend on the form of the
luminosity function in order to extrapolate to the en-
tire population Since the majority of the luminosity
is located at M for a population following a Schechter
function only the highest redshift bins in this survey ex-
trapolate more than 50 of the luminosity density when
Cool et al
calculating the total j compared to the luminosity range
probed by the survey at the lowest redshifts considered
we probe 80-95 of the total galaxy luminosity density
43 Luminosity Function Results
Figure 4 shows the resulting optical luminosity func-
tions in the 01r band for SDSS galaxies at 001  z 
015 The points are the 1Vmax result and the lines are
the best tting STY luminosity functions We used this
SDSS luminosity function to t the value of the Schechter
 parameter when tting the AGES data as the AGES
luminosity function in the lowest redshift bin are limited
by the small volume probed We restrict our tting of
the SDSS data to galaxies between 23  M01r  18
This range was chosen to mirror the luminosities probed
by our AGES galaxy sample In order to test the eects
on this range we also t the SDSS data with faint limits
to M01r  17 and M01r  175 the range used in the
tting has no strong eect on the derived  parameters
Using STY determined luminosity function parameters
shown as lines in Figure 4 we nd   105  001
for the full galaxy sample   115  002 for the
blue galaxy sample and   050  002 for the red
galaxy sample Throughout the rest of our discussion
we hold these  values xed for each survey when tting
the AGES data For comparison the lowest redshift bin
in AGES yields values of   106003 for all galaxies
  046  009 for red galaxies and   115  004
for blue galaxies which is in excellent agreement with the
SDSS values but with larger uncertainties In order to
test the overall normalization of our luminosity function
measurements we calculate the number counts as pre-
dicted from the nal derived parameters and compare
these to the AGES target number density We predict
33101  118 14031  801 18501  118 galaxies per
square degree for all red and blue galaxies respectively
for galaxies with I  204 and 005  z  075 the error
term is dominated by the range of k-corrections associ-
ated with each population The AGES number counts for
galaxies in this magnitude and redshift range are 326961
14208 and 187513 for all red and blue galaxies
As the luminosity function has historically been mea-
sured in the B-band we also k-correct the SDSS galaxy
photometry to the restframe z  0 B-band and mea-
sure the galaxy B-band luminosity function from SDSS
for comparison Figure 5 shows the B-band luminos-
ity functions for SDSS galaxies at 001  z  015
Again we use the  values derived from these low-
redshift ts to x the values used when tting AGES
luminosity functions at higher redshift In the B-band
we nd that   099  002 for the full SDSS sample
  110  003 for blue galaxies and   045  002
for red galaxies
We show the 01r-band AGES galaxy optical luminos-
ity functions based on the 1Vmax method in Figures 6-8
and list our 1Vmax measurements in Tables 1-3 In each
gure the grey line shows the z  01 luminosity function
of all SDSS galaxies The data points show the 1Vmax
luminosity function measurements and the solid dashed
lines show the STY determined parameterization As
an added check on our luminosity function calculation
we further plot the summed red galaxy and blue galaxy
luminosity functions to compare the with total galaxy
luminosity function in Figure 6 the summed luminos-

galaxies as dened in the text As AGES is limited by large-scale
structure in the eld at the lowest redshifts we use these SDSS lu-
minosity functions as an anchor for the evolution we measure based
on AGES luminosity functions at higher redshifts Furthermore
we t the full shape of the SDSS luminosity functions using the
maximum likelihood technique ts shown with dot-dashed lines
to t the faint-end slope  of the galaxy optical luminosity func-
tion at z  01 Since our AGES luminosity functions do not
extend signicantly fainter than L at z  03 we x the  val-
ues used when tting AGES LFs to those determined from SDSS
Note that these agree with the estimates from the lowest redshift
AGES bin but have smaller uncertainties The inset illustrates the
covariance associated with the M and  measurements based on
these luminosity functions

function The typical luminosity of galaxies increases

best tting parameters determined from our STY ts are
listed in Table 4
We estimate uncertainties for our tted parameters us-
ing a two-part strategy First to include the eects of
small-scale structure and shot noise we use a jackknife
method We split the sample into 15 roughly equal-area
subregions on the sky the 15 AGES elds and repeat
our ts excluding one area at a time The rms variation
N  1 is an es-
between N such samples multiplied by
timate of the uncertainty in each parameter In this test
we calculate the luminosity density for each subsample
before the variance is computed in order to account for
the covariance between M and 
These jackknife error estimates would be correct if
the subregions were statistically independent from each
other However it does not account for the correlations
between subregions due to large-scale structure most no-
tably on scales larger than the survey region as a whole
This large-scale structure contribution can be calculated
from the two-point correlation function We compute the
AGES Galaxy Luminosity Function
Fig 5 Same as Figure 4 but showing the B-band luminosity
function for SDSS galaxies at z  01 Again we t the SDSS
luminosity functions to determine the local  value in the B-band
and then assume  is xed in redshift
large-scale structure contribution by averaging the cor-
relation function across all pairs in a given redshift shell
within our survey volume This gives the variance of the
fractional over density in the survey region As the AGES
survey is reasonably large we use the linear-regime power
spectrum from the WMAP-3 cosmology Spergel et al
2007 to generate the correlation function The averaging
over pairs is accelerated by projecting the partial corre-
lation function to the angular correction function using
the Limber approximation and then performing a Monte
Carlo angular integration using a set of points randomly
distributed in the survey area The results dier only
modestly from the rms density uctuations in a sphere
whose volume equals that of the survey in the given red-
shift bin
In detail the variance of the density eld of the full
region is not independent of the variance reported by
the jackknife method This is unavoidable while modes
much larger than the survey are invisible to the jackknife
method a single large cluster would aect the jackknife
errors as well as the overall density variation We re-
move this double counting by using the Monto Carlo in-
tegration to estimate the covariance matrix between the
15 sub-regions and predicting the jackknife variations in
linear theory
If we have N regions on the sky with areas Aj and a
total area of A then the covariance between the over-
densities Cijof two of the regions is

assumes that the densities from the N regions are be-

ume Our estimate of the fractional variance in the lu-
minosity density will be the sum of this variance and
the variance from the actual jackknife estimation By
subtracting o the linear theory jackknife prediction and
adding back the actual jackknife error we include the
non-linear aspects of the correlation function and the
shot noise to our error estimate As the AGES galax-
ies are not strongly biased relative to the dark matter
Hickox et al 2009 we expect this estimate to be a ro-
bust measurement of the variance from large scale struc-
For our six redshift slices we nd LSSj of 0277
0203 0168 0144 01128 and 0079 from low to high
redshift assuming a linear theory normalization of 8 
10 for galaxies In all but the highest redshift bin this
error is larger than the 5-10 jackknife variance estimate
in the luminosity density Hence the uncertainty in the
estimate of the luminosity density in AGES is dominated
by large-scale structure
Figures 9-11 show the redshift dependence of M 
and the luminosity density j for each of the three galaxy

In all three samples M is brighter in the past The slope
of this evolution is roughly 16 in all three cases We also
nd a drop in  toward higher redshifts predominately
for the red galaxies For the red galaxies the rise in

from our STY analysis As in Figure 9 the full galaxy sample is
plotted with black triangles the red galaxies with red diamonds
and the blue galaxies with blue squares The best tting evolution
is shown with solid dotted and dashed lines respectively We
nd that the number density of all galaxies has increased since
z  07 with the red galaxies showing the most dramatic increase
in number density The ts are constrained to go through the SDSS
measurement at z  01 lled circles as the lowest-redshift bin
from AGES is highly susceptible to large scale structure due to its
relatively small area of the survey When tting the data we use
a model of the form   1  P z We nd that the trend in the
full population P  059  014 is driven primarily by a sharp
decline in the red population P  095  010 while the blue
galaxies show much less evolution P  038  021
M balances the drop in  so the luminosity density of
red galaxies is roughly constant For blue galaxies the
rising M dominates and the luminosity density increases
by 60 from z  01 to z  06 The luminosity density
of all galaxies increases by 50 over the same epoch

44 Comparison with Previous Work
As the majority of work on the galaxy optical lumi-
nosity function has focused on the restframe B-band
we also measure the evolution of the AGES LF in that
band When constructing the B-band luminosity func-
tion the observed R-band is a close match to the eective
Fig 11 Evolution of the 01r luminosity density for all black
triangles blue blue squares and red red diamonds galaxies
from AGES The SDSS measurement at z  01 is shown by the
lled circles which have been slightly oset in redshift for clarity
We model the evolution as j  1  zn the best tting models
are also plotted as the solid dotted and dashed lines for the full
red and blue samples respectively We nd that the full sample
evolves with n  081  027 the blue galaxies with n  164 
039 and red galaxies with n  054  064 While the number
density of red galaxies has increased since z  07 the luminosity
density in red galaxies grows much more slowly over that time
For comparison the green dot-dot-dot-dashed line shows the sum
of the best tting trends for the red and blue galaxies the sum of
each population separately agrees well with the total population
within experimental errors
wavelength of the rest-frame B-band across the redshift
range probed by AGES with the closest comparison at
z  05 In order to properly construct the likelihood
when constructing this sample we implement an eec-
tive R-band magnitude cut on the sample to ensure that
the I-band AGES selection does not bias our sample to-
ward red galaxies This eective cut however has little
impact on our sample and results in the removal  05
of our sample galaxies when constructing the B-band
luminosity function We use the SDSS values for  at
z  01 derived from the luminosity functions in Figure 5
and assume the AGES B-band luminosity functions have
xed faint-end slopes relative to the SDSS value Figures

pared with luminosity functions from the literature for
all galaxies blue galaxies and red galaxies respectively
The 1Vmax luminosity function measurements are pre-
sented in Tables 6-8 The best tting STY parameters
for the B-band luminosity functions are listed in Table

ity density jB for all red and blue galaxies as well as

et al 2007 which include red galaxies with photomet-
ric redshifts also drawn from the NDWFS eld As the
Brown et al 2007 sample covers the same area based
on the same photometric data it shares the same photo-
metric systematics and large scale structure systematics
as our AGES data The dot-dashed lines and shaded ar-
eas show the best t evolutionary tracks for each type
of galaxy t using only the SDSS and AGES data The
shaded regions show the 1 condence regions based on
the AGES and SDSS extrapolated to z  1
Overall the extrapolations of the AGES evolution
agrees with the measurements made in the literature and
often lie between the measurements from DEEP2 and
COMBO-17 It it worth noting that if our extrapolation
is extended to z  1 the DEEP2 red galaxy luminosity
density is quite low while the Brown et al 2007 mea-
surement is slightly above our prediction Clearly the
ideal manner of studying the full evolution from z  1
to today however is a large deep survey of spectroscopi-
cally observed galaxies with the area and depth to probe
the full z  1 epoch with robust statistics
5 CONCLUSIONS
We have computed the optical
luminosity function
from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey sample
This is the largest spectroscopic sample currently avail-
able of eld galaxies at 03  z  07 At low red-
shifts the luminosity function from AGES is in excel-
lent agreement with the much larger SDSS dataset At
higher redshift we see clear evidence for evolution of the
luminosity function with M being brighter at higher
redshift We compute the evolution of the luminosity
density for the full sample as well as for the populations
of blue and red galaxies separately We nd that the
evolution of the luminosity density of red galaxies over
AGES Galaxy Luminosity Function
from the next generation of deep spectroscopic surveys
which probe larger volumes and constrain fainter galax-
ies will allow even tighter constraints of the evolution of
galaxies over the last half of cosmic history

THE AGES SELECTION COMPLETENESS FUNCTION
APPENDIX
AGES Galaxy Target Selection
In this section we outline the galaxy target selection process employed by AGES AGES also targeted quasars but
we will not describe that selection here full details on the AGES execution and target selection can be found in
Cool et al
Kochanek et al 2011 and Assef et al 2010
We targeted based on the NDWFS DR3 imaging catalogs For each band of NDWFS imaging we dene acceptable
photometry bgood rgood and igood the Sextractor ag FLAG  8 ie unsaturated not falling o a chip boundary
or heavily blended not agged as a duplicate object and which had photometric data available FLAG PHOT  0 All
targets were required to have igood and at least one of rgood or bgood Objects were classied as point sources if
the stellarity index Sextractors CLASS STAR parameter in at least one of the bands had CLASS STAR  08 Galaxy
targets are required to be extended by this criterion All ags discussed here use the default denition provided by
Sextractor
Galaxy targets were restricted to lie in the 1545  I  2045 magnitude range To avoid the problem of Kron-like
AUTO magnitudes being corrupted by the halos of nearby stars we impose limits on the aperture magnitudes of
selected objects If either of the 1cid48cid480 or 6cid48cid480 aperture magnitudes were extremely faint I1cid48cid48
0  2145 we
removed the galaxy from the sample These restrictions remove much of the low-surface brightness spurious objects
but not completely In order to correct for these low-surface brightness contaminants we rst ag objects which are
observed near bright USNO stars For each USNO star in the NDWFS eld we dene a scale length
0  2445 or I6cid48cid48
USNO  200cid48cid48  50cid48cid481545  RUSNO
If the closest USNO star is less than USNO from a galaxy then the galaxy was agged as being too close to the bright
star If the 6cid48cid48 galaxy aperture magnitude satised
I6cid48cid48  Itot  4Itot  204582
the galaxy was rejected Secondly if the galaxy was less than 05USNO from the closest USNO star the galaxy was
removed from the survey After these cuts we have a cleaned sample of possible galaxy targets Table 10 lists the
bright sample magnitude range faint sample magnitude range and faint sample sampling rate for each of the samples
dened for AGES spectroscopy and Table 11 lists the number of targets number of redshifts obtained and overall
completeness for each AGES galaxy sample Its important to reiterate that all of these are cuts in addition to the
I  2045 cut in essence a galaxy that was a bright detection from our multiwavelength imaging was given higher
preference for spectroscopy than galaxies undetected in these other bands
Completeness Corrections
We decompose the selection function into 4 terms First objects may not have passed target selection cuts due to
quirks of the photometry or some aspect of the targeting photometric incompleteness Second objects that would
otherwise have been selected may have been dropped from our statistical sample due to a priori sparse sampling
Third a high-priority object may have failed to have a ber allocated ber incompleteness Finally a spectrum
may have failed to yield a useful redshift redshift incompleteness
The AGES galaxy target selection sets ux limits in 12 bands of photometry However this complex set of targeting
criteria can be thought of as a simple I  2045 sample in which a priori sparse sampling has been done to de-emphasize
common objects while more heavily sampling the tails of the multicolor distribution It is easy to undo the sparse
sampling and restore a fair I  2045 sample as all of the targeting weights are known exactly We do not use objects
that were rejected by sparse sampling in our analysis though some of these objects did get a spectrum as a ller
object We construct the main statistical galaxy sample as the objects with high priority target ags with all three
optical bands present rgood igood and bgood to ensure good k-corrections and inside the primary galaxy survey
region
About 15 of objects fail either rgood or bgood There is little coherent structure to these so it is not a problem
of non-overlapping photometry However these objects also have a 25 redshift failure rate which is quite high
compared to the full sample It is likely these objects are corrupt we estimate that the requirements of 3 bands of
good photometry is likely only causing a 1 photometric incompleteness Furthermore we rejected galaxies from
AGES if they were too close to a bright star this aects about 2 of the survey region There are 762 SDSS MAIN
sample targets r  1777 inside the primary survey region 733 96 of these are in the AGES parent sample
and 709 93 end up being selected The 3 loss is due to the eects described above However the rst 4 is
yet unaccounted for Of course the SDSS has a small rate of spurious targets about 1 We therefore conclude
that at r  1777 we have an additional 3 incompleteness that we have not identied This could well improve as
one moves to the fainter objects that NDWFS was designed for In order to ensure that this 3 incompleteness is
appropriate for the full galaxy sample and not simply the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function which overlaps
with the SDSS MAIN sample we constructed fake galaxies with sizes and uxes representative of the AGES galaxy
sample and included them in the NDWFS imaging Reperforming a SEXTRACTOR analysis of the imaging we
nd that approximately 35 of the galaxies added to the images are unrecovered - typically due to deblending with
bright foreground galaxies or stars This incompleteness value does not strongly depend on the brightness of the
galaxy within the range of galaxy uxes considered for our luminosity function analysis Brown et al 2007 found
the NDWFS imaging dataset to be more than 85 complete for galaxies of typical sizes and shapes to IAB  237
several magnitudes deeper than we target with AGES As the optical imaging used to select AGES target galaxies
extends several magnitudes deeper than the ux limit of AGES spectroscopy we expect little incompleteness to arise
from photometric depth at the faint end of our targeting range
AGES Galaxy Luminosity Function
In sum we believe that the photometric incompleteness is 3-6 but at the very bright end eg I  15 there is
surely more incompleteness The primary galaxy survey region is 790 deg2 We adopt a 4 catalog incompleteness
and adjust the ducial area to 760 deg2 The large-scale structure corrections remain tied to the larger area because
the incompleteness is in many small disjoint regions
In order to test the eects of star-galaxy separation on our target selection we rst compare the stellarity classica-
tions between NDWFS and SDSS imaging We restrict this comparison to bright SDSS objects with robust stellarity
measurements as the depth of NDWFS is considerably deeper than SDSS extending to the detection limit of SDSS
leads to identifying problems with the SDSS star-galaxy separation at faint uxes rather than to understand the role
of NDWFS star-galaxy separation on our luminosity function measurements The NDWFS photometry reproduce
the stellarity measurements from SDSS in this regime In order to quantitatively test how the separation of stars
galaxies eects fainter NDWFS targets we select all objects with IRAC colors consistent with arising from galaxies
and inconsistent with being either stars or AGNs We nd that  03 of these objects were classied as stars based
on their NDWFS stellarity measurements and conclude that our samples do not suer signicant incompleteness due
to galaxies becoming poorly resolved in the NDWFS imaging
Only 1 of the AGES main-sample galaxies lack counterparts in SDSS imaging Nearly all of these are low surface
brightness objects that are plausibly below the SDSS detection limit Thus we can limit the rate of spurious objects
in the AGES sample to below 1 In 2005 AGES targeted nearly 300 bright objects typically r  17 that SDSS
declared as stars which is conrmed by AGES spectroscopy These objects saturated the NDWFS imaging and were
mistakenly classied as extended by the star-galaxy separation To remedy this we remove all objects at r  19 that
SDSS called a point source NDWFS and SDSS agree very well on extended sources between r  17 and r  20
SDSS obtained redshifts for 27 galaxies included in the AGES primary sample that we didnt observe at the MMT
We consider these galaxies as having good redshifts when computing ber and redshift incompleteness
AGES performs very well as regards to ber completeness most regions of the survey were observed at least six
times so even high multiplet groupings could be resolved In total 957 of targets were observed Fields 13-15
however were not as well sampled in 2005 Field 14 is the worst with only 83 completeness Fields 1-12 have
ber completeness of 983 The level of ber incompleteness depends on the local environment of the galaxy as
ber collisions are a major source of the problem though not the only source To address this we seek to assess
completeness as a function of local density and number of opportunities for each object to be observed We rst split
the objects into those that were high-priority targets in 2004 and those that were not The 2004 targets have a much
higher completeness and are thus treated separately from objects observed in 2005 and 2006 For each object we
count the number of high-priority targets within 30cid48cid48 For the 2004 targets we divide them into sets according to the
neighbor count and dene the ber completeness as the fraction of objects in each bin that received a ber For the
2005 targets we repeat this but restrict the count to high-priority targets that ere not observed in 2004 We also
separate the binning into objects that fell within the eld of  4 4 5 or  5 observations in 2005 and 2006 In other
words the ber completeness of 2005 targets is judged in sets dened by the number of 2005 nights and the number
of 2005 and 2006 opportunities In the extremes of the distribution a bin can have zero observed galaxies and yet
not be empty from non-observed galaxies which would result in an innite weight In these cases we add objects to
the next bin until we have a galaxy that can be up-weighted to compensate for the missing ones Figure 16 shows the
distribution of the nal ber completeness correction derived here as a function of target total magnitude and Figure
17 shows the mean fraction of possible AGES targets that received a valid redshift as a function of the number of
nearby neighbor galaxies
We would have preferred to dene the ber completeness more locally eg count neighbors and nd the fraction
that got observed as this would tie the incompleteness closer to the large-scale structure This does not work because
some rather isolated targets failed to get bers generally due to high over density elsewhere in the eld and so we
are left with unobserved galaxies with undened weights This is only a problem in the less complete elds 13-15
For redshift completeness we are primarily concerned about trends with surface brightness There are 274 primary
galaxy targets 21 that received a ber but failed to get a redshift of course there are many more failed observations
but we reobserved most of them in order to get a useful redshift We track the surface brightness by the I-band 1cid48cid48
aperture magnitude In order to explore the redshift rate success we apply three criteria to our sample
1 Objects faintward of the main surface brightness locus as dened by I1cid48cid48
2 Objects whose colors suggest high redshift R  I  02BW  R  055 or not
3 Objects that were sparse sampled
0  08Itot  7 or not
Based on an object passing or failing each of these criteria we derive 8 sets of objects In each set we bin the galaxies
in 05 mag bins in aperture magnitude and consider the rate of getting a successful redshift among the targets that
received a ber Figure 18 shows the redshift completeness derived using this method as a function of the aperture
magnitude of each AGES galaxy target It is worth noting that we have not explicitly considered the signal-to-noise
ratio of the observations in this spectral completeness model In practice some observations were better than others
and this would alter the angular structure of the corrections but we believe this to be a minor eect
Our nal galaxy weight is calculating by multiplying the inverse of the sparse sampling rate the ber completeness
and the redshift completeness Figure 19 illustrates the distribution of spectroscopic weight the product of the
ber weight and redshift completeness weight for the full galaxy sample as well as the red and blue galaxy samples
Cool et al
Fig 16 Final AGES ber completeness as a function of total I-band magnitude This value represents the correction applied to each
galaxy due to observed objects which did not receive a ber due to ber collisions as described in A2
separately We have corrected for the photometric incompleteness by correcting the eective survey area as described
In total the main galaxy sample after sparse sampling area restrictions and applying a Itot  204 ux
limit has 12473 objects with good redshifts Summing the weights yields 25972 eective objects This is in good
agreement 03 with the 26033 targets in the parent Itot  204 sample after requiring good photometry in BW 
R and I and excluding bright stars from SDSS These numbers do not match exactly because the sparse sampling
was random and because of small unmodeled interactions between the various terms of the selection function eg
the ber incompleteness diers slightly from one class of sparse-sampling to the next but we have assumed the two
independent when we multiply the corrections The redshift distribution of AGES galaxies is shown in Figure 1
In summary AGES successfully observed half of the total Itot  204 photometric sample in the Bootes eld Nearly
all of this was due to the a priori sparse sampling which can be corrected exactly The ber incompleteness is 43 on
average the redshift incompleteness is 21 Given the very high completeness we are condent that the rst-order
attempts described above to correct the lingering incompleteness reduce the completeness uncertainties to well below
the statistical uncertainties

AGES Galaxy Luminosity Function
Fig 17 Fraction of AGES targets which received redshifts as a function of the number of neighbor galaxies within 30 of the
targets location The histogram right axis shows the distribution of neighbor counts for all of the AGES targets When calculating the
completeness correction for each galaxy in our survey we include the eects of neighboring galaxies as described in the text
Cool et al
Fig 18 Redshift completeness as a function of I-band aperture magnitude measuring the ux contained within a Hectospec ber
When calculating this completeness we consider objects based on three criteria with limits described in the text First we separate galaxies
based on their observed colors to separate galaxies with high- and low-redshift colors We secondly divide the sample based on the surface
brightness of each galaxy Finally we calculate the completeness separately for galaxies which were sparse sampled and those that were
not This separation gives rise to each of the 8 panels in the Figure The subdivision of each sample is listed in the lower-left and the mean
trend is showed by the diamonds with errorbars illustrating the 1- range in values When calculating the luminosity function we utilize
the raw completeness values in the gure the means are shown to guide the eye
