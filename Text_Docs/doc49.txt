Cooperative interactions among sensory receptors provide a general mechanism to increase the
sensitivity of signal transduction In particular bacterial chemotaxis receptors interact cooperatively
to produce an ultrasensitive response to chemoeector concentrations However cooperativity be-
tween receptors in large macromolecular complexes is necessarily based on local interactions and
consequently is fundamentally connected to slowing of receptor conformational dynamics which
increases intrinsic noise Therefore it is not clear whether or under what conditions cooperativ-
ity actually increases the precision of the concentration measurement We explictly calculate the
signal-to-noise ratio SNR for sensing a concentration change using a simple Ising-type model of
receptor-receptor interactions generalized via scaling arguments and nd that the optimal SNR is
always achieved by independent receptors
In biological networks cooperative interactions among
components can sharpen input-output relations increas-
ing gain and enabling switch-like responses The best-
known example is the cooperative bindingrelease of oxy-
gen by hemoglobin which enables ecient transport of
oxygen between the lungs and tissue
In sensory sys-
tems a well-studied example of cooperativity is receptor-
receptor coupling in Escherichia coli chemotaxis 1 For
sensing systems there is an obvious advantage of high
gain to amplify weak signals 2 particularly when com-
bined with an adaptation system to broaden the dynamic
range 3 This advantage of high gain from receptor-
receptor interactions raises the question why has recep-
tor coupling not evolved in other chemical sensing sys-
tems eg quorum sensing and eukaryotic chemotaxis
If the function of a sensory network is to reliably de-
tect weak signals then processing of the signal is only
half the story The other half is the suppression of
noise and for weak signals the signal-to-noise ratio SNR
generally governs information transmission and sensory
performance 4 Cellular signal transduction must con-
tend with both noisy inputs extrinsic noise as well as
the noise generated internally by the signal transduc-
tion system itself intrinsic noise While the presence
of signaling noise is well appreciated the connection be-
tween cooperativity and noise has received less atten-
tion 5 6 As we will show receptor cooperativity and
intrinsic signaling noise are inextricably linked via the
statistical mechanics of receptors The same cooperative
interactions that give rise to enhanced sensitivity nec-
essarily both amplify uctuations and slow the rate of
receptor-conformational switching limiting both the re-
sponse time and the ability of the system to reduce intrin-
sic noise by time-averaging Due to these tradeos it is
unclear when or whether receptor cooperativity actually
increases sensory performance
The prevailing view of bacterial chemoreceptor opera-
tion is that signal amplication from receptor coopera-
tivity enables the chemotaxis network to reliably detect
shallow gradients with exquisite sensitivity In this Let-
ter we challenge this viewpoint by evaluating the strat-
egy of using receptor cooperativity to enhance weak sig-
nal detection in light of the tradeos between gain and
intrinsic noise Specically we calculate the SNR for a
simple physical model of receptor-receptor interactions a
dynamical Ising-type model in which receptors have two
conformational states active and inactive and neighbor-
ing receptors prefer to be in the same conformational
state aka conformational spread 2 The input to
the network is the changing external ligand concentra-
tion and the output is the time-averaged total receptor
activity This two-state model is a good description of
bacterial chemoreceptors in which the active and inac-
tive conformational states are named for their relative
abilities to activate a downstream kinase 7 and the out-
put of the network is the CheY-P concentration which is
eectively the time-average of receptor activity over the
phosphorylated lifetime of individual CheY-P molecules
Importantly our model is the rst to both i incorpo-
rate the dynamics of receptor switching which is key to
understanding the reduction in noise by time-averaging
and ii base cooperativity on local interactions Unlike
the dynamic MWC models used in previous work 6 we
invoke no unphysical action-at-a-distance that allows the
entire receptor cluster to ip conformational states si-
multaneously In fact a recent study has provided direct
evidence for local interactions underlying the ultrasensi-
tive behavior of the bacterial motor 8
We consider a cell with a total of N two-state receptors
which are divided into m independent 1D chains each
of length n with nearest-neighbor Ising couplings inside
each chain given by the Hamiltonian
H  J Xhiji

where i  1 represents the activeinactive receptor
states hi ji denotes nearest neighbors and
f    logcid18 1  LK o

is the free-energy dierence between active and inactive
states which is a function of the ligand concentration
L ligand dissociation constants K o and K on and the
oset energy   Eon  Eo which is the energy dif-
ference between active and inactive states in the absence
of ligand 9 10 11
When ligand bindingunbinding is much faster than re-
ceptor conformational switching the stochastic dynamics
of switching is governed by a kinetic Ising model where
the occupation probablity p1    n t obeys the mas-
ter equation

For the case of slow ligand dynamics see 4 We as-
sume the switching rates k obey detailed balance and are
local ie depend only on the conformational states of the
receptor and its nearest neighbors Although the form of
this dependence has not been measured experimentally
a simple physically reasonable choice is Glauber dynam-
ics 12 which models interactions of the receptor system
with a heat bath With this choice

We let the model system respond to a small step in
ligand concentration and associated step change in free
energy f   log L over a given period of measure-
ment which we call avg We dene the average activity
of a receptor to be the probability the receptor is in the
active state with the total activity A being the sum of
the individual receptor activities The output of the sys-
tem is the time-averaged change in total activity 14

tive states is zero prior to stimulation ie the system is

The sensitivity to signal is quantied by the static re-
0 tdt which when normalized by
chain length is the factor by which the DC ie innite
time response of a coupled receptor is amplied rela-
tive to that of an uncoupled receptor The normalized
static response Rn increases as a function of cou-
pling strength from 1 to n as shown in Fig 1B At zero
coupling J  0 each receptor behaves independently
and there is no cooperative amplication of the signal
As the coupling is increased domains of adjacent recep-
tors begin to eectively switch conformations together
and the amplication Rn is determined by the size
of these domains
In practice many cells have a limited measurement
period and this can decrease the response Ravg as
shown in Fig 1C For a 1D ring this dependence takes
the simple form

is the response time which increases exponentially with
coupling strength due to the well-known phenomenon of
critical slowing down 15 Notice that for any nite av-
eraging time the response eventually falls to zero with
increasing coupling strength because the system slows
down and cannot respond to the input in the time avail-
able Intuitively for large coupling J the receptors be-
come frozen in an all-active or all-inactive state with
switching between these states too slow to mediate a
timely response to a changing input
The intrinsic noise ie the variance in time-averaged
activity increases monotonically with coupling strength

where c is given in Eq 8 and

 but time-averaging becomes less eective
with increasing J due again to critical slowing down as
the slower dynamics increases the correlation time c the
time required for uctuations in activity to decay
The relative uncertainty in sensing the concentration of

Surprisingly the optimal value of the coupling strength
J to maximize the SNR is zero for all averaging times
That is on a per receptor basis independent receptors
always have a lower total SNR than cooperative teams
of receptors For short averaging times independent re-
ceptors have both a larger response and lower noise than
teams For longer averaging times cooperative teams
have a larger response but independent receptors still
achieve a higher SNR because their rapid switching leads
to more independent samples of receptor activity and
thus to a much lower time-averaged noise
While the results in Fig 1C-E are shown only for
n  10 scaling analysis indicates that increasing the
chain length n will never make cooperative teams favor-
able with respect to uncoupled receptors In the follow-
ing we derive how the SNR scales with the only two
length scales in our model the chain length n and the
correlation length  which is the length scale over which
the conformational states of neighboring receptors are
correlated in an innite system
To best realize the cooperativity of a 1D chain of
length n the coupling strength has to be set to J 
smallest J that gives approximately maximal response
R  n2 and the averaging time has to be just
long enough for Ravg to approach this maximum ie

Thus the SNR for the cooperative team is approximately

Therefore
for cooperative teams to be favorable
with respect to uncoupled receptors requires J 
2 cJ 
n according to Eqs 12 and 13 However this
will never happen for 1D chains because the correlation
time grows faster than the correlation length with in-
creasing J in 1D specically c  2 In Fig 2 we plot
the ratio of SNRs for independent receptors versus co-
operative receptors for closed chains The ratio never
favors cooperative receptors and in the long-averaging-
time limit follows the expected scaling   for   n
and  2 for   n A shorter averaging time only
makes things worse for cooperative receptors as in this
case the expected scaling is still   for   n but  4
for   n 4

acting membrane receptors the ratio of uncoupled to

pendent receptors achieve SNR  1 for the fewest recep-
tors and ii for a given number of receptors indepen-
dent receptors achieve SNR  1 for the smallest stimulus
strength
Our surprising result oers a fresh perspective on bac-
terial chemotaxis by indicating that the network is not
simply optimizing SNR since the observed receptor co-
operativity in this system reduces the SNR by a factor
of  50 18 More generally our result reveals that the
benets of cooperativity for sensing are far from obvious
potentially explaining the absence of receptor coopera-
tivity in many sensory networks

High dimensional D  4 or global coupling of recep-
tors which could be mediated by the cell membrane or
by rapidly diusing eectors is described by the mean
eld limit of the Ising model In this limit the dynam-
ics of cluster activity reduces to that of an overdamped
harmonic oscillator and the normalized static response
and correlation time are both equal RMFTn

 11  J where  is the number of nearest
neighbors Consequently for long averaging times the
ratio of SNRs for independent versus coupled receptors
is constant Thus at best increasing the dimension of
receptor coupling yields parity between cooperative and
independent receptors
More generally the universal behavior of Ising mod-
els near the phase transition and a rigorous bound on
Ising critical exponents z   17 suggest that critical
slowing down is unavoidable and independent receptors
will always optimize the SNR We have also studied the
addition of other potential noise sources including slow
ligand dynamics and static variation of receptor oset
energies and nd that independent receptors still yield
the best SNR 4
In summary we developed a physical description of
cooperativity based on the principle that allosteric in-
teractions between receptor proteins are inherently local
From our simple Ising-type model which encompasses a
broad class of models we elucidated the relationship be-
tween cooperativity and intrinsic noise We found that
the slowing down of receptor switching due to coopera-
tive interactions strongly impairs the SNR and that con-
sequently the SNR is always highest for z ero receptor
cooperativity even though the absolute sensitivity is op-
timized for nonzero cooperativity Since our SNR is nor-
malized by receptor number and stimulus strength our
results show that i for a given small stimulus inde-

As such a large free-energy dierence can make the rate
of switching from a low-energy state to a high-energy
state arbitrarily small but the reverse transition can only
approach the maximal rate
