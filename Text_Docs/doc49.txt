Abstract
In the present article we study the Hawking radiation HR of spin1 particles  so-called
vector particles  from a three dimensional 3D rotating black hole with scalar hair RBHWSH
using Hamilton-Jacobi HJ ansatz Putting the Proca equation amalgamated with the WKB
approximation in process the tunneling spectrum of vector particles is obtained We recover the
standard Hawking temperature corresponding to the emission of these particles from RBHWSH
INTRODUCTION
One of the most radical predictions of general relativity GR is the existence of black
holes BHs According to the seminal works of Hawking 13 BHs are not entirely black
That was the surprising claim made by Hawking over forty years ago Examining the behav-
ior of quantum uctuations around the event horizon of a BH Hawking substantiated the
theory that BHs radiate thermal radiation with a constant temperature  so-called Hawk-
ing temperature  directly proportional to the surface gravity  which is the gravitational
acceleration experienced at the BHs horizon
with the system of units c  G  kB  1 The works of Hawking and Bekenstein 4  and
of others 515 rederiving TH in various ways  brings together the normally disparate areas
of GR quantum mechanics QM and thermodynamics Enthusiasm for understanding of
the underlying coordinations between these subjects of physics creates ample motivation for
the study of HR see for instance 1627 and references therein
Quantum uctuations create a virtual particle pair near the BH horizon  While the
particle with negative energy tunnels into the horizon absorption the other one having
positive energy ies o into spatial innity emission and produces the HR Applying the
WKB approximation the emission and absorption probabilities of the tunneling particles
give the tunneling rate  as 12 28 29

where S is the action of the classically forbidden trajectory of the tunneling particle which
has a net energy Enet and temperature T  One of the methods for nding S is to use the HJ
method This method is generally performed by substituting a suitable ansatz considering
the symmetries of the spacetime into the relativistic HJ equation The resulting radial
integral always possesses a pole located at the event horizon However using the residue
theory the associated pole can be analytically evaded 30
Recently within the framework of the HJ method the HR of spin1 particles described
by the Proca equation in 3D non-rotating static BHs has been studied by Kruglov 28
These spin1 particles are in fact the vector particles like Z and W  bosons and they
have signicant role in the Standard Model 31 Based on Kruglovs study 28 Chen et al
32 have very recently investigated the HR of these bosons in the rotating BTZ geometry
Similar to the works of 28 32 here we aim to study the HR of the vector particles in the
3D RBHWSH 3336 These BHs are solutions to the action in 3D Einstein gravity that is
non-minimally coupled to scalar eld  In the limit of   0 RBHWSH is nothing but the
rotating BTZ BH 33 37
This paper is organized as follows Sec 2 introduces the geometrical and thermodynam-
ical features of the 3D RBHWSH spacetime In Sec 3 we study the Proca equation for
a massive boson in this geometry Then we employ the HJ method with the separation
of variables technique to obtain the HR of the RBHWSH Finally in Sec4 we present our
remarks

where the coupling strength  between gravity and the scalar eld is 18 Furthermore
the scalar potential V  is given by

in which the parameters  B and a are integration constants and  is the cosmological

It is worth noting that RBHWSH can be reduced to the rotating BTZ BH solution when
B  0 3336 Following 35 36 one can see that the mass the Hawking temperature

this BH are given by

out analysis into nding r values we impose the condition of f r  0 which yields a
particular cubic equation The solutions of that cubic equation are also given in detail by

III HR OF SPIN-1 PARTICLES FROM RBHWSH
As described by Kruglov 28 the Proca equation for the massive vector particles having
the wave function  is given by
g

Let us set the vector function as
    
  c0 c1 c2 expcid20 i
St r cid21 
and assume that the action is given by
St r   S0t r   S1t r   2S2t r   
According to the WKB approximation we can further set
S0t r   Et  Lr  j  k
where E and j are the energy and angular momentum of the spin-1 particles respectively
and k is a complex constant Substituting Eqs 15 16 17 and 18 into Eq 14 and
considering the leading order in  we obtain a 3  3 matrix let us say  matrix equation
 c1 c2 c3T  0 the superscript T means the transition to the transposed vector Thus
one can read the non-zero components of  as follows

r2 cid2f r  r2r2cid3  E 2

A2  r2f r E  jr 
Upon the fact that any homogeneous system of linear equations 19 admits nontrivial
solution if and only if det  0 we obtain
det 
r6 A1  j 2 
Solving for Lr yields
r2f r3 2  0
Lr  Z sE  rj2  f rm2  j 2
One can immediately observe from the above that when r  0 it reduces to the Kruglovs
solution 28 The L corresponds to outgoing moving away from the BH spin-1 particles
and L stands for the ingoing moving towards the BH spin-1 particles The imaginary
part of Lr can be calculated by using the pole deployed at the horizon According to the
complex path integration method via the Feynmans prescription 30  see 12 for a similar
process we have
ImLr

Therefore the probabilities of the vector particles crossing the horizon outin become

According to the classical denition of the BH any outside particle certainly falls into
the BH So we must have Pabsorption  1 which results in Imk  ImL On the other
hand L  L so that the total probability of radiating particles as a consequence of

In this paper we have used the Proca equation to compute the tunneling rate of outgoing
vector particles across the event horizon of axially symmetric static rotating 3D RBHWSHs
For this purpose we have ignored the back-reaction eects and substituted the HJ ansatz
into the associated Proca equations
In the derivation of the tunneling rate within the
framework of the WKB approximation the calculation of the imaginary part of the action
was the most important point Using the complex path integration technique we have
shown that the tunneling rate is given by Eq 26 The latter result allowed us to recover
the standard Hawking temperature for RBHWSH
Finally a study about the vector particles in the higher dimensional BHs may reveal
more information compared to the present case This is going to be our next problem in the
near future
