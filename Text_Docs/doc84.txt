Abstract
It appears dicult to construct a simple model for an open universe based on the
one bubble inationary scenario The reason is that one needs a large mass to avoid
the tunneling via the Hawking Moss solution and a small mass for successful slow-
rolling However Rubakov and Sibiryakov suggest that the Hawking Moss solution
is not a solution for the false vacuum decay process since it does not satisfy the
boundary condition Hence we have reconsidered the arguments for the defect of the
simple polynomial model We nd the valley bounce belonging to a valley line in the
functional space represents the decay process instead of the Hawking Moss solution
The point is that the valley bounce gives the appropriate initial condition for the
ination We show an open ination model can be constructed within the polynomial
form of the potential so that the uctuations can be reconciled with the observations
Details of the analysis can be seen in Ref1
Introduction
Recent observations suggest the matter density of the universe is less than the critical density Hence
it is desirable to have a model for an open universe say 0  03 The realization of an open universe
is dicult in the ordinary inationary scenario This is because if the universe expands enough to solve
the horizon problem the universe becomes almost at One attempt to realize an open universe in the
inationary scenario is to consider inside the bubble created by the false vacuum decay 2 The scenario
is as follows Consider the potential which has two minimum One is the false vacuum which has non-
zero energy and the other is the true vacuum Initially the eld is trapped at the false vacuum Due
to the potential energy universe expands exponentially and the large fraction of the universe becomes
homogeneous As the false vacuum is unstable it decays and creates the bubble of the true vacuum If the
decay process is well suppressed the interior of the bubble is still homogeneous The decay is described
by the O4 symmetric conguration in the Euclidean spacetime Then analytical continuation of this
conguration to the Lorentzian spacetime describes the evolution of the bubble which looks from the
inside like an open universe Unfortunately since the bubble radius cannot be greater than the Hubble
radius the created universe is curvature dominated even if the whole energy of the false vacuum is
converted to the energy of the matter inside the bubble 3 Thus the second ination in the bubble is
needed If this second ination stopped when   1 our universe becomes homogeneous open universe
Though the basic idea is simple the realization of this scenario in a simple model has been recognized
dicult 4 The diculty is usually explained as follows Consider the model involving one scalar eld
For the polynomial form of the potential like V   m22  3  4 the tunneling should occur at
suciently large  to ensure that the second ination gives the appropriate density parameter Then

the curvature around the barrier which separates the false and the true vacuum is small compared with
the Hubble scale which is determined by the energy of the false vacuum In this case the eld jumps up
onto the top of the barrier due to the quantum diusion When the eld begins to roll down from the top
of the barrier large uctuations are formed due to the quantum diusion at the top of the barrier Then
the whole scenario fails This problem is rather generic To avoid jumping up the curvature around the
barrier should be large compared with the Hubble scale V   H 2 On the other hand to realize the
second ination the eld should roll down slowly then we need V   H 2 These two conditions are
incompatible
There are several attempts to overcome this problem Recently Linde constructs the potential which
has sharp peak near the false vacuum 5 In this potential the tunneling occurs and at the same time
slow-rolling is allowed after tunneling then the second ination can be realized But it is still unclear
what is the physical mechanism for the appearance of the sharp peak in the potential
We will reconsider this problem from dierent perspective The point is the understanding of the
tunneling process In the imaginary-time path-integral formalism tunneling is described by the solution
of the Euclidean eld equation This solution gives the saddle-point of the path-integral Then this
determines the semi-classical exponent of the decay rate expSEB where SE is the Euclidean
action In the case the curvature around the barrier is small compared with the Hubble the solution
is given by the Hawking Moss HM solution which stays at the top of the barrier through the whole
Euclidean time 6 Recently Rubakov and Sibiryakov give the interpretation of this tunneling mode
using the constrained instanton method 7 8 They show the HM solution does not represent the false
vacuum decay if one takes into account the analytic continuation to the Lorentzian spacetime This is
because this solution does not satisfy the boundary condition that the eld exists in the false vacuum at
the innite past However this does not imply the decay does not occur One should consider a family
of the almost saddle-point congurations instead of the true solution of the Euclidean eld equation
They show although the decay rate is determined by the HM solution the structure of the eld after
tunneling is determined by the other conguration which is one of the almost saddle-point solutions In
this method one must choose the constraint so that a family of almost saddle-point solutions well covers
the region which is expected to dominate the path-integral One way to realize this is to cover the valley
region of the functional space of the action 9 10 Along the valley line the action varies most gently
Then it is reasonable to take the congurations on the valley line as a family of the almost saddle-point
congurations We will call the conguration on the valley line of the action the valley bounce V 
This analysis gives the possibility to overcome the problem Even if the curvature around the barrier
is small compared with the Hubble scale it implies there is a possibility to occur the tunneling described
by the valley bounce If the eld appears suciently far from the top one can avoid the large uctuations
During the tunneling uctuations of the tunneling eld are generated These uctuations are stretched
during the second ination and observed in the open universe These should be compatible with the
observation Once this can be conrmed there is no diculty in constructing the one bubble open
inationary model in the simple model with the polynomial form of the potential
In this paper we show this is true as long as the tunneling is described by the valley bounce We
clarify the structure of the valley bounce extending the method developed by Aoyamaetal 10 to the de
Sitter spacetime We show the uctuations can be reconciled with the observations
2 Valley method in de Sitter spacetime
First we review the formalisms which are necessary to describe the false vacuum decay in the de Sitter
space We want to examine the case in which the gravity comes to play a role Unfortunately we have
not known how to deal with quantum gravity eect yet So we study the case in which we can treat
gravity at the semi-classical level That is we treat the problem within the framework of the eld theory
in a xed curved spacetime 7 The potential relevant to the tunneling is given by
We assume  is of the order M 4
M M  M Then the geometry of the spacetime is xed to the de Sitter spacetime with H  M 2
 and VT  is of the order M 4 We study the case M is small compared to
 Mp
V     VT 
where M 2
p  8G3 We consider the situation in which the potential VT  has the false vacuum at
  F and the top of the barrier at   T  Since the background metric is xed we can change the
origin of the energy freely We choose VT F   0 Following we work in units with H  1
The decay rate is given by the imaginary part of the path-integral
Z  Z d exp SE
where SE is the Euclidean action relevant to the tunneling The dominant contribution of this path-
integral is given by the congurations which have O4 symmetry 11 So we assume the background
metric and the eld to have the form
ds2  d2  a2cid0d2  sin2 dcid1 
  
where a  sin  Then the Euclidean action of  is given by
SE  22Z dcid18a3cid18 1
2  VT cid19cid19 
The saddle-point of this path-integral is determined by the Euclidean eld equation SE0
We impose the regularity conditions at the time when a  0 as
  3 cot    V 
T   0
  0      0
If the uctuations around this solution have a
We represent the solution of this equation as B
negative mode this gives the imaginary part to the path-integral and this solution contributes to the
decay dominantly The decay rate  is evaluated by
  expSEB
The equation has two types of the solutions depending on the shape of the potential If the curvature
around the barrier is large compared with the Hubble scale then the Coleman De Luccia CD solution
and the Hawking Moss HM solution exist 6 11
In this case the decay is described by the CD
solution The analytic continuation of this solution to Lorentzian spacetime describes the bubble of the
true vacuum On the other hand in the case the curvature around the barrier is small compared with
the Hubble scale only the HM solution exists This solution is a trivial solution   T  The meaning of
the HM solution is somewhat ambiguous There are several attempts to interpret this tunneling mode
One way is to use the stochastic approach 12 Within this approach it has been demonstrated that the
decay rate given by eq7 coincides with the probability of jumping from the false vacuum F onto the
top of the barrier T due to the quantum uctuations
Recently Rubakov and Sibiryakov give the interpretation of the HM solution using the constrained
instanton method 7 8 The main idea is to consider a family of the almost saddle-point congurations
instead of the true solution of the Euclidean eld equation ie the HM solution The motivation comes
from the boundary condition They take the boundary condition that the state of the quantum uctua-
tions above the classical false vacuum is the conformal vacuum In this case they show the eld should
not be constant at 0     and the HM solution is excluded by this boundary condition Then one
should seek the other congurations which obey the boundary condition and dominantly contribute to the
path-integral In the functional integral the saddle-point solution gives the most dominant contribution
but the contribution from a family of almost saddle-point congurations which have almost the same
action with that of the saddle-point solution should also be included To realize this in the functional
integral one introduces the identity 1  R dC   into the path integral for some constraint C First
choose one  This selects the subspace of the functional space In this subspace we can perform the
integral of the eld using saddle-point method under the constraint The minimum in this subspace
satises the equation of motion with constraint instead of the eld equation This minimum corresponds
to the almost saddle-point conguration  which is slightly deformed from the HM solution Changing
 these congurations form a trajectory We can evaluate the path-integral by integrating over  along
this trajectory Since along this trajectory the HM solution gives the minimum action integrating over
 gives the decay rate determined by the HM solution But the structure of the eld after tunneling can
be determined by the other conguration on this trajectory  They found the conguration which de-
scribes the bubble of the true vacuum if we continue it to the Lorentzian spacetime Then they conclude
that even in the case only the HM solution exists the result of the tunneling process can be the bubble
of the true vacuum which is described by one of the almost saddle-point congurations
In this formalism the validity of the method depends on the choice of the constraint 10 13 This is
because in practice we do the Gaussian integral around the almost saddle-point solutions To evaluate
the path-integral properly we should choose the constraint so that a family of almost saddle-point solutions
well covers the region which is expected to dominate the path-integral Since the action varies most gently
along the valley line one way to realize the aim is to cover the valley region of the action 9 10 One can
identify the congurations on the valley line and make Gaussian integral around these congurations
Taking into account the above fact it is desirable to analyze the structure of not only the solution
of the Euclidean eld equation but also the congurations on the valley line One way to dene the
congurations on this valley line is to use the valley method developed by Aoyamaetal 10 To obtain
the intuitive understanding of this method consider the system of the eld i Here i stands for the
discretized coordinate label and we take the metric as ij
In the valley method the equation which
identies the valley line in the functional space is given by
DijiS   iS Dij  ijS
where i  i Since this equation has one parameter  this denes a trajectory in the space of 
The parameter  is one of the eigen value of the matrix Dij On this trajectory the gradient vector iS
is orthogonal to all the eigenvectors of Dij except for the eigenvector of the eigen value  This equation
can be rewritten as
icid18 1
jS2  Scid19  0
This allows the interpretation of the solution for the equation It extremizes the norm of the gradient
vector iS under the constraint S const where  plays the role of the Lagrange multiplier Such
solution can be found each hypersurface of constant action then the solutions of the equation form a
line in the functional space If we take  as the one with the smallest value then the gradient vector is
minimized In this case the action varies most gently along this line This is a plausible denition of the
valley line We will call the conguration on the valley line of the action the valley bounce V and the
trajectory they form the valley trajectory
Following we formulate this method in the de Sitter spacetime The most convenient way is to use
the variational method eq9 We shall dene the valley action by
SV  SE

The valley bounce is obtained by varying this action The equation which determines the valley bounce
SV   0 is a fourth order dierential equation We introduce the auxiliary eld f to cancel the fourth
derivative term 14
Then the valley action becomes

Using a  sin  the valley equation which determines the structure of the valley bounce is given by

We analyze the structure of the valley bounce for the case only the HM solution exists We construct
the piece-wise quadratic potential in which we can solve the valley equations analytically The potential
which we study is

where  is of the order M 4 For m2
T  4 only the HM solution exists For example we take m2
F  05 and   01M 4 The HM solution has one negative eigenvalue HM  2 and the smallest
positive eigenvalue is given by HM  2 The generic feature of the valley bounce is understood by the
simple analysis of the case in which the valley bounce exists only in one parabola First consider the valley
trajectory associated with the negative eigenvalue The solution of the valley equation is essentially has
a form f    T   const This solution does not represent the tunneling so we seek the trajectory
associated with the smallest positive eigenvalue HM   HM The solution of the valley equation is
given by T  cos  and f  T  Fig1 In this trajectory the HM solution gives the minimum
of the action Fig2 The horizontal coordinate is the norm of the led   qR da3  T2
The action grows as the variation of the eld becomes large but this increase is relatively gentle
Although the HM solution gives the dominant contribution to the path-integral this solution does
not satisfy the boundary condition for the false vacuum decay as shown by Rubakov and Sibiryakov 7
Making Analytic continuation to the Lorentzian spacetime at   0z  1 the eld moves according
to the eld equation
If the eld reaches F  this solution represents the false vacuum decay The
behavior of the eld in this Lorentzian spacetime is determined by the initial position of the eld This
is determined by the behavior of the eld at   0 in the Euclidean region Provided that its initial
position is dierent from T  this boundary condition can be satised From this fact the HM solution
does not satisfy the boundary condition On the other hand the valley bounce does satisfy the boundary
condition Furthermore the uctuations around the valley bounce should have one negative mode to
ensure that the valley bounce plays a role instead of the HM solution The valley bounce has a lowest
eigenvalue V  V  We nd this is negative on this trajectory Since this is the unique negative
eigenvalue the gaussian integration of the uctuations around this valley bounce gives the imaginary
part to the path-integral Then the valley bounce contributes to the false vacuum decay and describes
the creation of the bubble of the true vacuum
3 An open universe from valley bounce
We will see an open ination model can be constructed using the valley bounce Following we restore
the Hubble scale H Since the radius of the bubble R is small compared with the Hubble horizon 11
then the curvature scale is greater than the energy of the matter inside the bubble M even if the whole
energy of the false vacuum is converted to it M M 2
p  H 2  1R2 3 Then we need the second
ination in the bubble To realize the second ination inside the bubble the eld should roll slowly down
the potential This implies the curvature of the potential is small compared with the Hubble To avoid
the ad hoc ne-tuning of the potential we will assume this is true for all region of the potential In this
case since mT  H the solution of the Euclidean equation is given by the HM solution and the valley
bounce is shown as in Fig7 We connect the linear potential at the point the eld appears after the
tunneling

We demand the potential and its derivative are connected smoothly at the connection point  Then
we obtain

The initial conditions of the eld are given by the valley bounce

If the eld obeys the classical eld equation
then the solution of  satises

In the small t this behaves as 143t The classical motion during one expansion time is given by
 H 1 On the other hand the amplitude of the quantum uctuations is given by   H The
curvature perturbation R produced by the quantum uctuations is approximately given by the ratio of
these two quantities

This should be of the order 105 from the observation of the cosmic microwave background CMB
anisotropies If   T  H as in the case the HM solution describes the tunneling R  1 and the
scenario cannot work well This is because at   T  the eld experiences the quantum diusion rather
than the classical potential force Fluctuations in this diusion dominated epoch make the inhomogeneous
delay of the start of the classical motion thus make large uctuations Fortunately from Fig7 we see
for appropriate  the valley bounce gives the initial condition as   T  O1M 2mT  which is
larger than the Hubble if M  H In this case the potential force works and the eld rolls slowly down
the potential We expect the curvature perturbation can be suppressed for the valley bounce In fact we
nd the power of the curvature purturbations is given by

This quantity should be of the order 1010 from the observation This can be achieved by taking

4 Conclusion
It is dicult to provide the model which solves the horizon problem and at the same time leads to
the open universe in the context of the usual inationary scenario In the one bubble open inationary
scenario the horizon problem is solved by the rst ination and the second ination creates the universe
with the appropriate 0
Many works have been done within this framework of the scenario and it is recognized this scenario
requires additional ne-tuning 4 5 The defect is thought to arise because the curvature around the
barrier should be larger than the Hubble scale to avoid large uctuations which contradicts to the
requirement that the curvature of the potential should be small to realize the second ination inside the
bubble
Thus to complete the scenario we should solve this problem The main claim of this paper is that this
problem can be solved in the simple model with the polynomial form of the potential We reconsidered
the tunneling process from the dierent perspective If the curvature around the potential is small the
tunneling is described by one of a family of the almost saddle-point solutions 7 This is because the true
saddle-point solution that is the Hawking Moss solution does not satisfy the boundary condition for
the false vacuum decay The main idea is that the almost saddle-point solution can give the appropriate
initial condition for the second ination A family of the almost saddle-point solutions generally forms
a valley line in the functional space We called the congurations on the valley line valley bounces To
identify valley bounces we applied the valley method developed by Aoyamaetal 10 In this method
these congurations can be identied using the fact the trajectory they form in the functional space
corresponds to the line on which the action varies most gently We formulated this method in the de
Sitter spacetime and claried the structure of the valley bounces We found the valley bounce which
gives the appropriate initial condition of the second ination even if the curvature around the barrier is
small compared with the Hubble scale Consider the case this valley bounce describes the tunneling It
is possible the eld appears suciently far from the top of the barrier after the tunneling then we can
avoid the large uctuations Hence using the valley bounce we can solve the problem which arises in
the open inationary scenario besides the usual ne-tuning of the inationary scenario The one bubble
open ination model can be constructed without diculty
