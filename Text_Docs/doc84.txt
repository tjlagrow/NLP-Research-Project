ABSTRACT
We describe a new estimate of the radio galaxy 14GHz luminosity function and its
evolution at intermediate redshifts z  04 Photometric redshifts and color selection
have been used to select BJ  235 early-type galaxies from the Panoramic Deep Fields
a multicolor survey of two 25 elds Approximately 230 radio galaxies have then
been selected by matching early-type galaxies with NVSS radio sources brighter than
5mJy Estimates of the 14GHz luminosity function of radio galaxies measure signicant
evolution over the observed redshift range For an M  1 cosmology the evolution of
the radio power is consistent with luminosity evolution where P z  P 01  zkL and
3  kL  5 The observed evolution is similar to that observed for U V X and X-ray
selected AGN and is consistent with the same physical process being responsible for the
optical and radio luminosity evolution of AGN

Introduction
Evolution of radio sources is required to explain the observed number of radio sources and the
redshift distribution of radio sources with observed optical counterparts Longair 1966 Condon

1984 Peacock 1985 Radio emission from high redshift AGN is detectable in wide-eld radio sky
surveys and the optical counterparts of some z  3 radio-loud QSOs can be detected on Schmidt
photographic plates However most radio-loud AGN are radio galaxies and at z  05 their faint
optical counterparts BJ  23 make it dicult to obtain the large spectroscopic samples required
to measure the evolution of the luminosity function
Several previous samples of radio galaxies with redshifts are summarized in Table 1 To date
most estimates of the radio galaxy luminosity function have relied on catalogues limited to bright
radio ux limits Kuehr et al 1981 Wall and Peacock 1985 Dunlop et al 1989 or bright optical
ux limits Condon 1989 Sadler et al 1989 Machalski and Condon 1999 These catalogues contain
relatively few radio galaxies as opposed to radio-loud QSOs at z  02 and consequently shed
little light on the radio galaxy luminosity function and its evolution at these redshifts Samples
that have attempted to extend our knowledge of the radio galaxy luminosity function at z  02 by
extending the identication of mJy radio sources to faint optical magnitudes B  22 have been
limited to relatively small samples of objects 10-60 galaxies due to the dicultly of obtaining
follow-up spectroscopy As a result estimates of the radio galaxy luminosity function and evolution
obtained from these samples are still subject to signicant uncertainty
With photometric redshifts and color selection it is possible select and estimate the redshifts of
faint early-type galaxies in multicolor imaging surveys Brown et al 2000 By matching early-type
galaxies with sources from the radio catalogues it is possible to compile a large uniformly selected
catalogue of radio galaxies to measure the evolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function As
the radio galaxies are selected from deep wide-eld imaging data a large catalogue of radio-quiet
galaxies is also available to measure the environments of the radio galaxies Brown et al 2001
2 The Panoramic Deep Fields
The Panoramic Deep Fields Brown 2000 are 5  5 images of the South Galactic Pole SGP
and UK Schmidt eld 855 F855 The images were produced by stacking SuperCOSMOS scans
of UK Schmidt photographic plates in U  BJ  R and I bands Object detection instrumental
photometry and faint object star-galaxy classications were determined with SExtractor Bertin
and Arnouts 1996 Photometric calibration of the data was determined with CCD images and
published photometry with corrections for dust extinction being derived from the dust maps of
Schlegel et al 1998 The nal galaxy catalogues are complete to BJ  235 and R  22 Brown
2000 provides a detailed description of the data reduction and calibration of the Panoramic Deep
Fields
Photometric redshifts were calibrated using the polynomial tting method of Connolly et al
1995 and  700 Panoramic Deep Field galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts available from the
NED database Brown et al 2000 Comparison of the photometric redshifts of radio galaxies with
spectroscopic redshifts showed that radio galaxy redshifts were systematically underestimated by
 3 
 15 This is almost certainly due to radio galaxies being more luminous and having slightly
bluer colors than other early-type galaxies Sadler et al 1989 Govoni et al 2000 To correct for
this the photometric redshifts of radio galaxies in this paper were increased by 15 and Figure 2
shows there is good agreement between the corrected photometric and spectroscopic redshifts
3 Selection of Radio Galaxies
The radio galaxy sample consists of Panoramic Deep Field galaxies which are associated with
objects in the NVSS source catalogue Condon et al 1998 BJ  R color and photometric redshifts
were used to select BJ  235 galaxies which are redder than a non-evolving Sbc where the Sbc
colors were determined with the kcorrections of Coleman et al 1980 The optical galaxies were
then matched to radio sources from the NVSS source catalog The selection of early-type galaxies
removes contamination of the radio galaxy sample by QSOs and starbursts
If unied models
of radio-loud AGN Barthel 1989 are valid the removal of QSOs from the sample removed radio
galaxies viewed at certain orientations However as the galaxy photometric redshifts are not usable
for QSOs the removal of QSOs from the sample allowed the measurement of radio galaxy evolution
without spectroscopic redshifts
As the evolution of the radio galaxy population was studied the criterion used for matching
radio and optical sources could not be a function of redshift High completeness was also required to
prevent the estimate of the luminosity function being dominated by corrections for incompleteness
Low contamination of the sample was required so estimates of the luminosity function and radio
galaxy environments would not be dominated by galaxies not associated with radio sources
The brightest NVSS source catalogue positions have 1 error estimates of  1 while the
faintest  25mJy source positions have errors of  10 Condon et al 1998 The sky surface
density of BJ  235 galaxies which meet the color selection selection criterion is  05 so  40
of  25mJy sources have an unassociated optical galaxy within 3 of the radio source position To
prevent the catalogue being dominated by spurious matches to faint radio sources the radio ux
limit was set to 5mJy which is slightly brighter than completeness limit of the NVSS catalogue
The Panoramic Deep Fields contain  9  104 early-type galaxies and  104 radio sources
making the manual selection of radio galaxies prohibitively time consuming An obvious auto-
mated criterion for selecting optical counterparts to radio sources is to match objects within  3
of the radio source centroid However as many extragalactic radio sources have extended emission
this will be incomplete for a signicant fraction of radio sources Selection criterion using only the
angular separation between radio and optical sources can select a large fraction of all radio sources
However for a xed angular scale the projected distance increases with redshift introducing selec-
tion eects which are a function of redshift Large radio sources will be excluded at low redshift
but will be included at high redshift where the angular size of the radio sources is less than the
selection criterion
 4 
As the optical counterparts of radio sources are physical associations a selection criterion based
on the physical separation of the optical and radio sources can be used to select radio galaxies
While the NVSS catalogue does not contain redshift information photometric redshifts can be
used to estimate the redshifts of optical galaxies and the projected distance between the optical
and radio sources As the size in physical coordinates of radio sources does not rapidly evolve
between z  1 and z  0 Buchalter et al 1998 a selection criterion using a xed projected
distance should not introduce selection eects which are a function of redshift
To determine the projected distance used as the selection criterion for optical counterparts
the distribution of projected distances between NVSS sources and optical galaxies within 30 of
NVSS sources was measured and is plotted in Figure 1 The number of optical counterparts declines
rapidly on scales  20h1kpc h  100kms1Mpc1  H0 after which the distribution has a long
tail Approximately 25 of the NVSS sources with early-type galaxies within 30 have more than
one early-type counterpart which is consistent with much of the tail in Figure 1 being contamination
To reduce the contamination optical galaxies  20h1kpc from NVSS sources were excluded from
the radio galaxy sample A complete list of the radio galaxy sample is provided in Table 2
The completeness of the selection criterion was estimated by applying the 20h1kpc criterion
to radio galaxies from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey identied by Machalski and Condon
1999 Approximately 85 of radio galaxies identied by Machalski and Condon 1999 were
selected with the 20h1kpc criterion Fluxes in the NVSS source catalogue are estimated by tting
elliptical Gaussians to the radio emission and for  5 of radio galaxies where the ts are poor the
uxes disagree with Machalski and Condon 1999 by  5 At z  005 an increasing fraction
of radio galaxies have radio emission resolved into multiple components by the NVSS resulting in
 50 of radio galaxies having source catalogue ux estimates which disagree with Machalski and
Condon 1999
While contamination is low with the 20h1kpc selection criterion it is still present in the radio
galaxy catalogue To prevent these objects from biasing the estimate of the luminosity function
a control sample was constructed by randomly repositioning the radio sources and matching them
to the galaxy catalogue This process was repeated 10 times so the control sample size was large
enough to not be a signicant source of noise in the estimate of the luminosity function
Approximately 2 of radio sources with optical counterparts have 2 optical counterparts re-
sulting in ambiguous redshift estimates As this is a small fraction of the total catalogue rejecting
these objects from the radio galaxy and control samples only reduced the completeness of the sam-
ple by 4 and did not signicantly bias estimates of the evolution of radio galaxies The estimates
of the space density and luminosity function parameters were renormalized to account for the 2
of radio galaxies removed from the catalogue The nal catalogue of radio galaxies contains 230
objects while the control sample generated with 10 times as many radio sources contains 229
objects

4 Redshift Distribution
The BJ and R Hubble diagrams for the optical counterparts of NVSS sources are shown in
Figure 3 There is a strong correlation between redshift and magnitude though this is partially due
to the use of photometric redshifts which result in objects with the same multicolor photometry
having the same redshift estimate The R band Hubble diagram shows evidence of incompleteness
at z  055 due to the BJ magnitude limit As the apparent magnitude of a MBJ
 20 elliptical at
z  055 is BJ  23 this is not unexpected As the incompleteness at z  055 could signicantly
bias estimates of radio galaxy evolution the sample was limited to redshifts z  055 At low
redshifts the errors of the photometric redshifts are comparable to the redshift estimates resulting
in large errors for the estimates of the radio power To prevent these objects from introducing errors
into the estimate of the luminosity function only the 196 radio galaxies with 010  z  055 were
used to estimate the luminosity function The redshift distributions of the radio galaxy sample
the Parkes selected regionsDunlop et al 1989 and PhoenixHopkins et al 1998 are shown in
Figure 4 The size of the Panoramic Deep Fields results in an improved estimate of the radio
galaxy luminosity function at z  04 and the broad redshift distribution has allowed the evolution
of z  055 radio galaxies to be measured
5 Color Distribution
The color selection criterion applied to the radio galaxy candidates will aect the sample
completeness at some level If a large fraction of radio galaxies have colors bluer than the selection
criterion signicant uncertainty is introduced into estimates of the luminosity function and its
evolution The colors of galaxies in the radio galaxy sample are shown as a function of redshift in
Figure 5 While most radio galaxies have red colors some do have colors similar to the selection
criterion However this could be due to contamination which is comprised mostly of blue galaxies
which dominate the faint galaxy population
The estimated restframe colors of the radio galaxy sample are plotted in Figure 6 Restframe
colors were estimated with linear extrapolations from the E and Sbc kcorrections from Coleman
et al 1980 The peak of the distribution is  02 magnitudes redder than the BJ  R  101
selection criterion For comparison the distribution of radio galaxy colors from Govoni et al 2000
is also shown If Govoni et al 2000 sample is representative of all radio galaxies then  85 of
radio galaxies were selected by the color selection criterion However the distributions in Figure 6
are not identical and a systematic BJ  R  01 dierence between the Govoni et al 2000
and Panoramic Deep Field colors could alter the completeness by  10 For the remainder of the
paper the incompleteness due to the color selection criterion is assumed to be 15

6 The 14 GHz Luminosity Function
The restframe radio power of the sources was estimated with
logP14WHz1  logS14mJy  1  rlog1  z  2logDlMpc  17185
where S14 is the observed 14GHz radio ux Dl is the luminosity distance and r is the radio
spectral index which is assumed to be 07 The radio luminosity function was estimated with
P14 Xi
Schmidt 1968 where Vmaxi is the maximum comoving volume in which the ith source would be
included in the sample The value of Vmaxi is given by
Vmaxi  i
H0 Z zmax
where  is the survey area i is the completeness of the survey for sources with the properties of
source i zmin and zmax are the minimum and maximum redshifts where source i would be included
in the sample and Vc is the comoving volume The values of zmin and zmax were set by the bright
and faint ux limits optical and radio for the sample and the lower and upper limits for the
redshifts over which the luminosity function is determined
The radio luminosity function of radio galaxies for 010  z  030 and 030  z  055 is
shown in Figure 7 and listed in Table 3 To be consistent with previous work the estimates of
the luminosity function have been determined with M  1 and H0  100kms1Mpc1 The
010  z  030 space density is comparable to the low redshift samples of Sadler et al 1989
and Machalski and Godlowski 2000 at P14  1023WHz1 Machalski and Godlowski 2000 may
suer incompleteness at P14  1023WHz1 as their estimate of the space density decreases with
decreasing radio power The space density of 030  z  055 radio galaxies is signicantly higher
than the low redshift samples which is consistent with evolution occurring over the observed redshift
To measure the evolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function the data was been tted
with a 2 power-law function

Boyle et al 1988 Dunlop and Peacock 1990 The evolution of the luminosity function was
assumed to be pure luminosity evolution where

Boyle et al 1988 The best-t values for the C  P 0   and kL were obtained by minimizing
S  2lnL
Marshall et al 1983 where L is the likelihood The value of S is given by
S  2
lnP zi  2f
lnP zi  2Z Z P zP z
where Nrg is the number of radio galaxies in the sample Nc is the number of control objects and f
is the number of radio sources used to produce the radio galaxy catalogue divided by the number of
radio sources used to generate the control catalogue Error estimates for the measured parameters
were determined by computing S for each parameter in turn while allowing the other values
for the parameters to oat Lampton et al 1976 Boyle et al 1988 The errors quoted for the
remainder of the paper were determined for S  1 which is equivalent to 1 The goodness-of-t
of the model was tested using the 2D Kolmogorov-Smirno KS statistic described by Peacock
1983
The best-t estimate of the luminosity function is shown in Figure 8 and the estimates of
luminosity function parameters and the KS probability are listed in Table 4 To allow comparison
with low redshift samples the radio power of sources used to estimate the space density have been
divided by the estimate of the luminosity evolution The luminosity function model is comparable
to estimates of the luminosity function at low redshift Also as shown in Figure 4 the model is a
good approximation to the observed redshift distribution of Panoramic Deep Field radio galaxies
The estimates of the luminosity function parameters are aected by Malmquist bias due to
errors in the radio ux and redshift estimates To correct for this articial datasets of radio galaxies
were generated using 2 power-law functions The uxes and redshifts were then scattered assuming
their error distributions can be approximated by Gaussians The distribution of 1 values for the
radio ux error distribution were determined using the error estimates provided by the NVSS source
catalogue For the photometric redshifts the errors were estimated by computing the rms of the
dierence between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts as a function of redshift for early-type
galaxies The parameters which reproduced the observed luminosity function are listed in Table 4
With the exception of  most parameters changed by  1 and as shown in Figure 8 the estimate
of the luminosity function at z  0 is comparable the original estimate
The estimate of the luminosity function and its evolution assumes that the radio galaxy cat-
alogue is dominated by steep spectrum radio sources which is consistent with previous estimates
of the luminosity function Dunlop and Peacock 1990 However if a signicant fraction of the
radio galaxy catalogue are at-spectrum sources a smaller value of r would be more appropriate
for estimating the radio powers and the luminosities of the z  05 radio galaxies would be signif-
icantly decreased However as shown in Table 4 decreasing the value of r to 05 only decreases
the estimate of kL by  1
 8 
The estimates of the luminosity evolution are comparable to previous estimates of the evolution
of radio-loud AGN including QSOs Dunlop and Peacock 1990 The similarity of radio-loud
QSO and radio galaxy evolution is consistent with the unied theory of radio-loud AGN Barthel
1989 where radio-loud QSOs and radio galaxies are the same class of object observed at dierent
orientations The radio evolution of radio galaxies is also similar to the evolution of radio-quiet AGN
in the optical and X-ray Boyle et al 1988 1994 starburst galaxies in the radio Rowan-Robinson
et al 1993 and the star formation rate in the UV Lilly et al 1996
While the similarity of the luminosity function and its evolution to previous work is not unex-
pected it does conrm the ability of the techniques used in this work to estimate the radio galaxy
luminosity function If the color selection and photometric redshifts are used to select radio galaxies
from deep 4-m imaging it will be possible to accurately measure the decline of the z  4 radio-loud
AGN luminosity function with redshift and place constraints on the epoch of formation of AGN
The same techniques will also allow wide-eld surveys to improve estimates of the z  02 radio
galaxy luminosity function clustering and environments
7 Summary
The Panoramic Deep Fields and the NVSS have been used to compile a catalogue of BJ  235
radio galaxies In this paper we report a new estimate of the radio galaxy luminosity function at
z  01 based on this sample Radio uxes multicolor photometry and photometric redshifts have
been used to select 230 radio galaxies over 50 By matching radio sources to optical counterparts
with selection criterion that are a function of projected distance radio galaxies are selected with
high completeness without introducing a strong bias as a function of redshift There is signicant
evolution of the radio galaxy luminosity function at z  055 which can be parameterized by
luminosity evolution where P z  P 01zkL where 3  kL  5 The observed evolution of radio
galaxies is consistent with the same physical process being responsible for the evolution of radio
galaxies and radio-quiet AGN As the estimate of the luminosity function does not require large
numbers of spectroscopic redshifts it will be possible to apply the same techniques to multicolor
surveys where the time required to obtain large numbers spectroscopic redshifts is prohibitive
