ABSTRACT
The correlation between 21cm uctuations and galaxies is sensitive to the astro-
physical properties of the galaxies that drove reionization Thus detailed measure-
ments of the cross-power spectrum and its evolution could provide a powerful mea-
surement both of the properties of early galaxies and the process of reionization In
this paper we study the evolution of the cross-power spectrum between 21cm emission
and galaxies using a model which combines the hierarchical galaxy formation model
GALFORM implemented within the Millennium-II dark matter simulation with a
semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionization structure We nd that
inclusion of dierent feedback processes changes the cross-power spectrum shape and
amplitude In particular the feature in the cross-power spectrum corresponding to the
size of ionized regions is signicantly aected by supernovae feedback We calculate
predicted observational uncertainties of the cross-correlation coecient based on spec-
ications of the Murchison Wideeld Array MWA combined with galaxy surveys of
varying area and depth We nd that the cross-power spectrum could be detected over
several square degrees of galaxy survey with galaxy redshift errors z  01

INTRODUCTION
The prospect of measuring the 21 cm power spectrum from
the epoch of reionization is a focus of modern theoretical
cosmology eg Morales  Wyithe 2010 A very successful
technique has been to employ an N-body code to gener-
ate a distribution of halos and then apply radiative trans-
fer methods in post-processing to model the generation of
ionized structure on large scales using various models for
the ionizing sources eg Ciardi et al 2003 Sokasian et al
2003 Iliev et al 2007 Zahn et al 2007 Trac  Cen 2007
Shin et al 2008 Iliev et al 2008 Trac et al 2008 How-
ever when constructing models to assign ionizing luminosi-
ties to dark matter halos most studies have used a constant
mass-to-luminosity relation On the other hand the degree
to which the important astrophysics governing formation
and evolution of high redshift galaxies will inuence observa-
tions of the 21cm power spectrum is not well known To im-
prove on the source modelling for calculation of the ionizing
photon budget in reionization simulations several studies

have used GALFORM Cole et al 2000 Baugh et al 2005
Bower et al 2006 combined with Monte-Carlo merger trees
However these studies calculated only the global evolution
of reionization and are not able to address the reioniza-
tion structure Most recently Kim et al 2013 have com-
bined GALFORM implemented within the Millennium-II
dark matter simulation Boylan-Kolchin et al 2009 with a
semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ionization
structure Kim et al 2013 demonstrated the sensitivity of
the ionization structure to the astrophysics of galaxy for-
mation and found that the strength of supernovae SNe
feedback is the most important quantity
In addition to the 21 cm power spectrum several stud-
ies have previously analysed the cross-power spectrum cor-
relation between redshifted 21cm observations and galaxy
surveys Furlanetto  Lidz 2007 Lidz et al 2009 2011
Wiersma et al 2013 These models showed that the cross-
power spectrum should be observable but do not provide
a self consistent link between the astrophysics of galaxy
properties and the reionization structure For example
Furlanetto  Lidz 2007 and Lidz et al 2009 2011 used
a simple one-to-one relation between luminosity and dark

matter halo mass Conversely in Wiersma et al 2013 the
cross-power spectrum was predicted using a semi-numerical
code for 21cm emission based on dark matter overdensity
cross-correlated with a semi-analytic model for galaxies As
a result the calculation did not include the direct relation
between galaxies and ionization structure In this paper our
aim is to determine whether the cross-power spectrum can
be used to infer the properties of high redshift galaxy for-
mation We present predictions for the cross-power spec-
trum between 21cm emission and galaxies using the model
of Kim et al 2013 who directly combined detailed models
of high redshift galaxy formation using GALFORM with a
semi-numerical description and predict the resulting red-
shifted 21cm power spectrum of dierent reionization histo-
ries This model provides self-consistent results because the
ionizing sources and observed galaxies are the same These
galaxies include both the observed luminous galaxies and the
low mass  108M galaxies thought to drive reionization
We begin in  2 and  3 by describing the implementa-
tion of GALFORM our method for modelling the ionization
structure the cross-power spectrum and cross-correlation
function and the cross-correlation coecient The cross-
power spectra from our method and the eect of feedback
processes on the cross-power spectra are presented in  4
In  5 we describe the observational uncertainty We nish
with some conclusions in  6
2 THE GALFORM GALAXY FORMATION
In this section we summarise the theoretical galaxy forma-
tion modelling based on Kim et al 2013 that is used in
our analysis in order to describe the new features for this
We implement
the GALFORM Cole et al 2000
model within the the Millennium-II dark matter simulation
Boylan-Kolchin et al 2009 In this study we specically
use the Lagos implementation of GALFORM Lagos et al
2012 model described in Kim et al 2013 The simula-
tion has a cosmology including fractional mass and dark
energy densities with values of m  025  b  0045 and
075 a dimensionless Hubble constant of h073 and a
power spectrum normalisation of 809 The particle mass
of the simulation is 689106h1M and we detect haloes
down to 20 particles the minimum halo mass corresponds
to  14  108h1M in the simulation box of side length
L  100h1Mpc
Figure 1 shows the relation between the UV magnitude
the rest-frame 1500A AB magnitude including the eects
of dust extinction of galaxies and the host halo mass top
and between the total Lyman continuum luminosity  NLyc
of each galaxies and the host halo mass bottom from the
GALFORM model Of particular note is that the luminos-
ity of an ionizing source is not simply proportional to the
host halo mass as is often assumed in reionization models
Iliev et al 2011 Lidz et al 2009 2011 In part this is be-
cause of the distribution of satellite galaxies The broad scat-
ter of the relation indicates that physically motivated mod-
elling for ionizing sources during the reionization should be
included to understand the epoch of reionization We note
that this magnitude is not the same as ionizing luminos-
Figure 1 The relation between the UV magnitude the rest-
frame 1500A AB magnitude and the host halo mass top and
between the total Lyman continuum luminosity  NLyc of each

central and satellite galaxies Red orange and yellow colors rep-
resent 1 683 2 954 and 3-sigma 997 levels
ity However as shown in Figure 1 the UV magnitude the
rest-frame 1500A AB magnitude is closely related to the
ionizing luminosity Furthermore Figure 1 shows that the
predicted ionizing luminosity to mass ratio from the model
is not a simple one-to-one relation between luminosity and
dark matter halo mass
3 THE IONIZATION MODEL
In this section we summarize the calculation of the ion-
ized structure  31 and describe calculation of cross-power
spectrum and cross-correlation function  32 and  33
31 Semi-Numerical scheme to calculate the
evolution of ionizationed structure
Mesinger  Furlanetto 2007 introduced an approximate
but ecient method for simulating the reionization pro-
cess referred to as a semi-numerical technique In this pa-
per we apply a semi-numerical technique to nd the ion-
ization structure resulting from GALFORM galaxies within
the Millennium-II dark matter simulation
The simulation box is divided into cells We calculate

where Fc denotes the mean number of recombinations per

sity of neutral hydrogen follows the dark matter and self-
reionization of a cell occurs when Qcell  1 It is compli-
cated to theoretically predict the values of Fc and fesc and
the values are not known In this paper we use the values of
1  Fcfesc in table 2 of Kim et al 2013 These parame-
ters provide a reionization history with a mass-averaged ion-
ization fraction of hxii  055 at z  7272 and hxii  075
at z  6712 We divide the Millennium-II simulation box
into 2563 cells yielding cell side lengths of 03906h1Mpc
and comoving volumes of 00596h3Mpc3
Based on equation 2 individual cells can have Qcell

photons produced in a neighbouring cell In order to nd the
extent of ionized regions we therefore lter the Qcell eld us-

of redshift luminosity and host halo mass  41 We also

limits MAB1500A  5logh  18 in the model This
magnitude threshold corresponds to the deepest wide
area survey with Wide Field Camera 3infrared and the
Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy
Survey on Hubble Space Telescope Bouwens et al 2011
Finkelstein et al 2012 At each redshift we calculate a
mass-averaged ionization fraction hxii From the correla-
tion function galaxies and 21cm emission are anti-correlated
at small separations while at large separations we nd a
weak correlation These regions are separated by a transition
wavenumber at which the cross-correlation coecient and
cross-correlation function change from negative to positive
Galaxies are correlated with 21cm emission on scales larger
than the ionized regions but anti-correlated on smaller
scales The size of ionization regions therefore corresponds
to this transition wavenumber We nd that the transition
wavenumber from negative to positive cross-correlation co-
ecient increases as redshift decreases since the size of ion-
ized regions generated by galaxies increases as the Universe
evolves
Figure 3 shows the comparison of cross-power spec-
tra and cross-correlation functions between dierent host
halo mass thresholds at z  7272 hxii  055 We nd
that more massive halos exhibit stronger anti-correlation
as expected Lidz et al 2009 Wiersma et al 2013 The
same trend is also shown in Figure 4 where we compare
the results from calculations with dierent UV magnitude
MAB1500A5logh thresholds Figure 4 shows that the
transition wavenumber is similar for galaxy samples selected
at dierent luminosity thresholds since this scale is primar-
ily set by the size of HII regions
42 The eect of feedback processes
In order to investigate the eect on the power spectrum of
dierent feedback processes in galaxy formation we follow a
similar method to Kim et al 2013 We use the Lagos et al
2012 galaxy formation model as our ducial case and then
consider two variants of this hereafter called NOSN mod-
els which have supernovae feedback turned o We use two
variants of the NOSN model First we consider the inclusion
of photoionization feedback using Vcut  30 kms where
Vcut is a threshold value of the host halos circular veloc-
ity Kim et al 2013 Second we removed both supernovae
feedback and photoionization feedback by setting Vcut 
0 kms We refer to this second model as NOSN no suppres-
sion in this paper Since turning o supernovae feedback in
the Lagos et al 2012 model changes the bright end of the
UV luminosity function we have changed some other param-
eters so that the NOSN models still match the observed UV
luminosity functions at z  7272 Specically we introduce
a stellar initial mass function dominated by brown dwarfs
with   4 and also reduce the star formation timescale in
bursts by setting fdyn  2 and burstmin  0005 Gyr see
Cole et al 2000 and Lacey et al 2011 for more details of
these parameters
In Figure 5 we show the resulting comparison of cross-
power spectra and cross-correlation functions at z7272
The locations of transition wave numbers between the
Lagos et al 2012 model and the two NOSN models are
signicantly dierent see also ionization structure for these
models in Kim et al 2013 In particular the Lagos et al
2012 model has a larger transition scale On small scales
the cross-correlation function of the Lagos et al 2012
model shows stronger anti-correlation than the two NOSN
models between 21cm emissions and galaxies Furthermore
we nd that while photoionization feedback also suppresses
low luminosity galaxies the eect is smaller than the eect
of the supernovae feedback
5 DETECTABILITY
In this section we describe the error estimation of the cross-
correlation coecient  51 and discuss observational re-
quirements for future galaxy surveys  52 Our examples
are based on the MWA-like observations of the 21cm signal
combined with various hypothetical galaxy redshift surveys

mum value of the transverse component of the wave vector

52 Observational requirements for future galaxy
surveys
Following Lidz et al 2009 we begin by considering a
galaxy number density of ngal  16  104 h3Mpc3 for
a survey in combination with 21cm observations from the
MWA To match this number density in our galaxy cata-
logue we use a magnitude threshold with a value of -194
at z  7272 and -198 at z  6712 in UV magnitude
MAB1500A  5logh We also match the number den-
sity of NOSN models in the same way
To nd the general requirements for detection of the
cross-correlation in Figure 7 we show the signal to noise
SN for the cross-correlation coecient as a function of
survey area Asurvey and redshift error z In our calcu-
lations we assume 1000 hours total observing time for the
MWA The left panel of Figure 7 shows the total SN which
is calculated by summing up the SN in each k bin

corresponds to  800deg2 Note that if the galaxy survey
volume is less than the 21cm survey volume then the vari-
ance is increased by a factor of Vsurvey21Vsurveygal The
MWA is designed to operate at frequencies between 80 and
300MHz in order to observe the 21cm signal at 6  z  30
When the 21cm signal is observed at z  7 the wavelength
is  17m corresponding to  200MHz
Figure 6 shows the 21cm power spectrum with errors es-
timated based on equation 13 for cases including dierent
feedback processes The 21cm power spectra show obvious
dierences between the models for supernovae feedback es-
pecially at large scales Figure 6 reinforces the importance
of detailed modeling of galaxy formation during reionization
Kim et al 2013
The error on the galaxy power spectrum is expressed
in equation 14 The galaxy shot-noise is dependent on the
number density of galaxies observable ngal kk  k and
  czHz where z is the galaxy redshift error Here
we assume a Gaussian distribution of redshift errors
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 110
where i represent ith bin and k is the bin size We assume a
redshift error z of 005 as an example value from narrow-
band survey for Lyman- emitters Ouchi et al 2008 2010
The SN is calculated with a survey area of 800 deg2 and
then scaled the SN with the relation SN  1pAsurvey
Our default model that includes SNe feedback with Vcut 
30kms shows increased SN compared with the results of
the NOSN models The default model predicts a 3- detec-
tion of cross-correlation with a 2 deg2 survey area Survey
areas greater than 10 deg2 will provide detailed high SN
measurements
As a specic example we also calculate the total SN
as a function of z by assuming the survey area of Asurvey 
5 deg2 The total SN in the central panel of Figure 7 shows
that measurements will require redshift uncertainties less
than 01 The NOSN models show a similar shape to the
default model but have lower SN Lower accuracy red-
shifts z  01 wash out the cross-correlation signal An
error of z  01 provides measurement only on larger scales

the cross-correlation over a broad range of k redshift uncer-
tainties z less than 001 will be required
Figure 7 illustrates the conditions required for mea-
surement of the 21cm-galaxy cross-correlation Before con-
cluding we discuss these requirements with respect to real
galaxy surveys In this study we have used UV magni-
tude cuts to select galaxy samples which relate to ob-
served Lyman-break galaxies However Lyman-break galax-
ies which are photometrically selected have z  05 at z 
65 Beckwith et al 2006 much longer than the z  01 re-
quirement As a result Lyman-break surveys will not be suf-
cient to detect the cross-correlation Wiersma et al 2013
On the other hand Ly- emitters selected from narrow-band
surveys have z  00501 Ouchi et al 2008 2010 Thus
a detection could be made based on the precision and volume
of current Ly- surveys Our semi-numerical model does not
predict Ly- luminosity see Orsi et al 2008 However
the dierence between simulated populations of Ly- emit-
ters and Lyman-break galaxies is found not to be signicant
Dayal  Ferrara 2012 For the purpose of our calculation
we therefore use star forming galaxies with UV magnitudes

servation of the survey depth of z  038
While 1 deg2 represents the largest high redshift survey
at the current time future surveys will be larger For exam-
ple in the next 5 years Hyper Suprime-Cam on the Subaru
telescope will observe 105 galaxies at z  57 and 65 in a
survey area of  30 deg2 and 100s of galaxies at z  7 in
ccid13 2013 RAS MNRAS 000 110
a survey area of 3 deg2 M Ouchi private communication
As shown in Figure 7 this increased survey area will im-
prove the SN so that the cross-power spectra signal could
be detected with high signicance 2
Based on the requirement from  52 we assume a 5 deg2
galaxy survey eld and a redshift error of 005 for a fu-
ture galaxy survey We also assume 1000 hours total observ-
ing time Figure 8 shows the predicted errors for the cross-
correlation coecient within spherical bins of logarithmic
width   05 at z  6712 and 7272 for such a galaxy
survey combined with the MWA The estimated errors are
exponentially increased near the wave number of 1 hMpc1
because of the limit of kmax for a 21cm survey We com-
pare the result with the cross-correlation coecient from the
NOSN models The result shows that we could observation-
ally distinguish our default model from two dierent NOSN
models
Ly- observations at z  7 over a large area are
very challenging The latest Ly- survey at z  73
Shibuya et al 2012 has a galaxy number density of 
67  106 covering a survey area of 048 deg2 This value is
smaller than the value we assume for our error estimation
Computing the cross-power spectrum corresponding to this
number density is not possible owing to the limited box size
of our simulation However we have checked that the esti-
mated error would approximately increase by a factor of 2
when using this number density
6 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
study we have investigated evolution of
In this
cross-power spectrum cross-correlation function and cross-
correlation coecient between 21cm emission and galaxies
using the model of Kim et al 2013 This model combines
the hierarchical galaxy formation model GALFORM imple-
mented within the Millennium-II dark matter simulation
with a semi-numerical scheme to describe the resulting ion-
ization structure We nd that there is a transition wave
number k at which the cross-correlation coecient changes
from negative to positive Lidz et al 2009 This transi-
tion wave number is associated with the size of the ion-
ized regions generated by galaxies and increases with de-
creasing redshift We also nd the same trend in the cross-
power spectrum and cross-correlation function We calcu-
lated the cross-power spectrum as a function of UV lumi-
nosity MAB1500A  5logh and host halo mass These
calculations reveal that bright galaxies and galaxies residing
in massive halos have stronger anti-correlation but a similar
transition wavenumber
We have studied observational uncertainties in measure-
ment of the cross-correlation coecient based on the speci-
cations of an upgraded 512 tile Murchison Wideeld Ar-
ray MWA combined with galaxy surveys The results show
that the cross-power spectrum signal could be detected when
combined with more than 3 square degrees of a galaxy sur-
vey at the depth of the future galaxy survey having red-
shift error  01 We have also investigated the dependance

on the inclusion of feedback processes in the galaxy mod-
elling We nd that the amplitude of the cross-correlation is
larger when SNe feedback is considered and that the cross-
correlation coecient has a dierent shape compared to a
model with no SNe feedback Thus the cross-correlation
could be used to determine the importance of SNe feed-
back in high redshift galaxies Our results imply that de-
tailed modelling of reionization processes and galaxy for-
mation are required to predict an accurate cross-correlation
between 21cm emission and galaxies and to interpret future
observational measurements
