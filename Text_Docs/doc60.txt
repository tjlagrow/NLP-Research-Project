ABSTRACT
Passive spiral galaxies  unusual galaxies with spiral morphology without any sign of on-
going star formation  have recently been discovered to exist preferentially in cluster in-
falling regions at about the virial radius or at a local galaxy density of  1 Mpc2 The dis-
covery directly connects the passive spiral galaxies to the cluster galaxy evolution studies such
as the Butcher-Oemler effect or the morphology-density relation ie passive spiral galaxies
are likely to be transition objects between high-z blue spiral galaxies and low-z red cluster
early-type galaxies Thus detailed study of passive spiral galaxies potentially could bring a
new insight on the underlying physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy evolution How-
ever in previous work passive spiral galaxies are selected from the low resolution optical
images with  15 arcsec of seeing Therefore passive spirals could be a mis-identication
of S0 galaxies or dusty-starburst galaxies which are not passive at all
To answer these questions we performed a deep high-resolution near-infrared imaging
of 32 passive spiral galaxies Our high resolution K band images show clear spiral arm struc-
tures Thus passive spirals are not S0s Optical-infrared colour does not show any signs of
dusty-starburst at all Therefore it is likely that they are truly passive and spiral galaxies
in the midst of cluster galaxy evolution

1 INTRODUCTION
It is a remarkable feature that galaxy properties correlate with
the environment where that galaxy exists It has been well estab-
lished that in the dense regions such as galaxy cluster cores ES0
galaxies are dominant and that in the rareed eld regions spi-
ral galaxies are more numerous Dressler 1980 Postman  Geller

Domnguez et al 2001 2002 Helsdon  Ponman 2003 Treu et al
2003 Goto et al 2003a This is the so-called morphology-density
relation As wide area CCD based surveys and large  uniform
galaxy cluster catalogs become available Postman et al 1996 An-
nis et al 1999 Kim et al 2002 Goto et al 2002ab Postman et
al 2002 Gal et al 2003 Popesso et al 2004 recent studies on
the morphology-density relation started to reveal the environment
where galaxy morphology start to change Hogg et al 2003 Blan-
ton et al 2003aTanaka et al 2004 Goto et al 2003a revealed
that the morphology-density relation has two different breaks at lo-

cal galaxy densities of 1 Mpc2 and 03 Mpc2 possibly indicat-
ing the existence of two different physical mechanisms
Not only morphology but the star formation rate SFR of
galaxies correlates with environments It has been known for a long
time that galaxy SFR is lower in the cluster core regions resulting
in numerous red galaxies in cluster cores eg Couch  Sharples
1987Couch et al 19941998 Dressler et al 1994 Abraham et al
1996 Pimbblet et al 2002 Recently it has become possible to
specify the environment where SFR suddenly start to change eg
Kodama et al 2001 Tanaka et al 2004 Interestingly this envi-
ronment where SFR changes coincides with the environment where
galaxy morphology changes Goto et al 2004 Tanaka et al 2004
Cluster galaxies change their SFR in the same environment where
they change their morphology
It has also been known that cluster galaxies evolve Butcher 
Oemler 19781984 found that fractions of blue galaxies in clus-
ters increase with increasing redshift ie cluster galaxies evolve
from blue to red This Butcher-Oemler effect was later conrmed
by many authors Rakos Schombert 1995 Couch et al 19941998

claim was conrmed later by Goto et al 2003b2004 using the
statistical number of 516 clusters found in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey SDSS Goto et al 2002ab
From these numerous pieces of observational evidence we
know that some physical mechanism is changing the morphology
and SFR of cluster galaxies as a function of the redshift However
to date it has been difcult to specify what physical mechanisms
determine morphology and SFR of galaxies It has been simply dif-
cult to trace the complicated process of galaxy evolution with sev-
eral Giga years of timescale using the observation of only a single
However recently a population of galaxies which are likely
to shed some light on the subject has been actively debated The
galaxies are called passive spiral galaxies Couch et al 1998

pearances passive spirals do not have any emission lines indica-
tive of on-going star formation Passive spirals have been known
to exist in many cluster studies van den Bergh 1976 Wilkerson
1980 Bothun  Sullivan 1980 Phillipps 1988 Cayatte et al 1994
Couch et al 1998 Poggianti et al 1999 Bravo-Alfaro et al 2001
Elmegreen et al 2002 However their abundance in the eld re-
gion was not studied well And thus their connection to the cluster
regions has not been clear until the recent discovery by Goto et al
2003c which claims that passive spiral galaxies exist preferen-
tially in perimeter regions of galaxy clusters at around the virial
radius of or local galaxy density of  1 Mpc2 Suggesting that
passive spiral galaxies are created by some cluster related physical
mechanism this discovery will bring signicant implications on the
underlying physical mechanism Since passive spirals are expected
to evolve into red early type cluster galaxies in a few Gyr pas-
sive spirals are likely to be intermediate transition objects between
high-z blue spirals and low-z red early type cluster galaxies And
thus by studying passive spiral galaxies in detail we may be able to
specify the physical mechanism responsible for the cluster galaxy
evolution
However since the result of Goto et al 2003c was based on
the SDSS and the Two Micron All Sky Survey 2MASS Jarrett et

Figure 1 The distributions of SFR estimated from the H luminosity The
solid line and the dashed line are for the passive spiral galaxies and the star-
forming galaxies respectively Note that these SFRs of passive spiral galax-
ies the solid line should be considered as upper limits since the H line is
not detected in these passive spiral galaxies and the continuum around H
wavelength is used to estimate the presented SFR
al 2000 data which have relatively poor image resolution  15
arcsec of seeing and large photometric error there have been two
remaining important uncertainties before interpreting passive spi-
rals as transition objects
i Are passive spirals not S0s
ii Are passive spirals not dusty starburst galaxies
If Goto et al 2003c mis-identied some S0 galaxies as passive
spirals due to the poor seeing condition of the SDSS  15 arc-
sec their discovery is less interesting since S0 galaxies are more
common and very well studied in the literature Also if the emis-
sion lines of passive spirals are just suppressed by the heavy obscu-
ration by dust in optical wavelength passive spirals might not be
passive at all
In order to answer these two questions we performed a deep
K band imaging of passive spiral galaxies Deeper imaging will
reveal detailed morphology of passive spirals In addition near-
infrared light is less affected by the dust extinction and thus allows
us to distinguish dusty starburst galaxies from passive spirals
This paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we describe
the deep K band observations we performed In Section 3 we
present the results In Section 4 we discuss the physical impli-
cations of our results In Section 5 we summarize our work and
ndings The cosmological parameters adopted throughout this pa-
per are H075 km s1 Mpc1 and mk030700
based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey data Abazajian et al 2003
and therefore is free from Malmquist type of bias Fig 1 shows the
distribution of star formation rate SFR for these 73 passive spiral
galaxies computed from the luminosity in H the solid line The
SFR is calculated using a conversion formula given in Kennicutt
1998 assuming constant extinction of 1 magnitude at the wave-
length of H We caution readers that these SFRs of passive spiral
galaxies should be considered as upper limits since the H line
is not detected in these passive spiral galaxies and the continuum
around H wavelength is used to estimate the SFR in Fig 1 As a
comparison sample we have selected star-forming spiral galaxies
as galaxies with both detected OII and H emission lines with
 1 signicance and with the concentration index consistent to
be a spiral Cinr  05 Here Cinr is dened as the ratio of
Petrosian 50 ux radius to Petrosian 90 ux radius in r Shi-
masaku et al 2001 The distribution of SFR in the star-forming
spiral galaxies is shown with the dashed line in Fig 1 Compared
with the star-forming spiral galaxies the dashed line our target
passive spiral galaxies the solid line have lower SFR by about an
order or more The difference again demonstrate that our target
passive spiral galaxies indeed have much lower SFR than normal
spiral galaxies in the eld region
Among 73 passive spiral galaxies all 32 passive spiral galax-
ies accessible during the run on 2003 September 10-11 were ob-
served on the 38m United Kingdom Infrared Telescope UKIRT
in the K band 22 m using the UKIRT Fast Track Imager
UFTI UFTI is a 1-25 m InSb imager with 1024  1024 pixel
Each pixel subtends 0091 arcsec on the sky UFTIs eld of view
is  90 arcsec Data were taken in periods of good atmospheric
transparency and with the excellent seeing of 05 arcsec For each
galaxy we used two sets of 33 grid of dithered position exposures
of 60 sec each The integration time is 18 mins for each galaxy
Calibration was obtained by observing a selection of UKIRT faint
standards Hawarden et al 2001 on each night The data were ana-
lyzed with the ORAC-DR data reduction pipeline which automates
the dark subtraction at-elding re-sampling and de-spiking pro-
cesses The photometry was performed using IRAF v2121 phot
routines within 2 Petrosian radius measured in the SDSS r band
image Stoughton et al 2002
In addition to the 32 passive spiral galaxies we have ob-
served 12 early-type galaxies as a control sample These early-
type galaxies were selected from the same volume limited sample
005  z  01 Mr  205 as galaxies with Cinr  04
and thus mainly consist of elliptical and S0 galaxies We compare
this control sample with passive spiral galaxies in order to test truly
passive and spiral nature of the galaxies
The purpose in using K band is two-folded First the K band
is relatively free from dust extinction Therefore we can test dust
extinction in passive spirals using r  K colour Also since the
K band traces the old stellar population ie the dominant mass
distribution in galaxies it is suitable to study galaxy morphology

31 K-band Galaxy Morphology
We have selected our target galaxies from 73 passive spiral galaxies
presented in Goto et al 2003c All 73 passive spiral galaxies do
not have any emission in OII nor H  1 in equivalent width
and have disc-like morphology This sample is selected from a vol-
ume limited sample of galaxies 005  z  01 Mr  205
First we present K band morphology of passive spirals to make
sure that they are not S0 galaxies which are more common and
known to have passive nature In Fig 2 we show K band images of
32 passive spiral galaxies taken with the UKIRT The deep and high
resolution imaging capability of UKIRT can probe the discs and

spiral arm structures in the passive spiral galaxies Although there
are two cases where disc structures are not clear due to the pres-
ence of a nearby bright object SDSSJ01240919-00255597 and
SDSSJ01585517-10514325 the rest of the passive spiral galax-
ies have discs and spiral arm structures without contamination from
more common S0 galaxies
Qualitatively we measured the concentration of passive spi-
ral galaxies as a ratio of Petrosian 50 ux radius to 90 ux
radius using the ux measured in the K band Note that this con-
centration parameter CinK  is an inverse of the commonly used
concentration parameter and thus later-type galaxies have larger
values of CinK  Since our K band images are much deeper with
twice as high resolution as the SDSS images CinK provides us
with a better description of galaxy morphology than the concentra-
tion parameter used in Goto et al 2003 Since the seeing size was
almost constant during the two days of observation  05 arcsec
and our galaxies are at a similar redshift z  008 we did not cor-
rect for the seeing In Fig 3 we show the distribution of CinK for
both the passive spirals the solid line and the control sample the
dashed line Reassuringly passive spiral galaxies and the control
sample of early type galaxies have a very different CinK distribu-
tion with passive spirals having much higher values of CinK  A
Kolomogorov-Smirnov test shows that these two distributions are
different with more than 9999 signicance This difference in

tude are shown for 22 galaxies commonly observed with both of the two
telescopes The mean deviation and rms is 005 and 017 respectively Note
that K is in AB system in this gure
the CinK distribution assures that our passive spiral galaxies are
indeed different galaxy population than well-studied S0 galaxies
32 Optical-Infrared Colour
Next we present optical-infrared r  K colour distribution of
passive spiral galaxies in order to check whether they are dusty
starburst galaxies or truly passive galaxies Since K band is less
affected by the dust extinction than r band dusty starburst galaxies
are known to have redder colours in r  K by  1 mag Smail et
al 1999  Fig 4 plots g  i colour against r  K colour Opti-
cal photometries g r and i are from the SDSS and k-corrected
to the restframe using the routine given in Blanton et al 2003b
v1 11 The black circles are for passive spiral galaxies observed
with UKIRT The squares are for early-type galaxies in the control
sample For a reference we plot the distribution of all galaxies in
the volume limited sample with K magnitudes measured with the
Two Micron All Sky Survey 2MASS Jarrett et al 2000 as the
contour When comparing 2MASS K magnitude with the UKIRT
K magnitudes we found a slight shift between these two mag-
nitudes as shown in Fig 5 We have calibrated this offset using
22 galaxies commonly observed with both 2MASS and UKIRT to
match UKIRT K mag to 2MASS K mag K band magnitudes are
K-corrected using Mannucci et al 2001 The error bars are plot-
ted as horizontal and perpendicular bars Compared with the error
with 2MASS K K  01 the UKIRT observation reduced the
error in K magnitude signicantly K  003 cf Fig 13 of
Goto et al 2003c Interestingly compared with all galaxies the
contour passive spiral galaxies circles are not redder at all in
r  K colour Indeed r  K colours of passive spiral galaxies are
indistinguishable from early-type galaxies squares These results
support truly passive nature of these galaxies since dusty starburst
galaxies should have r  K colour by 1 magnitude redder than
normal galaxies ie r  K  18 See Smail et al 1999
4 DISCUSSION
In Section 3 we have answered the two remaining questions
on passive spiral galaxies using the deep K band imaging with
UKIRT i passive spiral galaxies indeed have discs  spiral arm
structures and therefore they are a different population of galax-
ies from S0 galaxies ii optical-infrared r  K colour does not
show any signs of dusty starburst galaxies Therefore they must be
truly passive galaxies In this section we discuss physical implica-
tions of our results Since our UKIRT observation has secured that
passive spiral galaxies are truly spiral galaxies with no star forma-
tion we now have to take it more seriously that these passive spiral
galaxies exist in the cluster perimeter regions Goto et al 2003c
It has been long discussed whether the properties of cluster
galaxies are by their nature or nurtured later According to the
standard hierarchical clustering model galaxies in high density re-
gions of the Universe such as galaxy clusters have collapsed ear-
lier and thus more evolved than galaxies in the low density eld
regions In addition to this galaxies in dense regions have been
subject to additional physical mechanisms specic to the dense re-
gions Therefore it is important to understand whether properties
of cluster galaxies were established early in the universe when the
galaxy assembled nature or they are later formed by the physi-
cal mechanisms specic to the dense regions nurture Goto et al
2003c have found that passive spiral galaxies preferentially exist
in cluster perimeter regions If passive spiral galaxies do not exist in
the low density eld regions the result may favor the nurture sce-
nario where only cluster specic physical mechanisms can create
passive spiral galaxies
Various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the cluster galaxy evolution Possible mechanisms include ram-
pressure stripping of gas Gunn  Gott 1972 Farouki  Shapiro
1980 Kent 1981 Fujita  Nagashima 1999 Abadi Moore 
Bower 1999 Quilis Moore  Bower 2000 Fujita  Goto 2004

gradual decline in the SFR of a galaxy due to the stripping of halo
gas strangulation or suffocation Larson Tinsley  Caldwell 1980
Bekki et al 2002 Kodama et al 2001 Finoguenov et al 2003b
Among all of these strong dynamical interactions such as
cluster tidal forces and major interactionmerging of galaxies are
less preferred since such processes distort the morphology of galax-
ies and cannot explain spiral arm structures in passive spiral galax-
Among the rest since passive spirals exist in the environment
with a local galaxy density of  1 Mpc2 or at about the virial
radius those mechanisms that work in this environment are good
candidates for the creation of passive spiral galaxies Kodama et al
2001 and Tanaka et al 2004 discussed that plasma gas density
is too low at the virial radius for ram-pressure stripping of the cold
gas in a galactic disc concluding that stripping of hot halo gas is
preferred to the stripping of cold gas However using the analyt-
ical model Fujita 2003 showed that the cold gas stripping can
be effective at around the virial radius at higher redshift also see
Fujita  Goto 2004 Mihos et al 2003 proposed that infalling
sub-groups may have high enough gas density to strip the cold gas
Unfortunately to further specify the responsible mechanisms
is rather difcult Any of the remaining mechanisms can work at the
environment around the virial radius Since most of the processes
act over a period of a few Gyr observations at one redshift cannot
easily provide the detailed information that is needed to specify one
process It is also worth noting that EA post-starburst galaxies
Dressler  Gunn 1983 which have been thought to be transi-
tion objects in cluster galaxy evolution were found to have their
origin in mergerinteraction in the general eld region Goto et al
2003de And thus explaining cluster galaxy evolution using EA
galaxies is not realistic anymore
More importantly Tanaka et al 2004 found that the environ-
mental dependence of galaxies properties is different for bright and
faint galaxies Faint galaxies M   1  Mr  M   2 have
a break at the same environment as this work On the other hand
bright galaxies Mr  M 1 do not have a specic break in envi-
ronmental dependence and their properties monotonically change
as a function of the environment Goto et al 2003a found two
breaks on the morphology-density relation These results might be
indicating that there may be two or more different physical pro-
cesses at work and that passive spiral galaxies may be the transition
objects of only one physical mechanism among many
However discovering transition objects in a certain environ-
ment is one step forward compared with previous work Since we
now know what galaxies we should trace observing the abundance
and properties of passive spiral galaxies toward higher redshift
clusters will bring further implications on the underlying physi-
cal mechanism As a forerunner Goto et al 2004 identied a
population of red late-type galaxies rapidly changing morphology
at z  017 Among various semi-analytic simulations of cluster
galaxy evolution eg Okamoto  Nagashima 2001 Diaferio et
al 2001 Benson et al 2001 Springel et al 2001 Shioya et al
20012002 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 any that predict passive
spirals as transition objects should be favored
5 SUMMARY
We have performed a deep K band imaging of 32 passive spiral
galaxies with the UKIRT in order to answer the remaining two
questions in the subject i passive spirals are S0s or not ii they
are dusty starburst galaxies or not Our results are summarized as
follows
 All 32 K band images of passive spiral galaxies with seeing of
 05 arcsec show clear spiral arm structures in the disc except two
unclear cases due to a nearby bright object The distribution of the
concentration parameter is different from that of early-type galax-
ies with more than 9999 signicance We conclude that passive
spirals are a different population of galaxies from S0s
 Optical-infrared colour r  K of passive spiral galaxies is
not redder than that of normal galaxies Therefore passive spiral
galaxies are not likely to be dusty starburst galaxies
Since our results support truly passive and spiral nature
of these galaxies it is very likely that passive spiral galaxies are
indeed transition objects currently undergoing cluster galaxy evo-
lution Further study of passive spiral galaxies will have further im-
plications for the physical mechanisms governing cluster galaxy
evolution
