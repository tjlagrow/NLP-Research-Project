Community OLAC is a new project to
build a worldwide system of federated
language archives based on the Open
Archives Initiative and the Dublin Core
Metadata Initiative This paper aims
to disseminate the OLAC vision to the
language resources community in Asia
and to show language technologists and
linguists how they can document their
tools and data in such a way that others
can easily discover them We describe
OLAC and the OLAC Metadata Set then
discuss two key issues in the Asian
context
language classication and
multilingual resource classication
1 Introduction
linguists
including
including archivists
Language technology and the linguistic sciences
are confronted with a vast array of language
resources richly structured
large and diverse
communities depend on language
Multiple
resources
engineers
teachers and actual speakers Many individuals
and institutions provide key pieces of
software
infrastructure
Today we have
developers and publishers
unprecedented opportunities to connect
communities to the language resources they need
the individuals who
use and create language resources are looking
for three things data tools and advice By
data we mean any information that documents
or describes a language such as a published
monograph
a computer data le or even
a shoebox full of hand-written index cards
The information could range in content from
unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed
and annotated texts to a complete descriptive
We can observe that

from here
creating
facilitate
resources that
such as fonts
By tools we mean computational
grammar
resources
viewing
querying or otherwise using language data
Tools include not just software programs but
also the digital
the programs
depend on
stylesheets and
document type denitions By advice we mean
any information about what data sources are
reliable what tools are appropriate in a given
situation what practices to follow when creating
new data and so forth eg
the Corpora List
archives httpwwwhituibnocorpora
In the context of OLAC
the term language
resource is broadly construed to include all three
of these data tools and advice
Unfortunately todays user does not have ready
access to the resources that are needed Figure 1
offers a diagrammatic view of this reality Some
archives eg Archive 1 do have a site on the
internet which the user is able to nd so the
resources of that archive are accessible Other
archives eg Archive 2 are on the internet so
the user could access them in theory but the user
has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in
practice Still other archives eg Archive 3 are
not even on the internet And there are potentially
hundreds of archives eg Archive n that the user
needs to know about Tools and advice are out
there as well but are at many different sites
For instance
There are many other problems inherent in the
current situation
the user may
not be able to nd all the existing data about a
language of interest because different sites have
called it by different names low recall The
user may be swamped with irrelevant resources
because search terms have important meanings in
other domains low precision The user may not
be able to use an accessible data le for lack of
being able to match it with the right tools The
user may locate advice that seems relevant but
have no basis for judging its merits
As web-indexing technologies improve one
might hope that a general-purpose search engine
should be sufcient to bridge the gap between
people and the resources they need However
this is a vain hope
First many language
resources such as audio les and software are
not text-based Second many language names
have several variants and these various strings
regularly denote things other than languages
Third much of the material is notand will never
bedocumented in free prose on the web In place
of traditional web-indexing two new initiatives
provide the necessary infrastructure for language
resource discovery
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in
1995 to develop conventions for resource discov-
ery on the web dublincoreorg The Dublin
Core metadata elements represent a broad inter-
disciplinary consensus about the core set of ele-
ments that are likely to be widely useful to sup-
port resource discovery The Dublin Core con-

ment is optional and repeatable Title Creator Sub-

The Open Archives
Initiative OAI was
launched in October 1999 to provide a common
framework across electronic preprint archives
and it has since been broadened to include digital
repositories of scholarly materials regardless of
their type1 To implement the OAI infrastructure
an archive must comply with two standards the
OAI Shared Metadata Set Dublin Core which
facilitates interoperability across all repositories
participating in the OAI and the OAI Metadata
Harvesting Protocol which allows software

Figure 2 A Service Provider Accessing Multiple
Data Providers
services
requests
to query a repository using HTTP
OAI archives are called data providers
and typically have a submission procedure a
long-term storage system and a mechanism
permitting users to obtain materials from the
archive An OAI service provider provides
end-user servicessuch as search functions over
union catalogsbased on metadata harvested
from one or more data providers
Figure 2
illustrates a single service provider accessing
three data providers using the OAI metadata
harvesting protocol End-users only interact with
service providers
The OAI
infrastructure has the bottom-up
distributed character of the web while simulta-
neously having the efcient structured nature
of a centralized database This combination is
well-suited to the language resource community
where the available data is growing rapidly and
where a large user-base is fairly consistent in
how it describes its resource needs
OAI data providers may support metadata stan-
dards in addition to the Dublin Core Thus a
specialist community like the language resources
community can dene a metadata format tailored
to its domain Using the OAI infrastructure the
communitys archives can be federated a vir-
tual meta-archive collects all the information into
a single place and end-users can query multiple
archives simultaneously
In the case of OLAC
the Linguistic Data Consortium has harvested the
catalogs of ten participating archives and created
a search interface which permits queries over all
9000 records A single search typically returns
records from multiple archives The prototype
can be accessed via wwwlanguage-archives
2 A Core Metadata Set for Language
Resources
The OLAC Metadata Set extends the Dublin
Core set only to the minimum degree required
to express those basic properties of language
resources which are useful as nding aids All
fteen Dublin Core elements are used in the
OLAC Metadata Set In order to suit the specic
needs of the language resources community
the elements have been qualied following
principles articulated in Dublin Core Qualiers
DCMI 2000 and explained below This section
lists the OLAC metadata elements and controlled
vocabularies
Full details are available from
wwwlanguage-archivesorg
21 Metadata attributes
Three attributes  rene code and lang  are used
throughout the metadata set to handle most qual-
ications to Dublin Core Some elements in the
OLAC Metadata Set use the rene attribute to iden-
tify element renements These qualiers make
the meaning of an element narrower or more spe-
cic A rened element shares the meaning of the
unqualied element but with a more restricted
scope DCMI 2000
Some elements in the OLAC Metadata Set use
the code attribute to hold metadata values that are
taken from a specic encoding scheme When an
element may take this attribute the attribute value
species a precise value for the element taken
from a controlled vocabulary or formal notation
23
In such cases the element content may
also be used to specify a free-form elaboration of
the coded value
Every element in the OLAC Metadata Set may
use the lang attribute
It species the language
in which the text in the content of the element
is written The value for the attribute comes
from a controlled vocabulary OLAC-Language
By default the lang attribute has the value en
for English Whenever the language of the
element content is other than English the lang
attribute should be used to identify the language
By using multiple instances of the metadata
elements tagged for different
languages data
providers may offer their metadata records in
multiple languages Service providers may use
this information in order to offer multilingual
views of the metadata
22 The elements of the OLAC Metadata Set
In this section we present a synopsis of the
elements of the OLAC metadata set
elements
controlled
associated with a
vocabulary
These are parenthesized and
discussed later Each element is optional and
repeatable
Title A name given to the resource
Creator An entity primarily responsible for
making the content of the resource OLAC-
Subject The topic of the content of the resource
Subjectlanguage A language which the content
the resource describes or discusses
OLAC-Language
Description An account of the content of the
resource
Publisher An entity responsible for making the
resource available
Contributor An entity responsible for making
contributions to the content of the resource
OLAC-Role
Date A date associated with an event in the life
cycle of the resource
Type The nature or genre of the content of the
resource DC-Type
Typelinguistic The nature or genre of the content
of the resource from a linguistic standpoint
OLAC-Linguistic-Type
Typefunctionality The functionality of a software
resource OLAC-Functionality
Format The physical or digital manifestation of
the resource OLAC-Format
Formatcpu The CPU required to use a software
resource OLAC-CPU

present resource is derived
Language A language of the intellectual content
of the resource OLAC-Language
Relation A reference to a related resource
Coverage The extent or scope of the content of
the resource eg spatial or temporal
Rights Information about rights held in and over
the resource OLAC-Rights
Rightssoftware Information about
in and over a software resource
Software-Rights
rights held
Observe that some elements such as Format
Formatencoding and Formatmarkup are applicable
to software as well as to data Service providers
can exploit this feature to match data with appro-
priate software tools
23 The controlled vocabularies
Controlled vocabularies are enumerations of
legal values for the code and rene attributes
and are currently undergoing development
some cases more than one value applies and the
corresponding element must be repeated once
for each applicable value In other cases no value
is applicable and the corresponding element is
simply omitted In yet other cases the controlled
vocabulary may fail to provide a suitable item
in which case the most similar vocabulary item
can be optionally specied and a prose comment
included in the element content
OLAC-Language A vocabulary for identifying
the languages that the data is in or that a
piece of linguistic description is about or
that a particular tool can process
OLAC-Linguistic-Type The primary linguistic
descriptors
resource
transcription annotation description and lexicon
with subcodes for each type
language
OLAC-CPU A vocabulary for identifying the
CPUs for which the software is available
in the case of binary distributions x86 mips
alpha ppc sparc 680x0
OLAC-Encoding A vocabulary for identifying
the character encoding used by a digital
resource eg iso-8859-1 
textsf
OLAC-Format A vocabulary for identifying
the manifestation of the resource
representation is inspired by MIME types
for SIL standard format
Formatmarkup is used to identify the
particular tagset
It may be necessary
to add new types and subtypes to cover
non-digital holdings such as manuscripts
microforms and so forth and we expect
to be able to incorporate an existing
vocabulary
OLAC-Functionality A vocabulary for clas-
sifying the functionality of software again
using the MIME style of representation
and using the HLT Survey as a source of
categories Cole 1997 as advocated by
the ACLDFKI Natural Language Software
Registry For example writtenOCR would
cover written language input print or
handwriting optical character recognition
OLAC-OS A vocabulary for identifying the
operating systems for which the software
is available Unix MacOS OS2 MSDOS
MSWindows Each of these has optional
subtypes eg UnixLinux MSWindowswinNT
OLAC-Rights A vocabulary for classifying
the rights held over a resource eg open
restricted 
OLAC-Role A vocabulary
identifying
the role of a contributor or creator of the
resource eg
translator
transcriber sponsor 
author editor
OLAC-Software-Rights A vocabulary
classifying the rights held over a resource
eg open-source royalty-free-library royalty-
free-binary commercial 
OLAC-Sourcecode A vocabulary for identify-
ing the programming languages used by
software which is distributed in source form
eg C Java Python Tcl VB 
Issues for the Asian Language
Resources Community
knowledge
comprehensive
Language identication is probably the most
fundamental kind of information that can be
given to any language resource Simons 2000
The most
for language identication is the Ethnologue
Grimes 2000 an online searchable database
which has been built up over fty years The
Ethnologue database contains
of information for each language
a unique
three-letter code the country where this language
is spoken alternative names dialects language
classication comments and references to the
SIL bibliography This section discusses a variety
of issues relating to language identication and
to the specication of the languages covered
by multilingual resources We believe these are
two key issues for the Asian language resources
community
several
Issues with language identication
In order to identify and catalog a language it is
crucial to dene what counts as a language and to
distinguish languages from dialects The editors
of the Ethnologue have made thousands of such
decisions using advice from hundreds of experts
around the world However for many languages
scholarship remains patchy or else there is schol-
arly disagreement
In such cases the best that
the Ethnologue can do is what it does already
represent incomplete knowledge and then pro-
duce periodic updates to reect the results of new
research
As OLAC grows Ethnologue codes will be
deployed widely Each new OLAC-conformant
archive will be faced with a range of issues
in seeking to associate language codes with
language resources
For concreteness we
have chosen for our examples the Formosan
languages a group of Austronesian languages
spoken in Taiwan We put ourselves in the shoes
of the eld research group at Academia Sinica
Elizabeth Zeitoun personal communication
and try to envisage the problems which they
might encounter in assigning Ethnologue codes
to their language resources
We see three broad categories of problem
over-chunking and omission
over-splitting
Over-splitting occurs when a language variety
is treated as a distinct language For example
Nataoran is given its own language code AIS
even though the scholars at Academia Sinica
consider it to be a dialect of Amis ALV Over-
chunking occurs when two distinct
languages
are treated as dialects of a single language there
does not appear to be an example of this in the
Ethnologues treatment of Formosan languages
Omission occurs when a language is not listed
For example
languages Luilang
and Quaquat are not listed in the Ethnologue
Another kind of omission problem occurs when
the language is actually listed but
the name
by which the archivist knows it is not listed
whether as a primary name or an alternate name
In such a case the archivist cannot make the
match to assign the proper code For instance
the language listed as Taroko TRV in the
Ethnologue is known as Seediq by the Academia
Sinica several of the alternate names listed by
the Ethnologue are similar but none matches
exactly
two extinct
Beyond these three problems with language
identication a further type of problem concerns
for most
language family
scholarly disagreement over
classication
The Ethnologue follows the
Oxford International Encyclopedia of Linguistics
Bright 1992
language families
For the Austronesian languages
including the
Formosan languages the Ethnologue follows the
Comparative Austronesian Dictionary Tryon
1994 Additionally some changes have been
entered in the light of more recent comparative
studies2 Academia Sinica has developed its
own language
family classication scheme
for Formosan languages and this differs from
the EthnologueTryon scheme
Additionally
languages typically have many variant names
and scholars may disagree on the choice
of a canonical name for the language
example the Academia Sinica scholars believe
Taroko to be a variant of Seediq while the
EthnologueTryon would presumably consider
Seediq to be a variant of Taroko
The consequences of these problems for clas-
sication and retrieval are obvious In the case of
over-splitting as with AIS and ALV mentioned
above someone searching for Amis resources
will need to know to search over both codes An
archivist cataloging a resource which is ambigu-
ous with respect to the AISALV distinction per-
haps because it was created by someone who did
not believe in the distinction may need to assign
both codes
In the case of over-chunking an
archivist cannot specify the individual language
but must use a code which designates two or more
languages Someone searching for resources in
one of those languages will experience lower pre-
cision In the case of omission no language code
can be assigned and classication and search
must fall back to using conventional string rep-
resentations for language names with the atten-
dant precision and recall problems In the case of
differing language family classications the pre-
cision and recall of searches on language family
names are reduced
All of these problems can be addressed through
existing Ethnologue mechanisms3 However
OLAC metadata and service providers could offer
complementary remedies
Controlling element content The Language
Subjectlanguage
elements

comethnodocsquestionnairesasp
language code to be specied in the code attribute
while the element content
is unrestricted A
community of Formosan scholars could develop
a controlled vocabulary for identifying speech
varieties down to any level of detail they liked
and then use those terms as the content of
the Language or Subjectlanguage element For
example the following are ve varieties of the
Bunun language
language codex-sil-BNNNorthernTakituduh
language codex-sil-BNNNorthernTakibakha
language codex-sil-BNNCentralTakbanuaz
language codex-sil-BNNCentralTakivatan
language codex-sil-BNNSouthernIsbukun
If no Ethnologue
code corresponded to
the group of languages in question as in the
AmisNataoran case the code attribute could be
omitted though this would prevent recall on the
Ethnologue code This general approach could
be formalized by permitting subcommunities
to register an encoding scheme as a controlled
vocabulary with a unique name That name
would be specied as the value of a new scheme
attribute and the element content would be
constrained to be an item from the corresponding
vocabulary These approaches would address the
problems of over-chunking and omission
Registering language groups with an OLAC
registration service While the classication
of a language is sometimes treated as metadata
for resources in that language we believe that a
more appropriate location for this type of nding
aid is in OLAC service providers OLAC could
maintain a language classication server which
would house a comprehensive list of language
family names and their extensional denitions
ie sets of Ethnologue codes The server would
permit users to dene their own language group
names or their own versions of existing group
For instance Academia Sinica could
register a language group name ASAmis with the
extension ALV AIS Searching on their notion
of Amis would return resources classied
under both codes Entire classication schemes
with complex hierarchies could be represented in
this fashion OLAC service providers could index
their harvested metadata using these names
allowing any user to perform searches using
any classication scheme Over time the more
respected and popular classications could be
identied and accorded due prominence This
mechanism would address
the problems of
over-splitting and differing classication
Issues with multilingual resources
For many language resources it is necessary to
identify more than one language In some cases
such as MT systems and bilingual lexicons there
is an added complication namely directionality
Someone looking for such a resource will usually
want to specify source andor target languages
For example
in searching for a Korean-to-
English resource
the user would not usually
be interested in discovering English-to-Korean
resources Thus there is an a priori need for
resources to be described using ordered pairs of
languages
OLAC provides some mechanisms which can
be applied to these cases First OLAC meta-
data elements are repeatable eg a system which
can process multiple languages will be described
using multiple Subjectlanguage elements one per
language Second OLAC incorporates direction-
ality in its distinction between Language and Sub-
jectlanguage Are these simple mechanisms ade-
quate for the convenient and accurate description
and discovery of multilingual resources In this
section we enumerate the main types of multilin-
gual resource and show how OLAC metadata can
be used to classify them We report some prob-
lems and discuss possible solutions
Machine Translation Systems
The simplest type of MT system is a unidirec-
tional system which translates language S to lan-
guage T  Here the intended audience of such a
system is assumed to be the speakers of language
T who use the system to access documents in
another language S The OLAC solution would
be to designate S as the Subjectlanguage and T as
the Language
Note that audience is slightly problematic
Such an MT system may be intended for an audi-
ence of S speakers who wish to translate their
documents into language T  The problem here
is not with directionality but with the notion of
audience in the OLAC denition of Language
The denition could be adjusted to remove this
problem
Next in order of complexity is the bidirectional
case where a system translates in both directions
between languages X and Y  Extending the pre-
vious solution we would designate both X and
Y as Language and Subjectlanguage Ideally we
would use order or structure to group the lan-
guages appropriately
pairSubjectlanguage code X
Language code Ypair
pairSubjectlanguage code Y
Language code Xpair
However OLAC metadata is at and unordered
The only available options are permutations of the
following in which we can make no contrastive
use of order
Language code X
Language code Y
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
Although this loses information we do not
believe it presents a problem for typical kinds of
retrieval Queries for an MT system i from X
ii from Y  iii to X iv to Y  v from X to
Y  or vi from Y to X will discover the system
described above
Next are MT systems which translate from
one language into many or from many languages
into one star congurations Here the obvious
approach is adequate
One-to-many
Subjectlanguage code S
Language code T1
Language code T2
Language code T3
Many-to-one
Subjectlanguage code S1
Subjectlanguage code S2
Subjectlanguage code S3
Language code T
Finally
there are MT systems which trans-
late from and to all languages in a set of n lan-
guages Here again the obvious approach is ade-
quate and is clearly superior to a solution where
all nn  1 ordered pairs are enumerated
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
Subjectlanguage code Z
Language code X
Language code Y
Language code Z
Multilingual Lexicons
A unidirectional bilingual lexicon with lem-
mas in language S and denitions in language
T is described like a unidirectional MT system
The OLAC solution is to designate S as the Sub-
jectlanguage and T as the Language A fully bidi-
rectional lexicon intended for use by speakers of
either language would be described in the same
fashion as a bidirectional MT system
Language code X
Language code Y
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
As before this solution has lost some struc-
ture but retrieval behavior is correct nonetheless
Of course
this metadata could equally be the
collection-level metadata for a set of two mono-
lingual dictionaries one in language X and one in
language Y  However the Typelinguistic element
would distinguish these cases by having different
vocabulary items for monolingual and bilingual
lexicons
lexicons may also exhibit star
Multilingual
congurations
one-to-many lexicons with
denitions in multiple languages or many-to-
one comparative wordlists Here the treatment
is analogous to the corresponding MT systems
discussed above
Finally multilingual
lexicons may map
between all pairs of a set of languages as in the
case of some termbanks
In this case all the
languages are designated both using Language
and Subjectlanguage
Text Collections
The most simple case of a text collection is a
set of texts in a single language Usually the
language in these texts would be described using
the Language element However in the situa-
tion where the text collection is intended to doc-
ument a language then it is simultaneously in
and about that language Accordingly it would
be tempting to describe this with both the Lan-
guage and Subjectlanguage elements Rather than
let the decision about metadata depend on the
intent of the creator of the resource which may
not be known or on the typical usage of the
resource which may change through time we
think it would be simplest to describe such sit-
uations using the Language element only This
approach generalizes to the case of a text col-
lection spanning multiple languages eg where
each text comes from one of the Formosan lan-
guages Here collection-level metadata would
provide a Language element for each language
represented in the collection
In the case of bilingual aligned texts bitexts
there is normally a directionality since one of
the texts is primary and the other is a translation
Here we specify the primary language using Sub-
jectlanguage and the translation using Language
A complication arises when the texts or bitexts
employ analytical notations For a text in lan-
guage X transcribed in a notation such as the
International Phonetic Alphabet which is inac-
cessible to speakers of X assuming any exist it
would make sense to use Subjectlanguage instead
of Language The situation becomes more vexing
for texts with embedded annotations such as the
notation of Conversation Analysis where non-
specialists could discard the annotations to get
a conventional text Here the use of both Sub-
jectlanguage and Language seems to be indicated
Descriptions
The nal category we consider is linguistic
descriptions such as eld notes and grammars
In the usual case the language described is spec-
ied with Subjectlanguage while the language of
the commentary is specied with Language One
interesting case is where a third language is used
for elicitation For example a sentence from
Amis may have been elicited using a sentence
from Chinese and both sentences may have been
entered in the eld notes Next commentary in
the language of the linguist such as English may
have been added In this case we would say that
the eld notes include bitext and the languages
of the bitext would be described in the usual way
The audience language of the eld notes would
also be specied Using OLACs at metadata we
would specify the languages as follows
Subjectlanguage codex-sil-AIS
Language codex-sil-CFR
Language codex-sil-ENG
We believe this is perfectly adequate for
the majority of retrieval purposes
If it were
necessary to represent
structure more
accurately two OLAC records could be associated
with the same resource one describing the
eld notes as a whole with the above language
designations and one describing the bitext
content with just the AIS and CFR designations
The different linguistic types would be expressed
using the Typelinguistic element and the two
records could refer
to each other using the
Relation element

4 Conclusions
This paper has presented the leading ideas of the
Open Language Archives Community OLAC
along with its metadata set and controlled vocabu-
laries Language resources exhibit great diversity
and include all types of data tools and advice
As collections of language resources proliferate
OLAC will make it maximally easy for mem-
bers of the language resources community to dis-
cover each others resources Another dimen-
sion of OLAC not discussed here will permit
community-agreed best practices to be identied
greatly facilitating resource re-use
Members of the Asian language resources
community are encouraged to join OLAC and
contribute to the development of OLAC metadata
vocabularies and archives

Language technology and the linguistic sciences
are confronted with a vast array of language
resources richly structured
large and diverse
communities depend on language
Multiple
resources
engineers
teachers and actual speakers Many individuals
and institutions provide key pieces of
software
infrastructure
Today we have
developers and publishers
unprecedented opportunities to connect
communities to the language resources they need
the individuals who
use and create language resources are looking
for three things data tools and advice By
data we mean any information that documents
or describes a language such as a published
monograph
a computer data le or even
a shoebox full of hand-written index cards
The information could range in content from
unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed
and annotated texts to a complete descriptive
We can observe that

from here
creating
facilitate
resources that
such as fonts
By tools we mean computational
grammar
resources
viewing
querying or otherwise using language data
Tools include not just software programs but
also the digital
the programs
depend on
stylesheets and
document type denitions By advice we mean
any information about what data sources are
reliable what tools are appropriate in a given
situation what practices to follow when creating
new data and so forth eg
the Corpora List
archives httpwwwhituibnocorpora
In the context of OLAC
the term language
resource is broadly construed to include all three
of these data tools and advice
Unfortunately todays user does not have ready
access to the resources that are needed Figure 1
offers a diagrammatic view of this reality Some
archives eg Archive 1 do have a site on the
internet which the user is able to nd so the
resources of that archive are accessible Other
archives eg Archive 2 are on the internet so
the user could access them in theory but the user
has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in
practice Still other archives eg Archive 3 are
not even on the internet And there are potentially
hundreds of archives eg Archive n that the user
needs to know about Tools and advice are out
there as well but are at many different sites
For instance
There are many other problems inherent in the
current situation
the user may
not be able to nd all the existing data about a
language of interest because different sites have
called it by different names low recall The
user may be swamped with irrelevant resources
because search terms have important meanings in
other domains low precision The user may not
be able to use an accessible data le for lack of
being able to match it with the right tools The
user may locate advice that seems relevant but
have no basis for judging its merits
As web-indexing technologies improve one
might hope that a general-purpose search engine
should be sufcient to bridge the gap between
people and the resources they need However
this is a vain hope
First many language
resources such as audio les and software are
not text-based Second many language names
have several variants and these various strings
regularly denote things other than languages
Third much of the material is notand will never
bedocumented in free prose on the web In place
of traditional web-indexing two new initiatives
provide the necessary infrastructure for language
resource discovery
The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative began in
1995 to develop conventions for resource discov-
ery on the web dublincoreorg The Dublin
Core metadata elements represent a broad inter-
disciplinary consensus about the core set of ele-
ments that are likely to be widely useful to sup-
port resource discovery The Dublin Core con-
sists of 15 metadata elements where each ele-
ment is optional and repeatable Title Creator Sub-
ject Description Publisher Contributor Date Type
Format Identier Source Language Relation Cov-
erage and Rights This set can be used to describe
resources that exist in digital or traditional for-
The Open Archives
Initiative OAI was
launched in October 1999 to provide a common
framework across electronic preprint archives
and it has since been broadened to include digital
repositories of scholarly materials regardless of
their type1 To implement the OAI infrastructure
an archive must comply with two standards the
OAI Shared Metadata Set Dublin Core which
facilitates interoperability across all repositories
participating in the OAI and the OAI Metadata
Harvesting Protocol which allows software

Figure 2 A Service Provider Accessing Multiple
Data Providers
services
requests
to query a repository using HTTP
OAI archives are called data providers
and typically have a submission procedure a
long-term storage system and a mechanism
permitting users to obtain materials from the
archive An OAI service provider provides
end-user servicessuch as search functions over
union catalogsbased on metadata harvested
from one or more data providers
Figure 2
illustrates a single service provider accessing
three data providers using the OAI metadata
harvesting protocol End-users only interact with
service providers
The OAI
infrastructure has the bottom-up
distributed character of the web while simulta-
neously having the efcient structured nature
of a centralized database This combination is
well-suited to the language resource community
where the available data is growing rapidly and
where a large user-base is fairly consistent in
how it describes its resource needs
OAI data providers may support metadata stan-
dards in addition to the Dublin Core Thus a
specialist community like the language resources
community can dene a metadata format tailored
to its domain Using the OAI infrastructure the
communitys archives can be federated a vir-
tual meta-archive collects all the information into
a single place and end-users can query multiple
archives simultaneously
In the case of OLAC
the Linguistic Data Consortium has harvested the
catalogs of ten participating archives and created
a search interface which permits queries over all
9000 records A single search typically returns
records from multiple archives The prototype
can be accessed via wwwlanguage-archives
2 A Core Metadata Set for Language
Resources
The OLAC Metadata Set extends the Dublin
Core set only to the minimum degree required
to express those basic properties of language
resources which are useful as nding aids All
fteen Dublin Core elements are used in the
OLAC Metadata Set In order to suit the specic
needs of the language resources community
the elements have been qualied following
principles articulated in Dublin Core Qualiers
DCMI 2000 and explained below This section
lists the OLAC metadata elements and controlled
vocabularies
Full details are available from
wwwlanguage-archivesorg
21 Metadata attributes
Three attributes  rene code and lang  are used
throughout the metadata set to handle most qual-
ications to Dublin Core Some elements in the
OLAC Metadata Set use the rene attribute to iden-
tify element renements These qualiers make
the meaning of an element narrower or more spe-
cic A rened element shares the meaning of the
unqualied element but with a more restricted
scope DCMI 2000
Some elements in the OLAC Metadata Set use
the code attribute to hold metadata values that are
taken from a specic encoding scheme When an
element may take this attribute the attribute value
species a precise value for the element taken
from a controlled vocabulary or formal notation
23
In such cases the element content may
also be used to specify a free-form elaboration of
the coded value
Every element in the OLAC Metadata Set may
use the lang attribute
It species the language
in which the text in the content of the element
is written The value for the attribute comes
from a controlled vocabulary OLAC-Language
By default the lang attribute has the value en
for English Whenever the language of the
element content is other than English the lang
attribute should be used to identify the language
By using multiple instances of the metadata
elements tagged for different
languages data
providers may offer their metadata records in
multiple languages Service providers may use
this information in order to offer multilingual
views of the metadata
22 The elements of the OLAC Metadata Set
In this section we present a synopsis of the
elements of the OLAC metadata set
elements

These are parenthesized and
discussed later Each element is optional and
repeatable

Observe that some elements such as Format
Formatencoding and Formatmarkup are applicable
to software as well as to data Service providers
can exploit this feature to match data with appro-
priate software tools
23 The controlled vocabularies
Controlled vocabularies are enumerations of
legal values for the code and rene attributes
and are currently undergoing development
some cases more than one value applies and the
corresponding element must be repeated once
for each applicable value In other cases no value
is applicable and the corresponding element is
simply omitted In yet other cases the controlled
vocabulary may fail to provide a suitable item
in which case the most similar vocabulary item
can be optionally specied and a prose comment
included in the element content
OLAC-Language A vocabulary for identifying
the languages that the data is in or that a
piece of linguistic description is about or
that a particular tool can process
OLAC-Linguistic-Type The primary linguistic
descriptors
resource
transcription annotation description and lexicon
with subcodes for each type
language
OLAC-CPU A vocabulary for identifying the
CPUs for which the software is available
in the case of binary distributions x86 mips
alpha ppc sparc 680x0
OLAC-Encoding A vocabulary for identifying
the character encoding used by a digital
resource eg iso-8859-1 
textsf
OLAC-Format A vocabulary for identifying
the manifestation of the resource
representation is inspired by MIME types
for SIL standard format
Formatmarkup is used to identify the
particular tagset
It may be necessary
to add new types and subtypes to cover
non-digital holdings such as manuscripts
microforms and so forth and we expect
to be able to incorporate an existing
vocabulary
OLAC-Functionality A vocabulary for clas-
sifying the functionality of software again
using the MIME style of representation
and using the HLT Survey as a source of
categories Cole 1997 as advocated by
the ACLDFKI Natural Language Software
Registry For example writtenOCR would
cover written language input print or
handwriting optical character recognition
OLAC-OS A vocabulary for identifying the
operating systems for which the software
is available Unix MacOS OS2 MSDOS
MSWindows Each of these has optional
subtypes eg UnixLinux MSWindowswinNT
OLAC-Rights A vocabulary for classifying
the rights held over a resource eg open
restricted 
OLAC-Role A vocabulary
identifying
the role of a contributor or creator of the
resource eg
translator
transcriber sponsor 
author editor
OLAC-Software-Rights A vocabulary
classifying the rights held over a resource
eg open-source royalty-free-library royalty-
free-binary commercial 
OLAC-Sourcecode A vocabulary for identify-
ing the programming languages used by
software which is distributed in source form
eg C Java Python Tcl VB 
Issues for the Asian Language
Resources Community
knowledge
comprehensive
Language identication is probably the most
fundamental kind of information that can be
given to any language resource Simons 2000
The most
for language identication is the Ethnologue
Grimes 2000 an online searchable database
which has been built up over fty years The
Ethnologue database contains
of information for each language
a unique
three-letter code the country where this language
is spoken alternative names dialects language
classication comments and references to the
SIL bibliography This section discusses a variety
of issues relating to language identication and
to the specication of the languages covered
by multilingual resources We believe these are
two key issues for the Asian language resources
community
several
Issues with language identication
In order to identify and catalog a language it is
crucial to dene what counts as a language and to
distinguish languages from dialects The editors
of the Ethnologue have made thousands of such
decisions using advice from hundreds of experts
around the world However for many languages
scholarship remains patchy or else there is schol-
arly disagreement
In such cases the best that
the Ethnologue can do is what it does already
represent incomplete knowledge and then pro-
duce periodic updates to reect the results of new
research
As OLAC grows Ethnologue codes will be
deployed widely Each new OLAC-conformant
archive will be faced with a range of issues
in seeking to associate language codes with
language resources
For concreteness we
have chosen for our examples the Formosan
languages a group of Austronesian languages
spoken in Taiwan We put ourselves in the shoes
of the eld research group at Academia Sinica
Elizabeth Zeitoun personal communication
and try to envisage the problems which they
might encounter in assigning Ethnologue codes
to their language resources
We see three broad categories of problem
over-chunking and omission
over-splitting
Over-splitting occurs when a language variety
is treated as a distinct language For example
Nataoran is given its own language code AIS
even though the scholars at Academia Sinica
consider it to be a dialect of Amis ALV Over-
chunking occurs when two distinct
languages
are treated as dialects of a single language there
does not appear to be an example of this in the
Ethnologues treatment of Formosan languages
Omission occurs when a language is not listed
For example
languages Luilang
and Quaquat are not listed in the Ethnologue
Another kind of omission problem occurs when
the language is actually listed but
the name
by which the archivist knows it is not listed
whether as a primary name or an alternate name
In such a case the archivist cannot make the
match to assign the proper code For instance
the language listed as Taroko TRV in the
Ethnologue is known as Seediq by the Academia
Sinica several of the alternate names listed by
the Ethnologue are similar but none matches
exactly
two extinct
Beyond these three problems with language
identication a further type of problem concerns
for most
language family
scholarly disagreement over
classication
The Ethnologue follows the
Oxford International Encyclopedia of Linguistics
Bright 1992
language families
For the Austronesian languages
including the
Formosan languages the Ethnologue follows the
Comparative Austronesian Dictionary Tryon
1994 Additionally some changes have been
entered in the light of more recent comparative
studies2 Academia Sinica has developed its
own language
family classication scheme
for Formosan languages and this differs from
the EthnologueTryon scheme
Additionally
languages typically have many variant names
and scholars may disagree on the choice
of a canonical name for the language
example the Academia Sinica scholars believe
Taroko to be a variant of Seediq while the
EthnologueTryon would presumably consider
Seediq to be a variant of Taroko
The consequences of these problems for clas-
sication and retrieval are obvious In the case of
over-splitting as with AIS and ALV mentioned
above someone searching for Amis resources
will need to know to search over both codes An
archivist cataloging a resource which is ambigu-
ous with respect to the AISALV distinction per-
haps because it was created by someone who did
not believe in the distinction may need to assign
both codes
In the case of over-chunking an
archivist cannot specify the individual language
but must use a code which designates two or more
languages Someone searching for resources in
one of those languages will experience lower pre-
cision In the case of omission no language code
can be assigned and classication and search
must fall back to using conventional string rep-
resentations for language names with the atten-
dant precision and recall problems In the case of
differing language family classications the pre-
cision and recall of searches on language family
names are reduced
All of these problems can be addressed through
existing Ethnologue mechanisms3 However
OLAC metadata and service providers could offer
complementary remedies
Controlling element content The Language
Subjectlanguage

comethnodocsquestionnairesasp
language code to be specied in the code attribute
while the element content
is unrestricted A
community of Formosan scholars could develop
a controlled vocabulary for identifying speech
varieties down to any level of detail they liked
and then use those terms as the content of
the Language or Subjectlanguage element For
example the following are ve varieties of the
Bunun language
language codex-sil-BNNNorthernTakituduh
language codex-sil-BNNNorthernTakibakha
language codex-sil-BNNCentralTakbanuaz
language codex-sil-BNNCentralTakivatan
language codex-sil-BNNSouthernIsbukun
If no Ethnologue
code corresponded to
the group of languages in question as in the
AmisNataoran case the code attribute could be
omitted though this would prevent recall on the
Ethnologue code This general approach could
be formalized by permitting subcommunities
to register an encoding scheme as a controlled
vocabulary with a unique name That name
would be specied as the value of a new scheme
attribute and the element content would be
constrained to be an item from the corresponding
vocabulary These approaches would address the
problems of over-chunking and omission
Registering language groups with an OLAC
registration service While the classication
of a language is sometimes treated as metadata
for resources in that language we believe that a
more appropriate location for this type of nding
aid is in OLAC service providers OLAC could
maintain a language classication server which
would house a comprehensive list of language
family names and their extensional denitions
ie sets of Ethnologue codes The server would
permit users to dene their own language group
names or their own versions of existing group
For instance Academia Sinica could
register a language group name ASAmis with the
extension ALV AIS Searching on their notion
of Amis would return resources classied
under both codes Entire classication schemes
with complex hierarchies could be represented in
this fashion OLAC service providers could index
their harvested metadata using these names
allowing any user to perform searches using
any classication scheme Over time the more
respected and popular classications could be
identied and accorded due prominence This
mechanism would address
the problems of
over-splitting and differing classication
Issues with multilingual resources
For many language resources it is necessary to
identify more than one language In some cases
such as MT systems and bilingual lexicons there
is an added complication namely directionality
Someone looking for such a resource will usually
want to specify source andor target languages
For example
in searching for a Korean-to-
English resource
the user would not usually
be interested in discovering English-to-Korean
resources Thus there is an a priori need for
resources to be described using ordered pairs of
languages
OLAC provides some mechanisms which can
be applied to these cases First OLAC meta-
data elements are repeatable eg a system which
can process multiple languages will be described
using multiple Subjectlanguage elements one per
language Second OLAC incorporates direction-
ality in its distinction between Language and Sub-
jectlanguage Are these simple mechanisms ade-
quate for the convenient and accurate description
and discovery of multilingual resources In this
section we enumerate the main types of multilin-
gual resource and show how OLAC metadata can
be used to classify them We report some prob-
lems and discuss possible solutions
Machine Translation Systems
The simplest type of MT system is a unidirec-
tional system which translates language S to lan-
guage T  Here the intended audience of such a
system is assumed to be the speakers of language
T who use the system to access documents in
another language S The OLAC solution would
be to designate S as the Subjectlanguage and T as
the Language
Note that audience is slightly problematic
Such an MT system may be intended for an audi-
ence of S speakers who wish to translate their
documents into language T  The problem here
is not with directionality but with the notion of
audience in the OLAC denition of Language
The denition could be adjusted to remove this
problem
Next in order of complexity is the bidirectional
case where a system translates in both directions
between languages X and Y  Extending the pre-
vious solution we would designate both X and
Y as Language and Subjectlanguage Ideally we
would use order or structure to group the lan-
guages appropriately
pairSubjectlanguage code X
Language code Ypair
pairSubjectlanguage code Y
Language code Xpair
However OLAC metadata is at and unordered
The only available options are permutations of the
following in which we can make no contrastive
use of order
Language code X
Language code Y
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
Although this loses information we do not
believe it presents a problem for typical kinds of
retrieval Queries for an MT system i from X
ii from Y  iii to X iv to Y  v from X to
Y  or vi from Y to X will discover the system
described above
Next are MT systems which translate from
one language into many or from many languages
into one star congurations Here the obvious
approach is adequate
One-to-many
Subjectlanguage code S
Language code T1
Language code T2
Language code T3
Many-to-one
Subjectlanguage code S1
Subjectlanguage code S2
Subjectlanguage code S3
Language code T
Finally
there are MT systems which trans-
late from and to all languages in a set of n lan-
guages Here again the obvious approach is ade-
quate and is clearly superior to a solution where
all nn  1 ordered pairs are enumerated
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
Subjectlanguage code Z
Language code X
Language code Y
Language code Z
Multilingual Lexicons
A unidirectional bilingual lexicon with lem-
mas in language S and denitions in language
T is described like a unidirectional MT system
The OLAC solution is to designate S as the Sub-
jectlanguage and T as the Language A fully bidi-
rectional lexicon intended for use by speakers of
either language would be described in the same
fashion as a bidirectional MT system
Language code X
Language code Y
Subjectlanguage code X
Subjectlanguage code Y
As before this solution has lost some struc-
ture but retrieval behavior is correct nonetheless
Of course
this metadata could equally be the
collection-level metadata for a set of two mono-
lingual dictionaries one in language X and one in
language Y  However the Typelinguistic element
would distinguish these cases by having different
vocabulary items for monolingual and bilingual
lexicons
lexicons may also exhibit star
Multilingual
congurations
one-to-many lexicons with
denitions in multiple languages or many-to-
one comparative wordlists Here the treatment
is analogous to the corresponding MT systems
discussed above
Finally multilingual
lexicons may map
between all pairs of a set of languages as in the
case of some termbanks
In this case all the
languages are designated both using Language
and Subjectlanguage
Text Collections
The most simple case of a text collection is a
set of texts in a single language Usually the
language in these texts would be described using
the Language element However in the situa-
tion where the text collection is intended to doc-
ument a language then it is simultaneously in
and about that language Accordingly it would
be tempting to describe this with both the Lan-
guage and Subjectlanguage elements Rather than
let the decision about metadata depend on the
intent of the creator of the resource which may
not be known or on the typical usage of the
resource which may change through time we
think it would be simplest to describe such sit-
uations using the Language element only This
approach generalizes to the case of a text col-
lection spanning multiple languages eg where
each text comes from one of the Formosan lan-
guages Here collection-level metadata would
provide a Language element for each language
represented in the collection
In the case of bilingual aligned texts bitexts
there is normally a directionality since one of
the texts is primary and the other is a translation
Here we specify the primary language using Sub-
jectlanguage and the translation using Language
A complication arises when the texts or bitexts
employ analytical notations For a text in lan-
guage X transcribed in a notation such as the
International Phonetic Alphabet which is inac-
cessible to speakers of X assuming any exist it
would make sense to use Subjectlanguage instead
of Language The situation becomes more vexing
for texts with embedded annotations such as the
notation of Conversation Analysis where non-
specialists could discard the annotations to get
a conventional text Here the use of both Sub-
jectlanguage and Language seems to be indicated
Descriptions
The nal category we consider is linguistic
descriptions such as eld notes and grammars
In the usual case the language described is spec-
ied with Subjectlanguage while the language of
the commentary is specied with Language One
interesting case is where a third language is used
for elicitation For example a sentence from
Amis may have been elicited using a sentence
from Chinese and both sentences may have been
entered in the eld notes Next commentary in
the language of the linguist such as English may
have been added In this case we would say that
the eld notes include bitext and the languages
of the bitext would be described in the usual way
The audience language of the eld notes would
also be specied Using OLACs at metadata we
would specify the languages as follows
Subjectlanguage codex-sil-AIS
Language codex-sil-CFR
Language codex-sil-ENG
We believe this is perfectly adequate for
the majority of retrieval purposes
If it were
necessary to represent
structure more
accurately two OLAC records could be associated
with the same resource one describing the
eld notes as a whole with the above language
designations and one describing the bitext
content with just the AIS and CFR designations
The different linguistic types would be expressed
using the Typelinguistic element and the two
records could refer
to each other using the
Relation element

4 Conclusions
This paper has presented the leading ideas of the
Open Language Archives Community OLAC
along with its metadata set and controlled vocabu-
laries Language resources exhibit great diversity
and include all types of data tools and advice
As collections of language resources proliferate
OLAC will make it maximally easy for mem-
bers of the language resources community to dis-
cover each others resources Another dimen-
sion of OLAC not discussed here will permit
community-agreed best practices to be identied
greatly facilitating resource re-use
Members of the Asian language resources
community are encouraged to join OLAC and
contribute to the development of OLAC metadata
vocabularies and archives
