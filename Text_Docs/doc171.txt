Conference Highlights
The Outer Edges of Dwarf Irregular Galaxies Stars and Gas1
Introduction
The outer edges of dwarf irregular galaxies have been an area of interest for about 40 years
Its origin can be traced back at least to Sandages 1962 discussion of the outer parts of IC
1613 which on Baades deep red photographic plates showed an envelope of faint red stars that
extended outwards signicantly beyond the main parts of the galaxy Scattered reports of the
properties of other dwarf galaxies followed at a low rate until the recent work of Hunter and her
collaborators highlighted the importance of the edges of irregular galaxies both because of their
importance in illuminating the evolution of the galaxies and because of the sensitivity of their
properties to the nature of the intergalactic medium Recent research in this area has ourished
as the Workshop clearly demonstrated
2 The Outer Gas
Distribution Eric Wilcots pointed out that dwarf irregular galaxies can have three dierent
types of HI envelopes which were described as extended smooth extended chaotic and starless
clumps For example the HI outer envelope of IC 10 has a very extended clumpy counter-rotating
structure involving a possibly infalling gas cloud of 107 M 
David Strickland showed some results from detailed feedback models of SN-produced outows
mostly for larger disk galaxies but he included a discussion of the shell-like structures in the outer
excited gas of NGC 1569 Sally Oey described her calculations showing how ionizing photons
escape from irregular galaxy disks demonstrating how the rate of escape depends on the porosity
of the interstellar medium
The outer gas in galaxies sometimes includes bridges between galaxy pairs and some
interesting new results for the Magellanic bridge was presented by Erik Muller The western part
of the bridge has been mapped at high resolution and is found to have a chaotic and lamentary
structure There are 163 HI shells similar to those in the SMC but on average smaller and less
energetic Eon-Chang Sung et al showed what may the largest HI bridge of all a 130 kpc-long
bridge between two Blue Compact Dwarf BCD irregulars

Sylvie Beaulieu described the detection of HI in the outer parts of two dSph galaxies in
nearby groups and Daniela Calzetti described the ionized gas in starburst galaxies
In a report on some remarkably deep searches for CO in the outer parts of irregular galaxies
Fabian Walter showed that the outer parts of some are rich in molecules For example IC 10
has several clouds in distant regions as well as in the center Its H2 mass is  106 M and the
conversion factor is like the Galactic value
Stephanie Cote reviewed recent results on the distribution of dark matter in dIm galaxies
based on Fabry-Perot 2-d velocity elds showing that they are dark matter dominated
Abundances Do dwarf irregular galaxies have abundance gradients such that the outer
edges are even lower in metals abundance than the central areas The answer to this question
was touched on by a few talks and posters but there was more new information regarding the
abundances in irregulars in general especially with relation to the question of their possible
primordial nature Starburst irregulars were featured in two such studies Daniela Calzetti showed
results of HST narrow-band imaging which provided line ratios in four starbursters Alessandra
Aloisi revealed the results of FUSE spectra of IZw18 which allowed analysis of lines of Fe Ar Si
O N C P and H She revealed the fact that the abundances of species are ten times lower in HI
regions than in HII regions The data best t multi-burst models the gas is not primordial and
IZw18 is not in its rst starburst
3 The Outer Stars
Distribution Deidre Hunter reported on the distribution of the outer stars in two irregular
galaxies detecting stellar light down to values as faint as 29 magnitudes per square second There
is no edge yet Yutaka Komiyama showed some surprising results based on a wideeld camera
attached to the Suburu telescope He found that the distribution of the outer stars in NGC
6822 goes far beyond the traditional borders of the optical image and is similar in distribution
and extent to HI distribution Ralf-Jurgen Dettmar used very deep images of disk galaxies
to demonstrate that the apparent edges are actually not cut-os but demarcate a steeper
exponential distribution of starlight Studying many irregular galaxies Igor Drozdovsky concluded
that most are thick disks
Star Formation Histories An exhaustive review by Carme Gallart included the fact that
the outer parts of irregular dwarfs are dominated by an older population but also an intermediate
population extends far from the center She showed recent remarkable new LMC data that
support this Sebastian Hidalgo demonstrated the fact that the Phoenix dwarf has a smooth
gradient of age outward Ted Wyder reporting on an HST study of NGC 6822 showed detailed
star formation histories for ve regions across the bar of the galaxy including two outer areas All
showed star formation at all times since formation though the outer areas had relatively lower
recent activity levels Arna Karick reported on a survey of the irregular dwarfs in the Fornax
 3 
cluster with the intriguing suggestion that star formation activity is preferentially located on the
leading edges of some of the galaxies which are presumably falling into the cluster
Inside the outer edges Patricia Knezek reported on a study of three extreme Cen A
Group dwarfs Vincent McIntyre showed some impressive HI maps of NGC 4214s HI shells Some
of the outer ones have star formation at their edges In Caroline Simpson and collaborators study
of DDO 88 it was found that the galaxy has an inner HI ring neither expanding or contracting
while the object is otherwise a normal irregular galaxy Janice Lee did an analysis of a sample of
H-selected dwarfs which provided an HI mass function for galaxies the rst of its type Jan
Palous developed expanding shell models and determined the mass spectrum of shell fragments
Javier Alonso-Garca showed HST results for two contrasting dwarfs in the M81 group one with
a mixture of old and young stars and one with only old or intermediate age stars Violet Taylor
measured color gradients in 100 irregular and peculiar galaxies nding that most are redder in
their outer regions in agreement with results from CM diagrams of nearer Irr galaxies Matthew
Walker showed the results of measurements of over 200 stars in and in the direction of the Fornax
dwarf galaxy not an irregular at the present but in the past Membership is demonstrated for
160 stars according to their radial velocities the velocity prole is nearly at
Formation and Evolution In deriving a model for the formation of low mass irregular
galaxies  108 M  Massimo Ricotti calculated the eects of radiative feedback in the early
universe his simulations agree with many of the observed properties of dwarfs
theoretical analyses Gerhard Hensler described extensive results from chemodynamical models
including such items as formation star formation self- regulation chemical peculiarities mixing
time scale and infall of gas Stephen Murray reported on numerical simulations of dwarfs forming
near a massive galaxy In related simulations carried out by Chris Fragile it was shown that
the degree of enrichment by supernovae depends on the smoothness of the ISM if the ISM is
porous most of the enriched gas is lost from the galaxy core Arif Babul nicely demonstrated
how increasingly-complete modeling is showing details of dwarf galaxy evolution including how
SN-driven outows from dwarfs can pollute the IGM Sergey Mashchenko demonstrated a model
for dwarf galaxies in which the UV radiation from spirals ionizes the ISM of orbiting dwarfs
cycling through plane of the spiral causing periodic star formation episodes
In related
Blue Compact Dwarfs BCD galaxies as a class were examined in detail by several
attendees Walter Koprolin reported that an old stellar population could be detected underlying
the brighter young component The structure of this underlying population was described by
Nicola Caon who said that most can be t to an exponential law including Mrk 35 though two
in his sample could not Finally Eon-Chang Sung and his collaborators searched BCD galaxies
for new super-star clusters and found several of these highly-luminous young products of rampant
star formation

4 Related Issues
Spiral Galaxies Very deep HI maps of 10 spiral galaxy edges were described by Thijs van
der Hulst who concluded that UV metagalactic radiation may ionize the outer gas but current
simple models need renement Annette Ferguson analyzed the outer disks of spirals nding them
to be surprisingly metal-rich and 510 Gyr old She showed some faint M31 star counts that cover
30 square degrees and show structure at remarkably large distances Rene Walterbos reported
on a study of HII regions in M81s outer disk including some in the vast M81 HI envelope The
abundances correlate with distance from M81s center Stephen Odewahn reported on UV-optical
colors of a large sample of galaxies including analysis of the star formation history distributions
Martin Bureau modeled NGC 2915s starless outer spiral structure
Low Surface Brightness Galaxies In a survey of Low Surface Brightness LSB galaxies
Gaspar Galaz and colleagues found that in general the star formation rate is low and there exist
both color and age gradients all have an old component and some show bulges in K-band images
Michael Pohlen and R-J Dettmar investigated the structure of LSB spirals including UGC 7321
nding that they have the same structure as normal surface brightness galaxies except for the
depressed overall brightness levels
In other related elds Lyle Homan and Ed Salpeter reported on the discovery of 104 M
mini-HVCs while Jay Lockman also using the new GBT described the discovery that the
Galactic halo HI is resolved into clouds J OBrien showed an unusual galaxy that has a bar in
a non-nucleated pure disk Andrew Odell demonstrated the eectiveness of a intemediate-band
photometry of galaxies mostly ellipticals in clusters for determining ages and metallicities
Finally Javier Alonso-Garca reported the excellent news that the rst RR Lyrae variables have
now been detected in the elliptical companion of M31 M32
5 Concluding Discussion Session
The Workshop ended with a lively interchange on several topics that had been raised during
the course of the meeting The rst question put before the attendees was To what extent have
the stars in the far outer regions of dwarf irregular galaxies formed there and to what extent have
they migrated there from inner regions of the galaxy Discussion concluded that on the one
hand the rotation of the galaxy makes it dicult to move stars radially outward On the other
hand such motions are easier if the gravitational potential has been disturbed A change in the
potential can occur if the galaxy is perturbed by galaxy interactions or depending on the dark
matter content if an extreme starburst results in the gas being blown out of the center and into
the outer parts
But could stars form out there Observational evidence suggests that models for the
formation of gas clouds due to gravitational instabilities in the disk fail in irregulars generally
 5 
and especially so in the outer parts It was suggested that the thermal phase of the gas might
be more important but such models also generally fail for dIm disks It was suggested that gas
disk instabilities suggested to explain the formation of holes seen in the outer HI disks of some
irregulars could result in interstices with higher column densities that might be able to form stars
Another idea was that the outer gas could be for whatever reason in gas clouds too small to
be detected in current interferometric observations and stars might be forming without massive
stars so that star-forming regions are not detectable in current H surveys Since some extended
HI disks around irregulars are found to be highly structured and others are very smooth it was
suggested that there might be a dierence in the star formation in the outer regions of these two
sets of galaxies Perhaps this dierence could be seen in the surface brightness prole or the colors
in the extreme outer parts of the galaxies
The second question posed was What are the parallels between the outer parts of spirals
and irregulars and between these regions and LSB galaxies The outer parts of spirals are still
more metal-rich than most irregulars While magnetic pressure may dominate the ISM pressure
in the outer parts of spirals less is known about the magnetic eld in irregulars Spirals also show
a strong decrease in the fraction of cold neutral medium vs warm neutral medium outside the
star-forming disk We were reminded that spirals have more shear due to dierential rotation in
their outer parts than do irregulars Azimuthally-averaged surface brightness proles of both LSB
and dIm galaxies show a break in the slope with the outer parts declining in surface brightness
more steeply than the inner parts the cause of this break is not known The outer parts of both
spirals and irregulars show low-density gas with faint populations of old and intermediate-age
A third question that was raised was Is there any real evidence for signicant accretion onto
galactic disks Accretion is predicted by cosmological and chemical evolution models and is
proposed as the source of X-ray emission around galactic halos IC 10 for example is interacting
with a gas cloud that is believed to be falling into it High velocity clouds are seen around
our Galaxy but massive ones have not been found around other galaxies The X-ray emission
convincingly appears to result from massive star feedback The participants were hard pressed to
think of solid observational evidence for signicant external accretion
