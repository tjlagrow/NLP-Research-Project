the observing time to multi-wavelength cosmological surveys of dierent depths
in various low-background sky regions Several tens of thousand mid-IR galaxies
have been detected over a wide interval of redshifts A progressively clearer pic-
ture of galaxy evolution is emerging which emphasizes populations of luminous
galaxies at z  1 likely corresponding to the main phases of stellar formation and
galaxy assembly These results are entirely consistent with previous outcomes
from ISO SCUBA and COBE observations and provide valuable constraints of
high statistical and photometric precision We briey report here on our attempt
to extract from statistical data some general properties of galaxy evolution and
describe evidence that a population of very luminous objects at z  15 share
dierent properties from those of starbursts at lower redshifts indicating some
seemingly anti-hierarchical behavior of galaxy evolution in the IR We warn
however that these results are based on large still uncertain extrapolations of
the observed mid-IR to bolometric uxes for measuring which the forthcoming
far-IR and submillimetre Herschel Space Observatory will be needed We nally
comment based on our present understanding about Herschel capabilities for
investigating the early phases of galaxy evolution
Introduction
The interest of long wavelength observations for cosmological studies was raised
20 years ago by the IRAS mission showing the most luminous local galaxies to
emit the bulk of their radiant energy in the far-IR due to dust reprocessing eg
Soifer et al 1988 Sanders et al 1988 Ten years later the ISO mission has
found rst evidence for strong evolution of dust-enshrouded starbursts between
z  0 and z  1 Franceschini et al 2001 Elbaz et al 2002 Genzel 
Cesarsky 2003 Together with parallel ndings in the sub-mm with SCUBA
eg Blain et al 2002 and with COBE Hauser et al 1998 these results
have established the relevance of long wavelength studies for our understanding
of galaxy formation Franceschini et al 2003 Baugh et al 2005 a major
fraction of the emission by the most massive luminous and short-lived stars
when they are still embedded inside their parent dusty molecular clouds is
optically extinguished and reprocessed at IR to sub-mm wavelengths
With the advent of the Spitzer Space Telescope the exploration of the dis-
tant universe at IR wavelengths has become possible with similar sensitivities
and spatial to some extent also spectral resolutions typical of optical searches
with large ground-based telescopes Spitzer exploits a battery of sensitive de-
tectors from   3 to 70 m Rieke et al 2004 while its performance at longer

wavelengths is limited by telescope diraction The 24 m band of the MIPS
imager in particular detects the 8 m PAH bundle emission to z  2 for the
rst time Thanks to all this the observatory has identied large samples of
star-forming galaxies and IR-emitting active galactic nuclei over wide redshift
intervals Perez-Gonzales et al 2005 Le Floch et al 2005 Rowan-Robinson et
al 2005 Caputi et al 2006 Babbedge et al 2006 Dole et al 2006
Early attempts to constrain galaxy evolution based on Spitzer observations
have made use of the identications of large samples of faint 24 m sources with
Spitzer IRAC near-IR data allowing a good characterization of the galaxy SED
and photometric redshifts In particular a 06 deg2 region of the CDFS was
observed at 24 m by Le Floch et al 2005 and a sample of 2600 galaxies
brighter than 80 J y was combined with existing optical COMBO17 data in
the eld and used to derive bolometric IR luminosity functions and SFRs from
z0 to  1 These results imply a comoving IR energy density in the Universe to
evolve proportionally to 1z3904 to z  1 From MIPS 24 m observations of
the CDFS and HDFN combined with a systematic photometric redshift analysis
using the Spitzer IRAC data Perez-Gonzales et al 2005 derived estimates
of the redshift-dependent galaxy luminosity functions and found that the SFR
density remains roughly constant above z  1
We will follow a dierent approach in the next Sects based on the analysis
of statistical data whose integral nature is less subject to the uncertainties in
the photometric redshifts estimates
2 Statistical Observables
Galaxy number counts in the most sensitive Spitzer MIPS 24 m channel have
been estimated by various teams with surveys at dierent depths Based on data
from the SWIRE survey Lonsdale et al 2004 Rowan-Robinson these Proceed-

on optically selected galaxy samples Line types as in Fig1
ings Shupe et al 2006 have found quite signicant eld-to-eld variations up
to a factor of 2 at bright uxes due to local structure Averaged over the large
areas covered by SWIRE the dierential counts show a sharply non-Euclidean
behavior as in Figure 1 Counts at deeper ux levels wider cosmic volumes in
smaller elds from Papovich et al 2004 and Chary et al 2004 reveal a very
fast convergence At 70 m the bright galaxy counts are from SWIRE Afonso-
Luis et al 2006 while the deeper ones from Frayer et al 2006 Fig 1 right
panel and similarly for the 160 m data
Another critical constraint is oered by the observed redshift distribu-
tions from complete 24 m galaxy samples Earlier estimates were reported
by Perez-Gonzalez et al and Caputi et al
2005 based on a sample in
CDFS ux-limited to 83 Jy We report in Figure 2 a reassessment of the
z-distribution for galaxies brighter than 100 Jy in the CDFS GOODS area
see httpdataspitzercaltechedupopulargoods including some new spec-
troscopic redshifts and our own estimate of photometric redshifts As previously
mentioned in Caputi et al the observed distribution broken continuous line
reveals a bimodality likely due to the eect of strong PAH emission features in
the typical source SEDs convolved with the MIPS channel transmission function
Additional relevant data further constraining galaxy evolution come from
the SCUBA number counts and redshift distributions from the COBE back-
ground intensity and from the IRAS local luminosity functions among others
 and Model Analyses
This large dataset poses a serious challenge to any attempts to explain it with
simple evolutionary prescriptions Previous models Franceschini et al 2001
Figure 3
Simulated outcome of deep galaxy surveys at 170 m that will be
carried out in the Herschel PACS and SPIRE Guaranteed Time The expected
bolometric IR luminosity of the detected galaxies are plotted as a function of
z colors correspond to galaxy populations dened in previous gures
Xu et al 2004 Pozzi et al 2004 have tried to t the ISO and IRAS data by
combining the contributions of moderately-evolving local spirals with that of a
fast evolving population of dusty starbursts with evolution rates independent
of luminosity
We have found that this minimal scheme is ruled out by the combination
of the Spitzer 24 m and SCUBA data The extremely narrow peak at uxes
of 03 mJy in the galaxy dierential counts Fig1 requires a population of
moderately luminous starbursts with maximum comoving IR emissivity around
z  1 and a fast decline at higher-z Such evolutionary rate is illustrated as the
cyan line in the right panel of Fig2 where the bolometric emissivity is expressed
in equivalent SFR density Contributions to the various statistics by this class
of sources are reported as cyan lines in Figs1 and 2
The fast decrease of this population at z  1 implies that these objects
cannot explain the secondary peak at z  2 in the redshift distribution of 24 m
sources and are essentially unrelated with the high-z sub-millimetric SCUBA
population An additional component of very high luminosity starburst galaxies
ULIRGs very rare locally but numerous and dominating the emissivity at
z  15 is then required red dashed lines in Fig1 and 2
Altogether the combined set of IR data reveal clear evidence for down-
sizing in galaxy evolution the high luminosity starburst population Fig2 right
evolved faster at decreasing redshift and was active at earlier cosmic times
z  15 compared to the lower-luminosity objects forming stars for a more
prolonged time and whose main evolutionary phases peak around z  1 This

areas and depths See also the previous g
evidence based on IR data see also Caputi et al 2006 agrees with a variety of
independent analyses eg Cowie et al 1996 and is particularly strong because
of the constraint imposed by the spectral intensity of the far-IR background
4 The Herschel Perspective
Our results on galaxy evolution as summarized in the right panel of Fig2 are
based on large extrapolations of the observed mid-IR and sub-mm to bolomet-
ric uxes In spite of some eorts to calibrate these relations eg Elbaz et al
2002 they are still subject to large uncertainties
A major progress is then expected from the forthcoming far-IR and sub-
millimetric Herschel Space Observatory mission that thanks to the substantial
improvement in telescope size and to the correspondingly lower confusion noise
will allow us to obtain extensive characterization of the IR to sub-mm SEDs of
large samples of high-z galaxies The programs for cosmological surveys in the
PACS and SPIRE instrument Guaranteed Times are discussed by Grin and
Poglitsch these Proceedings We exploit here our multi-wavelength IR model
to predict some of the outcomes of such observations
Figures 3 4 and 5 illustrate the expected bolometric luminosity vs redshift
plots of surveys in various areas to dierent depths performed at 170 250 and
350 m The apparent stripes correspond to dierent areas and sensitivity limits
of the GT survey program and the eects of K-correction are also evident in
decreasing the slope of the Lz correlation at increasing wavelengths In con-
clusion already within the GT program the Herschel mission will ensure wide

coverage of the galaxy far-IR luminosity functions at z  15 and an excellent
characterization of the high luminousity end at higher-z
