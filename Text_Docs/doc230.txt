ABSTRACT
Studying how nuclear star clusters NSCs form and how they are related to the growth of the
central massive black holes MBHs and their host galaxies is fundamental for our understanding of
the evolution of galaxies and the processes that have shaped their central structures We present the
results of a semi-analytical galaxy formation model that follows the evolution of dark matter halos
along merger trees as well as that of the baryonic components This model allows us to study the
evolution of NSCs in a cosmological context by taking into account the growth of NSCs due to both
dynamical friction-driven migration of stellar clusters and star formation triggered by infalling gas
while also accounting for dynamical heating from binary MBHs We nd that in-situ star formation
contributes a signicant fraction up to  80  of the total mass of NSCs in our model Both
NSC growth through in-situ star formation and through star cluster migration are found to generate
NSC  host galaxy scaling correlations that are shallower than the same correlations for MBHs We
explore the role of galaxy mergers on the evolution of NSCs and show that observational data on
NSC  host galaxy scaling relations provide evidence of partial erosion of NSCs by MBH binaries
in luminous galaxies We show that this observational feature is reproduced by our models and we
make predictions about the NSC and MBH occupation fraction in galaxies We conclude by discussing
several implications for theories of NSC formation

1 INTRODUCTION
Over the past two decades high-resolution observa-
tions with the Hubble space telescope have shown that
massive stellar clusters reside at the photometric and
dynamical centers of most intermediate and low lumi-
nosity galaxies of all Hubble types Carollo et al 1998
Matthews et al 1999 Boker et al 2002 Balcells et al
2003 Graham  Guzman 2003 Cote et al 2006 With
sizes in the range 2 to 10 pc and masses in the range
105 to 108 M these nuclear clusters NCs have cen-
tral densities up to  1067 M pc3 making them
the densest stellar systems observed eg Phillips et al
1996 Walcher et al 2005
NSCs are observed to be larger and brighter and to
follow dierent structural scaling relations than globular
clusters The NSC half light radii scale with their total
mass roughly as rh  M 05
NSC while globular clusters have
rh  3 pc irrespective of their luminosity albeit with a
large scatter Harris 1996 However the NSC mass
distribution overlaps with that of globular clusters at its
low mass end suggesting a possible connection between
the two types of stellar clusters eg Cote et al 2006
Turner et al 2012
in dierent environments

NSCs have been studied in detail
for large sam-
ples of galaxies
servational work has

fraction of galaxies is similar for galaxies belong-
ing to very dierent environments
including the
Virgo Fornax and Coma clusters as well as galax-
ies in the eld Cote et al 2006 Turner et al 2012
den Brok et al 2014 Baldassare et al 2014 On aver-
age 80 of all galaxies of all Hubble types with mag-
nitude in the range 20  MB  12 contain a well
dened central cluster Hence NSCs appear to be ubiq-
uitous structures in galaxies although they tend to be
missing in galaxies brighter than magnitude MB  20
and fainter than MB  12 eg van den Bergh 1986
Cote et al 2006 The real nucleated fraction could be
however larger than the value constrained from obser-
vations given that the morphological complexity and
high surface brightness often characterizing the center of
galaxies can make NSCs dicult to identify especially
in massive spheroids
High resolution spectroscopic surveys have been used
to place constraints on NSC ages and star forma-
tion histories Walcher et al 2006 Rossa et al 2006
Bender et al 2005 The common nding emerging from
these studies is that NSCs are characterized by a complex
star formation history with a mixture of morphological
components and dierent stellar populations spanning a
wide range of characteristic ages from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr
Cluster ages and masses are also found to depend on
the host galaxy Hubble type with NSCs in early-type
spirals being older and more massive than those of late-
type spirals The luminosity-weighted ages of NSCs are
typically smaller than the ages of host galactic disks in-
dicating that the growth of the nuclei is a continuous and
ongoing process occurring during and after most of the
host galaxy was formed Rossa et al 2006
Age estimates for most NSCs remain however suscep-
tible to large uncertainties due to the fact that the light
Antonini Barausse and Silk
is often dominated by young stellar populations while at
the same time the mass is dominated by the old stars
The inability to infer spectroscopically the age of old
cluster components can introduce a bias toward younger
ages The bulk of the stellar population is typically found
in an older and spatially more extended stellar compo-
nent Carson et al 2015 This appears to be the case
for the Milky Way in which more than  80  of the
stars inside the inner parsec formed more than 5 Gyr ago
while luminous massive stars dominate the central clus-
ter light within  05pc Bender et al 2005 Pfuhl et al
2011 Yusef-Zadeh et al 2012 Lauer et al 2012
NSC old and young stellar populations also dier mor-
phologically Seth et al 2006 showed that the three
edge-on late-type galaxies IC 5052 NGC 4206 and NGC
4244 have nuclei that are strongly attened along the
plane of their host galaxy disks Such NSCs show ev-
idence for young stellar components distributed onto a
disk-like or ring structure superimposed on an older more
spherical component In the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC
4244 old and young stellar components both show clear
signs of rotation Seth et al 2008a Seth et al 2006
suggested that the presence of such multiple rotating
morphological components and the presence of a at-
tened young cluster aligned with the major axis of the
host galaxy point toward an in situ build up of nuclear
clusters whereby stars form episodically in compact nu-
clear disks and then lose angular momentum or heat
vertically to form an older spheroidal structure It has
been noted however that both rotation and the pres-
ence of young structural components does not exclude
other formation mechanisms such as for example episodic
accretion of young star clusters in the central part of
the galaxy due to dynamical friction Antonini 2014
In the case of NGC 4244 for example it is likely that
accreation of star clusters has contributed at least in
part to the growth of its NSC Hartmann et al 2011
De Lorenzi et al 2013
Since the early studies it has been realized that NSC
masses correlate fairly well with galaxy properties such as
bulge velocity dispersion bulge and galaxy total luminos-
ity Balcells et al 2003 Boker et al 2004 Rossa et al
2006 The existence of such correlations suggests that
the formation of NSCs is intimately connected to the for-
mation and evolution of the host galaxy eg Leigh et al
2015 Given that NSCs and MBHs are found to coexist
in some galaxies that in these systems they have com-
parable masses and that both follow tight correlations
with galaxy properties it is also natural to ask whether
NSCs and MBHs are somehow connected to each other
NSCs and MBHs are known to co-exist in galax-
ies with masses  1010 M Seth et al 2008a
Gonzalez Delgado et al 2008 galaxies with masses
lower than this value show clear evidence for nu-
cleation but little evidence for a MBH Conversely
galaxies with masses above  1011 M are dom-
inated by MBHs but show no evidence for nucle-
ation eg Wehner  Harris 2006 Neumayer  Walcher
2012 Ferrarese et al 2006a found that the nuclei and
MBHs obey a similar scaling relation linking their mass
to the virial mass of the host galaxy More recently
Graham 2012 obtained NSC  host galaxy correla-
tions using a sample in which he excluded what were
likely to be nuclear stellar discs from the galaxy sam-
ple of Ferrarese et al while including an additional 13
NSCs in galaxies with velocity dispersions out to about
200 kms Graham found that NSC and MBH masses
follow dierent scaling correlations with host galaxy
properties Other authors conrmed this result show-
ing that the mass of NSCs scales with the host-galaxy
spheroids velocity dispersion as MNSC  2 while the
mass of MBHs follows the much steeper relation MMBH

2012 Scott  Graham 2013 Kormendy  Ho 2013
den Brok et al 2014 Although this might suggest that
MBHs and NSCs did not form from the same mecha-
nism Antonini 2013 whether the formation of MBHs
is connected to the evolution of NSCs and whether the
two types of central objects grow together or in compe-
tition from the same physical process remains unclear
The observational ndings mentioned above provided
motivation for theoretical work aimed to understand how
NSCs form and how their evolution is linked to the evo-
lution of their host galaxy Two models have been sug-
gested for the formation of NSCs i the cluster infall
scenario in which stellar clusters are driven to the galac-
tic nucleus by dynamical friction merge and build up
a NSC Tremaine et al 1975 ii The nuclear star for-
mation scenario in which gas falls into the nucleus and
forms stars eg Milosavljevic 2004 McLaughlin et al
2006 Due to the inherent complexity of gas dynamics
in star formation which makes the second of these two
processes dicult to model theoretical work has been
mostly directed toward the cluster infall scenario but
see Aharon  Perets 2015 However both dissipative
and dissipationless processes are likely to play an impor-
tant role in NSC formation Antonini et al 2015
Theoretical
obvious diculties
eg Bekki et al
studies have employed two dierent
methodologies N -body simulations and semi-analytical
modeling N -body techniques are used to simulate
the last stage of inspiral and merger of stellar clus-
ters in the inner region of galaxies These models
have shown that a star cluster merger scenario can

properties of NSCs

2014 While these studies make reliable predictions
about the aspect of NSCs they suer from the fact
that the adopted initial conditions are often not well
motivated hence the need to rely on semi-analytical
models These are used to make predictions for the
appearance of star clusters of known mass and radius in
the center of galaxies and to compute the accumulated
mass at the center through dynamical friction migration
over a Hubble time In semi-analytical models the rate
at which the NSC grows by accreting young clusters
is estimated from empirical cluster formation rates
dynamical friction timescales and dissolution times eg
Agarwal  Milosavljevic
Arca-Sedda  Capuzzo-Dolcetta 2014 Studies based
on semi-analytical approaches have demonstrated that
the NSC host galaxy property scaling relations and
their half-mass radius  mass relation are both consistent
with formation by star cluster accretion Antonini 2013
All previous calculations assumed NSC formation to
take place in isolated galactic spheroids thus neglect-

formation of galactic nuclei
ing the role of galaxy evolution mergers and the role
of in-situ star formation Also these former idealized
attempts could not explore the details of the interplay
between MBH and NSC evolution
In this paper we
present a semi-analytical galaxy-formation model that
allows us to shed light on exactly these points ie it al-
lows us to assess the role of galaxy mergers MBH merg-
ers and nuclear star formation on the growth of NSCs
We follow the formation and evolution of galaxies MBHs
and NSCs along cosmic history including the growth of
NSCs due to both central migration of stellar clusters
and in-situ star formation while also accounting for dy-
namical heating from binary MBHs
The paper is organized as follows
In Section 2 we
introduce and discuss the numerical methods employed
in our study Section 3 describes the sample data to
which our numerical results are compared In Sections 4
and 5 we describe the main results of our calculations
and discuss some of their implications in Section 6 We
summarize in Section 7
2 SEMI-ANALYTICAL MODELS
We study the formation of NSCs and their co-evolution
with MBHs along the merger history of their host galax-
ies by semianalytical techniques
First we consider a purely dissipationless formation
model in which stellar clusters form and migrate to the
center of a galaxy through dynamical friction We also
consider a second semi-analytical model which unlike the
rst follows the formation and merger history of galaxies
both in their Dark-Matter and baryonic components
This allows us to study the formation evolution and dis-
ruption of NSCs in a self-consistent way accounting not
only for the dynamical friction-driven inspiral of stellar
clusters to the nucleus but also for star formation in
the nuclear gas and for the eect of galaxy and MBH
mergers
We begin in this section by describing our methodol-
ogy highlighting in particular the simplifying approxi-
mations that are made in our models
21 Cluster inspiral model CliN
In our semi-analytical model CliN a galactic nucleus
forms through the orbital decay via dynamical friction
and merger of star clusters in the central region of a
galaxy This code adopts a rather idealized model of
an isolated galactic spheroid and follows the consecutive
inspiral of stellar clusters along their orbits until they
decay into the galactic center or they are disrupted in
the process This relatively simple approach has the ad-
vantage that the details of the tidal interaction of the
clusters with the background galaxy and central MBH
are easily included and in a relatively precise manner
On the other hand as previously stated this model has
the important limitation that galaxy evolution as well
as dissipative processes that can lead to star formation
episodes in the galactic center are neglected Another ba-
sic assumption made in the CliN model is that MBHs are
already in place before NSCs grow around them more-
over we assume that all galaxies contain initially a MBH
The code is essentially the same as that used by
Antonini 2013 and we direct the reader to that pa-
per for a more detailed description Briey we represent
the galaxy spheroid by a simple power-law density model
r  0 rr0 where 0  3  Msph4r3
0 This
latter expression assumes that the density of the galac-
tic bulge follows a Dehnen 1993 prole r  r4  at
r  r0 Given a mass for the central MBH MMBH we
compute the galaxy density prole slope scale radius
spheroidal mass and galaxy velocity dispersion by using
the corresponding scaling relations that link these prop-
erties to MMBH Gultekin et al 2009 Graham 2012b
Graham  Driver 2007 The galaxy eective radius
Re was derived from the size-mass relation given by
equation 32 of Shen et al 2003 The ratio Re r0
follows from equations 4 and 17 of Dehnen 1993
which give Re r0  18 15 1 for   1 15 2
We assign the stellar cluster masses using the clus-
ter initial mass function CIMF dndmgc  m2
Bik et al 2003 de Grijs et al 2003 and limiting
mass values of mmin  102M mmax  107M The
stellar clusters are assumed to form continuously over
the age of the galaxy
As commonly done we assume that the clusters have
initially the same distribution as the stars in the galaxy
and that initially a xed fraction fgc  005 of stars
form in strongly bound stellar clusters This latter is ap-
proximately consistent with the typical cluster formation
eciency for the Milky Way found by Kruijssen 2012
and it is similar to the value adopted in previous stud-
ies Gnedin et al 2014 Gnedin et al showed that by
adopting a power-law mass function dndmgc  m2
and a fraction fgc  004 of clustered star formation one
can reproduce the observed density prole of clusters in
We assume that the central properties of a stellar clus-
ter remain unchanged during inspiral and that rt  rK 
where rK is the cluster core radius and rt is the cluster
tidal limiting radius given by King 1962
rt  
K2cid18 3
dr  4Gcid1912
with  the sum of galactic MBH and NSC potentials
and  a form factor that depends on the density dis-
tribution within the cluster The mass of a King model
is then related to its tidal radius and velocity dispersion
via the expression
Gmgc 
We note that although at rst order the central prop-
erties of the clusters are not expected to change during
inspiral the stars in a NSC formed from cluster infalls
should arguably end up with the same root-mean-square
velocity as the galaxy host which appears to be consis-
tent with observations see Leigh et al 2015
Given a cluster of central velocity dispersion K  the
time evolution of its orbital radius is

Fig 1 Schematic representation of the model of Barausse 2012 in black including the improvements described in Sesana et al
2014 with the additions described in this paper in red to model the formation and evolution of NSCs
clusters due to their collisional evolution and interaction
with the external tidal eld of the galaxy by only evolv-
ing clusters with dynamical friction time shorter than
their dissolution time equation 11 below
The cluster orbits are evolved using equation 3 up
to a maximum integration time of 10Gyr and the NSC
mass is obtained by summing up all the mass transported
by the infalling clusters within a radius rNSC The NSC
radius rNSC
is computed from the recursive relation
given by equations 14-16 of Antonini 2013 As we
evolve the cluster orbits we compute their tidal disrup-
tion radius due to the galaxy MBH and a pre-existing
NSC gravitational elds adopting a cluster core radius
rK  1pc roughly equal to the median value of the core
radii listed in the Harris compilation of Galactic star
clusters Harris 1996 When the clusters reach their
tidal disruption radius the remaining core mass is dis-
persed around the radius of disruption When evaluat-
ing the nal NSC density distribution we make the as-
sumption that the stars from the disrupted clusters are
isotropically distributed around the center We note that
in reality the clusters will distribute initially in a disk-
like structure but this will morph into a more spheri-
cal distribution over a fraction of the nuclear relaxation
timescale Antonini 2014
A MBH binary formed during a galaxy merger leaves
an imprint on the galactic nucleus in the form of a
mass decit Mejbin a decrease in the mass of the
nucleus due to ejection of stars on intersecting or-
bits Bekki  Graham 2010 We account for this by
subtracting a mass Mejbin  05  NmMMBH Merritt
2006 where Nm is the predicted number of major merg-
ers after the last major accretion event from the nal ac-
cumulated mass inside rNSC The number of mergers Nm
is obtained from the galaxy mass using the distributions
shown in Figure 2 of Haehnelt  Kaumann 2002
where in order to convert V luminosity to mass we used
a constant mass-to-light ratio MLV  3ML as
sometimes adopted in the literature for an old stellar
population eg Gnedin et al 2014
Finally we compare the resulting NSC density prole
obtained after 10 Gyr of evolution to the density prole
r of the galaxy and dene a galaxy as nucleated if
at some radius the NSC stellar density was found to be
formation of galactic nuclei
higher than that of the background galaxy This latter
condition is based on the fact that if the NSC densities
are below the galaxy density at all radii then it would
be dicult to observationally distinguish the two com-
ponents
22 Galaxy-formation model GxeV
Our galaxy formation model hereafter GxeV  is based
on that of Barausse 2012 which was further im-
proved in Sesana et al 2014 More precisely Barausse
2012 presented a semi-analytical galaxy formation
model tracking the evolution of baryonic structures
along Dark Matter merger trees These trees are pro-
duced with an extended Press-Schechter formalism mod-
ied in order to reproduce the results of N-body sim-
ulations of Dark-Matter halos Parkinson et al 2008
while the baryonic structures include the hot
largely
unprocessed intergalactic medium galactic disks and
spheroids in both their stellar and cold chemically-
enriched interstellar medium components a low angu-
lar momentum reservoir of cold nuclear gas available for
accretion onto the central MBH Granato et al 2004
Lapi et al 2014 and the MBH itself These baryonic
components are interconnected by a plethora of interac-
tions schematically summarized in Figure 1 Also in-
cluded are environmental and tidal interactions between
galaxies during mergers following simple semi-analytical
recipes Taoni et al 2003 Boylan-Kolchin et al 2008
Moreover Sesana et al
improved this
model by rening the star formation law  adding
in particular an explicit dependence on the metallic-
ity Krumholz et al 2009 as well as a distinction be-
tween pseudo-bulges forming from bar instabilities and
classical bulges created by major mergers  and by devis-
ing more realistic prescriptions for the evolution of the
spins of MBHs with cosmic time
For this work we have further ameliorated the model
by including the formation and evolution of NSCs cf
Figure 1 More precisely we consider two possible for-
mation channels for these objects namely one where
NSCs form from the dynamical friction-driven migration
to the nuclear regions of star clusters created further out
in the galaxy and one in which NSCs form in situ as
a result of star formation in the nuclear regions Note
that we assume no high redshift seeds for the NSCs ie
the NSC mass grows from zero at high redshifts to its
present-day value through the two aforementioned chan-
nels this growth being modulatedhindered by the eect
of galaxy and black-hole mergers cf section 223
In the GxeV models described below we dene as nu-
cleated any galaxy containing a central cluster more mas-
sive than 104 M as this value corresponds approxi-
mately to the lower limit of the observed NSC mass dis-
tribution eg den Brok et al 2014 We also dene an
early- late-type galaxy as one with bulge to total mass
ratio BT  07  07 For each of the GxeV models
that we present we simulate about 1300 galaxies with
Dark-Matter masses ranging from 1010M to 1015M
221 Migration channel
To implement the dynamical friction-driven migra-
tion of star clusters to the central nucleus we rst as-
sume that star clusters are created during star-formation
events with eciency fgc both in galactic bulges and
In bulges Barausse 2012 and Sesana et al
2014 assumed a volumetric star-formation rate 
while in disks they considered a vertically-averaged rate
of star formation  Therefore we assume that star
clusters form in bulges and disks and that the total
mass of the star-cluster population in both the bulge
and disk Mgc changes with rate
formation  fgc cid184Z r2dr  2Z rdrcid19  4
where we choose fgc  007 which is the typical value in
the Milky Way Kruijssen 2012 We stress that plausi-
ble values fgc  005  02 would only mildly impact the
normalization of our results for the MNSC   relation
and would not aect its slope signicantly In addition
we have tried a model with a variable fgc set to 007 004
and 05 in disk quiescent and starburst galaxies respec-
tively these correspond approximately to the values of
Figure 4 in Kruijssen 2012 The results of this model
were found to not signicantly dier from those of mod-
els with a xed fgc Thus for the sake of simplicity we
present in what follows only the results of a model with
xed fgc  007
We then assume that the star clusters formed in the
bulge are spatially distributed in the same way as the
bulge stellar population
if that population has
density prole 
bulger the volumetric number density
of star clusters is assumed to satisfy
r 
N bulge
bulger
where N bulge
is the total number of star clusters in the
bulge and M 
bulge is the total bulge mass in stars Note
that following Barausse 2012 we assume a Hernquist
distribution for 
bulger we refer to Barausse 2012 for
more details on the choice of the scaling radius for this
density prole
Similarly we assume that the disks star clusters are
distributed according to the same surface density prole
as the overall stellar content of the disk ie the super-
cial number density disk
gc r will satisfy
gc r 
diskr
where again N disk
is the total number of star clusters in
the disk and M 
disk is the mass of the stellar disk Again
for 
diskr we follow Barausse 2012 and adopt an ex-
ponential prole see Barausse 2012 for more details on
the calculation of the scaling radius for this distribution
As for the mass distribution of the newly formed
star clusters we assume a power-law mass function
2 with X  bulge disk Combined
with equations 5 and 6 this gives the distribution

Note that our models do not include the possibility of
close encounters with giant molecular clouds which in
some cases could signicantly reduce the clusters life-
time Also they rely on necessarily simplied models for
the galaxy A more realistic model for the galactic po-
tential might somewhat change the timescales introduced
above However we note that analytical models of NSC
formation indicate that the nal NSC mass is not much
aected by the assumed slope of the galactic background
density prole see Section 4 of Antonini 2013
The total mass in star clusters also decreases because
the individual star clusters fall toward the central NSC
under the eect of dynamical friction ie
where dV and dS are units of volume and surface We
assume that these distribution functions are valid for
masses mgc for individual star clusters between mmin 
102M and mmax  106  107M and the normalization
mmax mmin
mmax  mmin
ensures that the integral over all masses and over the
whole volume or surface is 1 Note that in our runs we
assume mmax  107M using the dissipationless model
described in Section 21 we nd that reducing mmax to
106M has the eect of changing the normalization of
the scaling relations by a factor  10 but did not change
their overall slopes
These distribution functions can then be used to cal-
culate approximately how much mass is lost by the pop-
ulation of star clusters due to their collisional evolution
and interaction with the external tidal eld of the galaxy

ter of mass mcl belonging to the disk and thus moving

that for  we follow Kregel et al 2005 and assume
  029Vmax where Vmax is the maximum rotational
velocity inside the disk Also observe that in equation
18 we are summing the inverses of the timescales so
that the infall rates due to the dynamical friction from
the gas and that due to the stars get summed in equation
Not all of the mass of the star clusters falling toward
the NSC eventually accretes onto it because star clusters
get truncated due to the galactic tidal eld and tidally
disrupted by the central MBH To account for these ef-
fects we assume that the rate of change of the NSC mass
due to infall of star clusters is
M NSC

infallF 
where clearly the major diculty lies in computing the
factor 0  F  1 Since it would be computationally pro-
hibitive to evolve the infall of the individual star clusters
self-consistently within our semi-analytical galaxy forma-
tion model we calculate F with the monolithic CliN
model of Section 21 in order to derive an easy-to-use
analytical expression
More specically approximating a star cluster as a
King model its tidal radius at a distance rNSC from the
center of a galaxy containing a MBH and a NSC at its
center is

where MCMO  MMBH  MNSC is the total mass of the
central massive objects ie MBH plus NSC mass and
for the galaxy density prole we adopted the power-law
model r  0 rr0 Note that to be consistent
with the Hernquist prole used in GxeV  we set   1 in
equation 22 Also the distance rNSC is to be set to the
outer radius of the NSC ie the distance from the galaxy
center below which the star cluster is assumed to have
become part of the NSC We assume rNSC  5rh where
rh is the NSC half-mass radius Our detailed prescrip-
tion for rh will be presented in equation 25 below For
a King model the truncated mass mgcK  of the star
cluster is then related to its tidal radius via equation 2
Using the CliN model described in Section 21 we
nd that more than 90 of the NSC mass comes from
star clusters with initial mass  01mmax and that the
mass-weighted mean central velocity dispersion of the
star clusters contributing to the nucleus growth is hKi 
20 kms When setting mmax  107 M the average
initial mass of these star clusters is hmgc ini  25 
106M Assuming that all star clusters that decay to
the center have similar central properties K  and that
these properties do not change during the infall we have
mgchKi
hmgc ini
where mgchKi is given by equations 2 and 22 Fi-
nally to account for the possibility that a star cluster
may undergo complete tidal disruption before it decays
to a radius rNSC we compare the tidal radius given by
equation 22 with the core radius rK  1 pc of the star
cluster If rt  rK  we set F  0
222 Star-formation channel
As mentioned above NSCs may also form by star
formation in the cold gas accumulating in the galac-
tic center
In the galaxy formation model of Barausse
2012 and in the improved version of this model used
by Sesana et al 2014 transfer of cold gas to a low-
angular momentum nuclear reservoir  available for ac-
cretion onto the central MBH  is assumed to be cor-
related with star-formation events in the galactic bulge
through a relation Granato et al 2004 Lapi et al 2014
Haiman et al 2004
M res
infall  Aresb 
where b is the star formation rate in the gaseous
bulge and Ares  102  103 is a free parameter
which we set to Ares  6  103 in this paper as in
Sesana et al 2014 In the model of Barausse 2012
and Sesana et al 2014 star formation in the bulge is
associated with major galactic mergers and less impor-
tantly with bar instabilities in the galactic disk
Note that the physical mechanism responsible for the
loss of angular momentum of the cold gas and its
transfer to this nuclear reservoir may be the radiation
drag caused by the newly formed stars Umemura 2001
Kawakatu  Umemura 2002 Kawakatu et al 2003 or
the reshuingshocks of the gas as a consequence of disk
instabilities or mergers More generally a correlation be-
tween bulge star formation and MBH accretiongrowth
is expected based on the M  relation for MBHs and on
the parallelism between the quasar luminosity and star
formation history Granato et al 2004 Lapi et al 2014
Haiman et al 2004
The reservoirs gas is then made available to accrete
onto the MBH on the viscous timescale Whenever
the resulting viscous accretion rate exceeds AEdd MEdd
 MEdd being the Eddington mass accretion rate and
AEdd a free parameter we truncate the accretion rate
to that value To allow for moderately super-Eddington
accretion in the case in which MBHs form from light
popIII star seeds of mass  200M at z  15 
20 Madau  Rees 2001 we set AEdd  22 for that
seed model This is because some amount of super-
Eddington accretion is known to be needed to recon-
cile light MBH seeds with the quasar luminosity function
at high redshift Madau et al 2014 We also consider
two heavy seed models namely that of Volonteri et al
2008 and that of Koushiappas et al 2004 whereby
MBHs grow from seeds of  105M at z  15  20 in
which case we set AEdd  1
On top of these prescriptions in this paper we assume
that the gas in the nuclear reservoir also forms stars
Antonini Barausse and Silk
which are assumed to contribute to the NSC To com-
pute the star-formation rate we need to choose a size
for the reservoir It is natural to assume that this size is
comparable to the observed size of NSCs More speci-
cally we assume that the reservoir is disk-like and has a
vertically-averaged exponential density prole whose
scale radius we choose such that the reservoir has the
same half-mass radius rh as the NSC The latter is as-
sumed to be
rh  3 pc max s Mdyn
106M
with Mdyn  Mres  MNSC the dynamical mass of the
nucleus including the gas in the nuclear region Note
that this scaling is inspired by observations of the size of
NSCs which is found to scale with the square root of the
luminosity Turner et al 2012
Once a density prole for the reservoir is specied
we apply a star formation law similar to that used
by Sesana et al 2014 for galactic disks Note that
Sesana et al 2014 improved on Barausse 2012 by con-
sidering dierent modes of star formation in classical
bulges forming from major mergers  where star forma-
tion is assumed to take place in bursts of duration
comparable to the bulge dynamical time  as opposed
to disks and pseudobulges arising from bar-instabilities
of disks  where star formation is assumed to happen
in a quiescent mode described by the prescription of
Krumholz et al 2009 Since star formation in the cen-
tral region of our Galaxy is known to be weaker by at
least a factor ten relative to what would be expected
based on the observed gas densities Kruijssen et al
2014 it seems more appropriate to use the quiescent
star-formation mode for our nuclear reservoir1 Follow-
ing therefore Sesana et al 2014 and Krumholz et al
2009 we assume that the star formation in the reser-
voir takes place on a timescale tSF and involves only a
fraction fc of the reservoirs gas thus allowing us to write
an approximate star formation rate in the reservoir as
Note that this simple prescription does not account for
the spatial distribution of the star formation activity eg
the observational fact that younger stellar components
seem to be more centrally concentrated than the rest of
the NSC see for example Georgiev  Boker 2014
The fraction fc of cold gas available for star formation
is set by the fraction of molecular gas for metallicities
Z   001 in solar units when star-formation happens
in molecular clouds At lower metallicities Z   001
star formation takes place in the atomic phase Krumholz
2012 In general fc is expected to decrease as the metal-
licity decreases but recent observations of nearby spirals
and dwarfs Bigiel et al 2010 as well as the Small Mag-
ellanic Cloud Bolatto et al 2011 show that it levels o
at 2 Genzel et al 2015
1 Observe that although star formation takes place quiescently
in our models nuclear reservoir we also assume cf equation 24
that the reservoirs feeding is triggered by star-formation events in
the bulge ie mainly by turbulence-driven bursts of star formation
following major mergers
We can thus summarize the dependence of fc on the
metallicity by the explicit expression Sesana et al 2014

assuming that star formation happens in clouds and
the two branches appear according to whether the cloud
density is determined by internal processes or by the
external pressure in galaxies with suciently high sur-
face densities Also note that the typical cloud mass
does appear in this expression because it is related to
the gas surface density by identifying it with the local
Jeans mass and by assuming marginal gravitational sta-
bility of the reservoir For the surface density of the
reservoir
in both equation 27 and 28 we choose
res  Mres2r2
res rres being the scale radius of the
reservoirs exponential surface density prole This is
the central value of the density for an exponential sur-
face density prole While this choice is quite arbi-
trary we note that at high surface densities the com-
bination fctSF has a weak dependence on res namely
fctSF  034
res  Therefore a dierent choice of res by a
res as given by equation 26
factor 2 5 only changes
by 01 024 dex
We stress that equation 26 is admittedly a rough pre-
scription for the star formation in the nuclear regions
However it seems to work reasonably well when com-
pared to observations of the star formation rates in the
central 500 pc of the Milky Way the central molecular
zone Indeed in Figure 2 we compare the predictions of
our star formation prescription where in equations 27
and 28 we identify res with the surface gas density
represented in the horizontal axis with measurements of
the star formation in the central molecular zone at dier-
ent angular scales and thus dierent average gas surface
densities
In the light of this reasonable agreement we chose not
to include any feedback eects AGNs or supernovae
when considering star formation in the nuclear regions
We stress however that both kinds of feedback are in-
cluded when considering the bulge and disk star forma-
tion cf Figure 1 and Barausse 2012 They therefore
indirectly aect the star formation in the nuclear region

2011 Vasiliev 2014 Vasiliev et al 2014 2015 Ro-
tation in attened galaxy models has also been sug-
gested to help drive MBH binaries to coalescence cf
Holley-Bockelmann  Khan 2015 Also if a MBH bi-
nary stalls at  pc separation a later galaxy merger
may add another MBH to the system forming a MBH
triple At least for large  108M MBH masses triple
MBH interactions may trigger binary mergers and pos-
sibly ejection of the smallest MBH on timescales  108
yr Homan  Loeb 2007 Because of the uncertainty
about the mechanisms described above we adopt here
a set of minimal simplied prescriptions to estimate the
delay between galaxy and MBH mergers These pre-
scriptions are presented in the following
In gas-rich environments dened by the criterion
Mres  MMBH1  MMBH2 we assume that the de-
lay is simply given by the viscous time of the nuclear
gas At a distance r from the central MBH the vis-
cous time is simply t  r2  being the kinematic
viscosity The latter can be approximately expressed in
terms of the gas velocity v and the Reynolds number
R as   rvR Frank et al 2002 Duschl et al 2000
Since the kinematic viscosity is huge for accretion disks
it is natural to assume that R is the critical Reynolds
number Rc  102  103 marking the onset of turbu-
laboratory experiments nd that once
this critical Reynolds number is reached the viscosity
increases signicantly Frank et al 2002 Duschl et al
2000 Assuming now that r  GMMBH1MMBH22
is the binarys inuence radius and that v   we
can write the delay in gas-rich nuclear environments

Indeed

since the feeding of the reservoir depends on the larger-

223 Eect of galaxy mergers and black-hole binaries
Delays between galaxy and black-hole mergers 
When two dark matter halos merge the two galaxies
being more compact than the halos initially retain their
identity and are slowly brought together by dynami-
cal friction During this evolution environmental eects
such as tidal stripping and tidal evaporation become im-
portant and contribute to remove mass from the smaller
galaxy2 When the galaxies nally merge within a few
dynamical-friction time-scales after the halo merger the
MBHs of the two galaxies are expected to form a binary
system
This binary is slowly brought together by a variety
of eects ie dynamical friction at large separations
and at smaller  pc separations by gas interactions if
sucient gas is present in the nuclear regions or by
interaction with stars if the nuclear star cluster has a
suciently dense core or by triaxiality of the central
potential Gas interactions and in particular planet-
like migration might bring a MBH binary to merger on
time-scales  107  108 yr Haiman et al 2009 Colpi
2014 while three-body interactions with stars might re-
quire timescales up to  Gyr Yu 2002 or more
fact it is not completely obvious that a MBH binary
would merge at all within a Hubble time in the pres-
ence of three-body interactions with stars alone This
is known as the nal-parsec problem Begelman et al
1980 but recent numerical simulations suggest that in
triaxial merger remnants such as those that would be
expected from a recent galaxy merger MBH binaries
2 We refer to Barausse 2012 for more details about how we
compute the dynamical-friction timescale and these environmental
eects
Antonini Barausse and Silk
the binary moves is given by the maximum of the
stellar-bulge density and the density of the NSC For
the latter we use the average NSC density within its
half-mass radius
NSC  MNSC  2MMBH1 
MMBH283r3
h where we decrease the mass of the
NSC by twice the mass of the binary to approximately
account for the mass decit it causes on the NSC during
its inspiral cf equation 34 below As for the stellar-
bulge density our model assumes a Hernquist prole
as mentioned earlier Comparisons to N-body simula-
tions Sesana  Khan 2015 show that the appropriate
radius where this density prole needs to be evaluated in
order to estimate agr correctly is the binarys mass inu-
ence radius ie the radius at which the enclosed bulge
mass in stars equals twice the binary mass
In order to model triple MBH systems when they form
we utilize the results of Homan  Loeb 2007 By us-
ing numerical simulations Homan  Loeb 2007 found
that MBH triples typically trigger the merger of the two
more massive components on timescales of 108 yrs on
average for binary masses of  6 108M and roughly
comparable masses for the two components while the
lightest MBH may be ejected from the galaxy or be left
wandering far from the galaxys center or less likely come
back and coalesce with the remnant of the inner binarys
merger Moreover the time-scales for the merger of the
inner binary present a log-normal scatter of about 14 dex
around the median value of 108 yrs as shown in Figure
8 upper panel in Homan  Loeb 2007 To extend
these results to arbitrary masses we rescale these time-
scales with the systems dynamical time at the binarys
hardening radius and we thus obtain an average delay
due to MBH triple interactions given by
cid1914
6  108M
tdelay triple  108 yrcid18 MMBH1  MMBH2
1  q3 
Whenever a triple forms we then extract the delay with
which the two more massive objects merge from a log-
normal distribution centered on this timescale and with
rms of 14 dex For simplicity we also assume that the
lightest MBH is ejected from the galaxy and therefore
lost to the subsequent galaxy evolution
Finally Homan  Loeb 2007 noted that triple
MBH interactions are less eective at driving MBHs to
merger in low-mass systems where the third incoming
MBH is ejected from the galaxy before it can shrink
the inner binary to separations at which gravitational-
wave emission is important
Indeed the escape veloc-
ity from a galaxy scales as the velocity dispersion ie
vesc    M 14 where we dened the mass of the inner
binary M  MMBH1  MMBH2 and we used the Faber-
Jackson relation M  4 The separation agw at which
a MBH binary is driven to coalescence by gravitational-
wave emission within a Hubble time tH can be obtained
from Eq 30 with the replacements agr  agw and
tdelay stars  tH and scales as agw  M 34q14
q  MMBH1MMBH2MMBH1MMBH22 the symmet-
ric mass ratio In order for the third MBH to be able to
shrink the inner binary to the separation agw the veloc-
ity v3 of the third MBH should be lower than vesc when
the binarys separation is agw The energy of the third
q12
MBH can be estimated simply by energy equipartition as
E3  MMBH3v2
3  GMMBH1MMBH2agw from which
one gets v3  M 18q38
 with q3  MMBH3M 
This in turn gives v3vesc  M 18q38
 The nor-
malization of this ratio can be estimated using the results
of Homan  Loeb 2007 who nd vesc  1400 kms
and v3  750 kms for M  6  108M q  14 and
q3  025  03 cf their Figs 5 and 11 thus giving
 q12
vesc  05 
M6  10818
3 M
Therefore whenever this equation gives v3  vesc we
assume that the third MBH is ejected without driv-
ing the merger of the inner binary This implies that
triple MBH interactions become ineective at driving
the merger of binary systems with total mass M 
2  106  q3
Mass decit caused by black-hole binaries  The
presence of a MBH binary has profound eects on the
NSC causing a mass-decit in the central regions of
the galaxy Indeed during the binarys inspiral three-
body interactions with the stars in the nuclear region re-
sult in an exchange of energy between the binary which
becomes more and more bound and the stars to which
large velocities are imparted that are capable of eject-
ing them from the galactic nucleus Also when the
MBH binary nally merges the resulting MBH rem-
nant acquires a kick velocity up to a few thousands
kms due to the anisotropic emission of gravitational
waves Campanelli et al 2007 and this also contributes
to remove stars from the galactic core A similar mass
decit may be caused by the ejection of the lightest MBH
in a triple system
We estimate the mass-ejection rate from the NSC due
to the MBH binarys inspiral as
M insp
ej  MMBH1  MMBH2
07q02  05 ln ahagr
tdelay stars
where q  MMBH2MMBH1  1 is the binarys mass ra-
tio and ah is the the semi-major axis at which the binary
becomes hard ie tightly bound
The rst term in the numerator of equation 34 rep-
resents the mass scoured by the MBH binary before it
becomes hard where we have identied the ejected mass
with the mass decit as dened in Merritt 2006 the
second term represents instead the mass ejected from ah
to agr Merritt 2013 the explicit expressions for ah is
given for instance in Merritt 2013 ie
200 kmscid192
ah  0271  q1cid18 MMBH2
107M cid19cid18
while for agr we utilize equation 31 Also in the de-
nominator of equation 34 we note the presence of the
timescale tdelaystars computed via equations 30 and
31 That timescale accounts for the fact that both
terms in the numerator where computed for MBH bi-
naries in gas-poor environments hence the mass decit
at the numerator should be spread over the timescale
characterizing stellar interactions Of course if the MBH
formation of galactic nuclei
binary lives in a gas-poor enviroment in our model the
inspiral lasts exactly tdelay stars and the nal mass decit
caused by the binary is  MMBH1  MMBH207q02 
05 ln ahagr If the binary evolution is instead driven
by gas interactions or by the formation of a MBH triple
that mass decit is suppressed by a factor respectively
tdelay gastdelay stars or tdelay tripletdelay stars3
In addition to the mass decit caused during the in-
spiral when the MBH binary nally merges the result-
ing MBH remnant acquires a kick which as mentioned
above can further remove mass from the NSC We esti-
mate this mass decit as Gualandris  Merritt 2008
ej  5MMBH1  MMBH2 VkickVesc175 
where Vkick is the recoil velocity of the MBH remnant and
Vesc is the escape velocity from the galactic center The
latter can be easily calculated within our model from the
mass and density proles of the bulge and NSC As for
Vkick we follow Barausse 2012 and use the analytical
formula of van Meter et al 2010 which ts the results
of numerical-relativity simulations
Similarly in the case of triple MBH systems if the
lightest MBH gets ejected from the system before it can
cause the inner binary to merge ie in our model if the
ratio v3vesc given by equation 33 is larger than one
we assume that the ejected MBH causes a mass decit
M kick triple
 5MMBH3 with MMBH3 the ejected MBHs
mass We stress that for simplicity we neglect the mass
decit caused by the recoil of the lightest MBH in the
cases in which the triple interactions trigger the merger
of the inner binary ie in our model when v3vesc 
1 Summarizing the total mass decit due to MBH
coalescences is Mej  M insp
ej  M kick triple

In addition to the eect of MBH binaries we also ac-
count for the possible tidal disruption of NSCs by MBHs
during galaxy mergers Indeed if a merger takes place
between a galaxy 1 that contains a NSC but not
a MBH and another galaxy 2 hosting a MBH and
possibly a NSC the NSC of galaxy 1 will be dragged
by dynamical friction toward the MBH and NSC if
present of galaxy 2 and will therefore be tidally trun-
cateddisrupted as in the case of star clusters falling
toward the nucleus of an isolated galaxy To model this
eect we assume that the NSC resulting from such a
galaxy merger has mass
MNSC  MNSC 1  F  MNSC 2 
The fraction 0  F  1 accounts for the tidal trunca-
tiondisruption eects and is calculated via equations
2 22 and 23 with K taken to be the velocity dis-
persion of NSC 1 which one can compute in terms
of its mass and size Note that calculating F in the
same way as for star clusters is justied at least to rst
approximation
Indeed as mentioned earlier the star
clusters that contribute the most to equation 23 have
3 Note that we have also tried setting the delays between galaxy
and MBH mergers to very small values tdelay  106 yr irrespec-
tive of the mechanism driving the binarys evolution prior to the
gravitational-wave dominated phase In this case the mass decit
is always  MMBH1  MMBH207q02  05 ln ahagr This
test conrms that our results for the NSC evolution are reason-
ably robust and that the overall conclusions of this paper do not
depend on our particular model for the delays
average initial mass hmgc ini  25  106M which is of
the same order of magnitude as a typical NSC mass As
in the case of star clusters if rt  rK  rNSC 1
c with
c  30 a typical NSC concentration parameter we as-
sume that NSC 1 is fully disrupted and set F  0
On the other hand if both galaxy 1 and galaxy 2
have MBHs we assume that the gravitational eld of
each massive BH protects its NSC from tidal truncation
and disruption and we set F  1 Similarly if neither
galaxy contains a MBH we set F  1
3 DATA SAMPLE
We compare our models to observational data in order
to gain insights on the reliability of such models We
then use our models to put constraints on the origin and
evolution of NSCs and to understand how their proper-
ties are linked to the evolution of MBHs and their host
galaxies
Our sample of NSC objects was obtained by combin-
ing data from Scott  Graham 2013 Erwin  Gadotti
2012 Neumayer  Walcher 2012 and by estimating
NSC object masses of the galaxies in the Fornax cluster
catalog of Turner et al 2012
Erwin  Gadotti 2012 give mass estimates for a total
of 18 galaxies that cover Hubble types from S0 to Sm with
dynamically determined NSC masses and 15 Sa and later
type galaxies from Rossa et al 2006 with NSC mass es-
timates based on high-resolution spectroscopy Velocity
dispersions for 9 of these galaxies were obtained from Ta-
ble 2 of Neumayer  Walcher 2012 the rest from the
HyperLeda database when available Scott  Graham
2013 constructed their sample of NSCs using photo-
metric data from Ferrarese et al 2006a Balcells et al
2007 Graham  Spitler 2009 and Graham 2012b
Table 1 of Scott  Graham 2013 reports 76 galaxies
containing a NSC with a well determined mass and total
mass and velocity dispersion estimates for the majority of
these The uncertainties on the nuclear object masses are
given by Ferrarese et al 2006a Balcells et al 2007
and Graham  Spitler 2009 as 45 33 and a factor
of two respectively
We additionally obtained estimates for the stellar
masses of the full galaxy Mgx and the NSC using the
photometric data for the 43 early-type galaxies in the
Fornax cluster catalog of Turner et al 2012 To de-
termine Mgx we multiplied the total galaxy luminos-
ity in the K band given in the HyperLeda database by
a mass to light ratio of MLK  08 Bell  de Jong
2001 based on the typical colors of the bulge pop-
ulation Galaxy total B-magnitudes MB and veloc-
ity dispersions  were also taken from the HyperLeda
database The NSC masses were obtained by multiplying

After eliminating duplicate galaxies contained in more

the collective sample the mass estimate with the small-

shown as thin black curves
The rst noteworthy point is that the Loess curves
shown in Figure 3 are characterized by a signicant bend-
ing at   100 kms and Mgx  10105M indicating
NSC - host galaxy scaling relations that are at or even
declining for the most luminous galaxies Moreover the
reconstructed variance bands follow the general trend of
the Loess curves indicating that it is unlikely that the
non-linear features present in the curves are due to ran-
dom uctuations in the data alone
We tested whether or not a linear parametrization of
the relations provides an adequate description of the data
by using a F -test to compare the Loess ts to simpler
weighted linear ts Fox 1999 The F tests showed that
the null hypothesis  ie that the bivariate Loess model
yields no improvement in the t over the linear regression
 can be rejected at a high level of signicance For all
three relations investigated here the Loess curves pro-
vide a better description to the data than linear mod-
els at  99 condence level This conrms that the
non-linear features present in the functional dependence
of MNSC on the galaxy properties are likely not due to
noise variability in the data
A complementary view is provided in Figure 4 where
we plot the NSC mass fraction as a function of the total
stellar mass of the host galaxy ie MNSCMgx vs Mgx
Evidently in the low mass regime Mgx  10105 M
the NSC to galaxy mass ratio shows a weaker correlation
with total galaxy mass with Kendalls rank correlation
coecient B  028 and associated probability value
p  006 while in the more massive systems Mgx 
10105M there is a clear and steeper trend with Mgx
in the sense that the NSC mass fraction decreases rapidly
with the galaxy mass This is in contrast with the results
of Scott  Graham 2013 who claimed quite a steep
decrease of the NSC mass ratio based on ts to the entire
sample distribution
We nally note that although our analysis demon-
strates that current data are consistent with a signi-
cant bending of the NSC-host galaxy scaling relations
further observations and analysis combined with theory
will be needed in order to rene our results On the other
hand the broadening of the NSC mass distribution for
the highest luminosity galaxies as well as the presence
of low mass nuclei  106 M in high mass galaxies
Mgx  1011M certainly poses a serious concern for
previous claims of the existence of fundamental correla-
tions between NSC and host galaxy properties More-
over as we show in the following the particular form of
these relations is in agreement with what is expected on
the basis of our semi-analytical models of NSC formation

and host galaxy physical properties In Figure 3 we plot

early lled circles and late open circles type systems
31 Data analysis
In order to investigate the correlation between NSCs
and their host galaxy properties we use a locally-weighted
linear regression model Loess to t non-parametric
curves to the data Cleveland 1979 1988 Loess does
not require one to specify a global function of any form to
t a model to the data as it combines multiple low-order
polynomial regression models in a k-nearest-neighbor-
based metamodel Unlike a more standard simple lin-
ear regression analysis no assumption is made that the
data can be tted by a straight line Loess scatter-plot
smoothing can therefore be used to reveal complex rela-
tionships that could be overlooked with traditional para-
metric estimation strategies The obvious trade-o is
that in general it is not possible to express a Loess model
with a simple mathematical formula
The smoothness of the Loess regression function is de-
termined by the amount of data points used for the lo-
cal ts a quantity controlled by the span parameter 
Here we select an optimal value of  by using the gen-
eralized cross validation criterion GCV Craven 1979
The basic idea is that the optimal representation of the
data is obtained by adopting the smoothing parameter
that minimizes the mean-squared error of the t Golub
1979 Li 1985
The solid thick black curves in Figure 3 are Loess inter-
polations obtained with the optimal smoothing parame-
ters   063 and 071 for MNSC vs  and Mgx respec-
tively The 95 variance bands of the Loess curves are

creting onto the central NSC because of the tidal eld
of the MBH
The galaxy evolution model GxeV produces scaling re-
lations at z  0 that are in remarkably good agreement
with the observed correlations The scatter around the
median value clearly increases at the high mass end of the
NSC distribution A large population of NSCs are pro-
duced at   100kms that are signicantly underweight
with respect to what the same model would predict by
simply extrapolating the scaling correlations and scat-
ter from low Mgx  10105M to high galaxy masses
In the following section we argue that the formation of
such underweight NSCs and consequently the appar-
ent bending of the scaling correlations can be explained
in terms of the interaction of the NSCs with their host
galaxy MBHs
41 The Role of Massive Black Holes
In our semi-analytical models MBHs aect the forma-
tion and evolution of NSCs in two important ways i
the strong tidal eld of the central MBH accelerates the
mass loss from stellar clusters as they enter its sphere
of inuence and eventually disrupts them as they come
closer than a distance rdisr where
disr  0 
After a cluster is disrupted most of its stars are dis-
persed around rdisr which will limit the nuclear den-
sity within this radius Thus a preexisting MBH will
limit the amount of mass that can be transported to
the center by decaying stellar clusters Antonini 2013
As mentioned earlier cf equation 37 a similar ef-
fect applies to a NSC falling toward a central MBH
after a galaxy merger
ii during galaxy mergers
MBH binaries form and harden by ejecting surround-
ing stars Milosavljevic  Merritt 2001 By dynami-
cally heating the NSC a MBH binary will lower the NSC
central stellar density or fully destroy the NSC when
the binarys mass is signicantly larger than the NSC
mass Bekki  Graham 2010 The kick imparted to
the merger remnant by asymmetric emission of gravita-
tional wave radiation will remove additional mass from
the galaxy nucleus Gualandris  Merritt 2008
To demonstrate the role of MBHs in the evolution of
the nuclei we performed additional simulations where
the two dynamical eects due to MBHs mentioned above
were not included Hereafter we refer to these models
as models without MBH heating The blue and red
curves in the middle panels of Figure 3 show the scaling
correlations resulting from such models When compared
to our ducial models upper panels these new integra-
tions produce steeper and signicantly tighter MNSC  
and MNSC Mgx relations This indicates that the break
in the NSC scaling relations for which we found evidence
in the observational data can be attributed to the inter-
action of NSCs with their companion MBHs
Simple arguments can indeed be used to understand
why the break of the NSC scaling relations occurs at
  100kms From equation 38 by requiring rdisr 
rNSC  10 pc and adopting rK  1pc and K 
20 kms we nd that MBHs more massive than roughly
 108M will suppress the further growth of a NSC via
Fig 5 Fraction of NSC to MBH mass as a function of MBH
mass This plot measures the relative importance of the two types
of central objects as one proceeds from NSC-dominated to MBH-
dominated nuclei The points are observational data and represent
galaxies with measured MBH and NSC mass Graham  Spitler
2009 Erwin  Gadotti 2012 The black curve and corresponding
70 and 90 condence bands are obtained through our ducial
galaxy formation model where all the relevant eects described
in Section 22 were included The blue lines correspond to a
model in which the scouring eect of MBH binaries forming during
galaxy mergers was ignored ie we set Mej  0 in these integra-
tions Note how the predictions of the two models start to diverge
at MMBH  108MM where MBHs and NSCs have comparable
masses in the model with Mej  0 at MMBH  108MM MBH
mergers become ecient at eroding the surrounding NSC
Mgx  10105M respectively This appears to be in
good agreement with analytical expectations  Antonini
2013 nds MNSC  107M 50 kms32 adopting
an idealized isothermal sphere galaxy model Similar
scalings and a similar scatter around the median values
are found with the galaxy evolution model GxeV  which
takes into account both cluster inspirals and in-situ star
formation The similarity between the results of the two
models with and without in-situ star formation suggests
that dynamical friction migration of star clusters is a fun-
damental process for the growth of the nuclei However
as we show below in Section 42 dissipative processes
also play an important role contributing a signicant
fraction of the total NSC masses in our models
Figure 3 shows that at   100kms and Mgx 
10105M the scaling relations produced with CliN ie
a purely dissipationless formation model appear to at-
ten toward the most luminous galaxies in agreement with
the results of the data analysis of Section 3 However
a more careful analysis of the plot also shows that such
a model fails to explain the existence of NSCs of mass
 108M which are clearly present in the observational
data The reason for this discrepancy is that in CliN
we have assumed that all galaxies contain a MBH and
that these MBHs are in place at the center of all ini-
tial galaxy models before the NSCs grow around them
These assumptions are not fully supported by our galaxy
formation model see Section 5 and articially lead to
an enhanced mass removal from the stellar clusters ac-
formation of galactic nuclei
Fig 7 The left panel displays the predicted fraction of all
galaxies fall containing a MBH MMBH  105M solid lines
and containing a MBH plus a NSC dashed lines The right panel
shows the fraction of nucleated galaxies fncl that contain a central
AGN identied here as a MBH with bolometric luminosity L 
1010 L
Thus the mass of the MBH grows faster then the mass
of the NSC with the transition from NSC dominated to
MBH-dominated galaxies occurring at MMBH  108M
or   150 kms This is roughly the value of  at which
NSCs appear to be signicantly aected by their host
galaxy MBHs in our models
The total mass ejected from the center depends also
on the number of stages in the merger hierarchy that
have occurred since the MBHs rst formed  ie after
Nm mergers the mass decit is  07NmMMBH with
MMBH the nal current black hole mass Merritt 2006
Some low-mass galaxies today might have never experi-
enced a major merger By contrast more massive galax-
ies form via mergers of primordial lower mass halos and
underwent an above average number of mergers In ad-
dition since the occupation fraction of MBHs increases
with galaxy mass the scouring eect of MBH binaries is
enhanced in the higher mass spheroids
From Figure 3 we also see that the GxeV model gener-
ates two distinct populations of NSCs at   100 kms
which can be easily identied by looking at the model
condence bands Nuclei with MNSC  107M have
masses that do not strongly correlate with their host
galaxy mass and velocity dispersion  the mass of these
NSCs lies signicantly below the mass that we would ob-
tain by extrapolating the scaling correlations from low
to high galaxy masses This population of underweight
nuclei is a result of the disruptive MBH binary merg-
ers that have partially eroded the surrounding clusters
NSCs above the model median seem instead to follow the
general trend outlined in the low mass galaxy region of
the plot where MNSC  2 The host galaxies of such
nuclei did not experience a major merger event since the
epoch of the last major gas accretion event so that their
NSCs remained essentially unaected by MBH binaries
up to the present epoch This picture is in agreement
with expectations based on hierarchical models of galaxy
formation  for example Fakhouri et al 2010 nd that
for a dark halo mass of 1012 M only 31 53 and 69 per
cent of these halos have experienced a major merger since
z 1 2 and 3 respectively
We can now ask which of the two processes tidal dis-
ruption of star clusters or mass ejection from MBH bi-
naries is responsible for the broadening of the scaling
correlations found in the data
Fig 6 The local
fraction of nucleated galaxies of our
models compared to observational constraints on the nucleated
fraction of early type galaxies in Virgo Cote et al 2006 For-
nax Turner et al 2012 and Coma den Brok et al 2014 The
lower panels are for late type galaxies The left panels show the
results of our ducial models with all the relevant eects included
the right panels correspond to models with no dynamical heating
due to MBHs see text for details A comparison between these
latter models and our ducial models indicate that the lack of NSCs
in galaxies more massive than  1011 M is due to MBHs that
fully destroy the surrounding clusters during galaxy mergers and
also quench their growth by disrupting migrating clusters due to
their strong central tidal eld
accretion of stellar clusters Thus as the MBH grows
the contribution of star cluster inspirals to NSC growth
decreases and eventually stops for MMBH  108M Us-

MMBH  86  106cid18
100kmscid19441
a MBH mass larger than  108M corresponds to stellar
spheroids with velocity dispersion   150 kms This
is consistent with the value of  at which the NSC-host
galaxy scaling correlations appear to atten in the data
sample
Another argument leads us to identify MMBH 
108M as the critical value of MBH mass above which
NSCs are signicantly aected The impact of a MBH
binary on a central cluster depends on the MNSCMMBH
mass ratio Given that during a merger a MBH binary
will eject a mass comparable to its total mass a require-
ment for a MBH binary to aect signicantly the nuclear
structure of a galaxy is that its mass is of the order of
or larger than the mass of the surrounding cluster ie

We nd that both CliN models with Mej  0 and
ones without the tidal truncationdisruption of clusters
by the central MBH produce scaling correlations that
appear to atten at   100 kms The NSC scaling
correlations produced by GxeV models in which we set
Mej  0 but in which we included the tidal disruption
of migrating clusters are instead at odds with obser-
vations as they show no broadening of the NSC host
galaxy property correlations for high velocity dispersion
galaxies only GxeV models that do take into account
the scouring eect of MBH binaries were found to be in
good agreement with the observed relations We con-
clude that in GxeV the crucial ingredient to reproduce
the MNSC-host galaxy property scaling relations is the
scouring eect of MBH binaries while the tidal strip-
ping of migrating clusters by central MBHs is only a
secondary eect in these models We remark that the
GxeV model has a clear advantage over the CliN model
because the former follows the hierarchical evolution of
NSCs and MBHs along merger-trees while the latter as-
sumes a monolithic evolution Although the results of the
two models are generally in good agreement with one an-
other the dierences outlined above are mainly a result
of the implicit assumption made in the CliN model that
the NSCs always grow around pre-existing MBHs This
leads to an articially enhanced mass removal from the
stellar clusters accreting onto the central NSC because
of the MBH tidal eld
To illustrate more clearly the role of MBH binaries in
shaping their companion NSC properties we compare in
Figure 5 the observationally constrained NSC to MBH
mass ratio in galaxies containing both types of central ob-
jects to the same ratio obtained i in our ducial GxeV
model containing all the relevant eects described in Sec-
tion 22 and ii a model in which we set Mej  0 ie
in which the scouring eect of MBH binaries was not
included in the calculation Clearly the scouring eect
due to MBH binaries described by equations 34 and
36 is the crucial ingredient to reproduce the observed
correlation Also note that the correlations produced
by the two models start to diverge from each other at
MMBH  108M in agreement with our predictions see
also Antonini et al 2015
411 NSC and MBH occupation fraction
Observationally the frequency of nucleation in early
type galaxies is found to increase sharply from zero for
spheroids brighter than MB  195 to  90 for
galaxies fainter than this magnitude Cote et al 2006
Turner et al 2012 In a sample of 332 late type galax-
ies Georgiev  Boker 2014 found that  80 of these
galaxies harbor a well dened NSC Hence NSCs are
found in most galaxies of all Hubble type but tend to
disappear in the brightest spheroids
Figure 6 compares the frequency of nucleation obtained
in our models to that of late and early-type galaxies
as derived from observations We dene here early-
type galaxies as systems with bulge-to-total mass ratio
MbulgeMgx  07 and late-type galaxies as systems with
MbulgeMgx  07 In agreement with observations our
models predict that almost all early-type galaxies that
are less massive than  1011 M contain a NSC and
that the frequency of nucleation is nearly zero for galax-
ies with mass larger than this value We note that the
exact occupation number obtained through GxeV should
be considered somewhat approximate  the identication
of a galaxy as nucleated in this model is uncertain given
that we cannot directly reconstruct the density prole
of the NSC and compare it to the density prole of the
galaxy background Nevertheless the occupation frac-
tion is found to decrease signicantly for early type galax-
ies with mass larger than 1011 M in good agreement
with observational constraints The bottom panel of Fig-
ure 6 shows the frequency of nucleation in late type sys-
tems Approximately  90 of these galaxies were found
to contain a NSC also in fairly good agreement with ob-
servations
The observed drop in the nucleation frequency at
high galaxy masses is often attributed to the disrup-
tive eects of MBH binaries forming during galaxy merg-
ers Bekki  Graham 2010 and to the tidal disruption
of migrating clusters at large galactocentric distances by
central MBHs Antonini 2013 In the right panels of Fig-
ure 6 we show the nucleated fraction in models where the
dynamical heating due to MBHs on migrating clusters
and during mergers was not included In these models
the percentage of nucleation remains close to 100 re-
gardless of galaxy luminosity demonstrating that MBHs
are responsible for the absence of NSCs in the most lu-
minous galaxies as also argued in previous work
NSCs and MBHs are known to coexist in some
galaxies across a wide range of masses and Hubble
types Seth et al 2008a However not all NSCs contain
a MBH an example is the M33 NSC that has no central
MBH down to highly constraining limits Merritt et al
2001 Gebhardt et al 2001 Studies indicate that at
least some NSCs can host a central MBH but the overall
occupation fraction of MBHs in NSCs remains unknown
The left panel of Figure 7 displays the fraction of all
galaxies in the GxeV model that contain a MBH and the
fraction of galaxies containing both a MBH and a NSC
Our models predict that a high fraction of galaxies of
intermediate and low luminosity contain a central NSC
but that the NSCs tend to disappear in massive galax-
ies Thus the total fraction of mixed systems with both a
NSC and a MBH is roughly equal to the MBH occupation
fraction for galaxies with mass Mgx  1011 M and is
roughly equal to the NSC occupation fraction for galax-
ies more massive than 1011 M
In the right panel of
Figure 7 we show the fraction of nucleated galaxies that
contain a MBH with bolometric luminosity L  1010L
We nd that the fraction of galaxies with a NSC that also
have an active MBH increases from  5 to 30 going
from Mgx  109 M to  1012 M These results are
in fairly good agreement with the observational results
from Seth et al 2008a who found that about 10 of
NSCs in their spectroscopic sample also host an AGN
42 In situ vs migration the relative contribution to
NSC growth
The lower panels of Figure 3 show the scaling rela-
tions generated by a version of the GxeV model with
no contribution from cluster inspirals In these models
the only mechanism responsible for the formation and
growth of the nuclei is local fragmentation of gas that
leads to star formation and in-situ build up of a central
compact cluster
The lower panels of Figure 3 demonstrate that even a
formation of galactic nuclei

The median of the mass distribution as a function of

in this model we obtain scaling relations that are consis-
tent with the observation that NSCs follow scaling rela-
tions that are shallower than the corresponding ones for

relations generated by our dissipative GxeV model for
MMBH  MNSC in slope and also within a factor of a
few in normalization
The mass growth of NSCs is regulated by two pro-
cesses
inspiral of star clusters and in-situ star forma-
tion In order to quantify the amount of NSC mass that
is contributed by local star formation in our models we
computed the ratio of the median NSC mass obtained by
including both cluster inspirals and in-situ star formation
to that obtained with only the contribution of in-situ star
formation We plot this quantity as a function of total
galaxy mass in Figure 8
In our models about half of the mass of NSCs is con-
tributed by local star formation for galaxies less massive
than  31011M while for galaxies more massive than
this value the contribution from dissipative processes be-
comes progressively more important Some provisional
evidence for a preferential dissipative mode in galaxies of
progressively larger masses was presented by Cote et al
2006 and Turner et al 2012 These authors showed
that the brightest nuclei which reside in the most lumi-
nous hosts have colors that are signicantly redder than
expected on the basis of a star cluster merger scenario
suggesting that an additional process  eg dissipational
infall of metal-rich gas during mergers  likely begins to
dominate the formation of nuclei in galaxies of higher
masses
We nally note that the relative contribution of the
two formation channels depends on the adopted value of
star cluster formation eciency fgc which remains a quite
uncertain parameter of our models However given that
plausible values of fgc were found to only impact the
normalization of our results for the empirical relations
and to not aect their slope assuming fgc  const we
can simply express the relative contribution of the two
formation channels using the general formulation

5 COSMOLOGICAL EVOLUTION OF SCALING
CORRELATIONS
The existence of a fundamental connection between
MBHs and NSCs was rst suggested by Ferrarese et al
2006a These authors showed that NSCs and MBHs
follow similar scaling relations with their host galaxy
properties and thus argued that they are two dier-
ent manifestations of the same astrophysical type of sys-
tem which they called central massive object Later
Graham 2012 used a large sample of nucleated galaxies

Eventually all the gas of the reservoir will either form

most of the nuclear gas will end up in the NSC rather

to show that the scaling relations of NSCs and MBHs are
quite dierent from each other with the former follow-
ing much shallower correlations with their host galaxy
properties Grahams ndings might suggest that NSCs
and MBHs formed through dierent physical processes
This could be the case if for example NSCs originated
elsewhere in the galaxy and then migrated to the cen-
ter through dynamical friction processes eg Antonini
Neumayer  Walcher 2012 presented a rst MMBH
versus MNSC diagram and found in agreement with our
study the existence of three dierent regimes a NSC
dominated nuclei at   100 kms b a transition re-
gion and c MBH-dominated nuclei at   150 kms
Neumayer  Walcher 2012 argued that this is consis-
tent with a picture in which black holes form inside NSCs
with a low-mass fraction They subsequently grow much
faster than the NSC destroying it completely when the
ratio MMBHMN SC grows above  100
Neumayer  Walcher 2012 also argued against MBH
mergers as responsible for the disruption of the nuclei
in the highest mass galaxies These authors pointed
out that if NSCs are disrupted during mergers elliptical
galaxies  thought to be the product of galaxy mergers
 should rarely host a NSC The fact that most early-
type galaxies have a NSC would therefore suggest that
mergers do not play a pivotal role in leading to NSC
disruption We do not agree with this interpretation
As discussed in Section 41 a MBH binary will
eject from the galaxy center a mass comparable to its
own mass so that only mergers with MBH to NSC
mass ratio larger than unity can signicantly heat the
NSC and make it susceptible to destruction during the
merger event NSCs can therefore survive and indeed
grow during the morphological transformation from disk-
dominated to bulge-dominated galaxies if the progenitor
galaxy NSCs are signicantly more massive than their
central MBHs Indeed from the NSC and MBH scaling
correlations we nd that NSCs dominate the nuclei of
galaxies with velocity dispersion   150kms so that
mergers of galaxies at the low end of the  distribution
will not lead to the complete disruption of the host galaxy
NSCs while mergers of massive galaxies characterized
by a larger MBH to NSC mass ratio will lead to their
full disruption This picture is consistent with both the
abundance of NSCs in early type galaxies of intermediate
luminosity and with the fact that NSCs tend to disap-
pear in the brightest spheroids hosting the most massive
To illustrate the simultaneous evolution of MBHs and
NSCs in our semi-analytical galaxy formation models
we plot in Figure 9 the MBH and NSC scaling correla-
tions at dierent redshifts and the corresponding mass
distributions in Figure 10 Specically in order to calcu-
late the median and condence regions in our model we
have have only considered the MBHs residing in bulge-
dominated galaxies which we identify with ones having
bulge to total mass ratio larger than 076
We nd that at high redshifts z  3 the nuclei of
galaxies are dominated by NSCs Between redshift 4
6 We make this choice to correct for the observational bias that
selects galaxies with a signicant bulge component so that mea-
surements of  are possible in the rst place
Fig 11 Same as Figure 9 but for the heavy MBH seed scenario
of Koushiappas et al 2004
and 2 the MBHs grow faster than the NSCs becoming
by z  3 the dominant nuclear component in galaxies
with   100kms After this point the NSC scaling
correlations start to atten at high values of  as MBH
binaries forming during mergers are now ecient at erod-
ing the surrounding clusters In addition the NSCs can
no longer grow eciently in the most massive galaxies
since inspiraling stellar clusters are tidally disrupted at
larger galactocentric distances in galaxies with progres-
sively more massive MBHs
Figure 10 displays the redshift evolution of the mass
distribution of MBHs and NSCs In these plots we in-
clude all galaxies in our models regardless of their spe-
cic value of bulge to total mass ratio At high red-
shift the NSCs are typically more massive than MBHs
after z  2 the mass distribution of NSCs intersects
at about 108 M the distribution of MBHs This sets
the transition between NSC dominated and MBH dom-
inated galaxies seen also in the observational data We
also compared our synthetic NSC mass distributions for
early type galaxies with the observed mass distribution of
NSCs for the catalogs of early type galaxies of Cote et al
2006 and Turner et al 2012 Anderson-Darling and

51 Dependence on the MBH seed model
In the previous sections we have discussed the results
of a galaxy formation model in which MBHs are evolved
starting at z  1520 from initial light masses Mseed 
200 M This could be the case if MBHs formed as
remnants of Pop III stars Madau  Rees 2001
In order to test the dependence of our results on the
assumed scenario for the formation of MBHs we evolved
additional models in which halos are initially populated
by MBH seeds of mass Mseed  105 M which could for
example form as a result of the collapse of massive proto-
galactic disks at redshifts z  1015 Koushiappas et al
2004 Begelman et al 2006 Lodato  Natarajan 2006
Volonteri et al 2008 In particular we consider a model
in which these heavy seeds form with high halo oc-
cupation number Koushiappas et al 2004 and one in
which the halo occupation number is moderate namely
the model of Volonteri et al 2008 where we set the
critical Toomre parameter below which the formation of
a MBH seed becomes possible to Qc  2
Figure 11 shows the redshift evolution of the MNSC 
and MMBH   relations in the case of the MBH heavy
seed scenario of Koushiappas et al 2004 Figure 12
displays the corresponding MBH and NSC mass distri-
butions from z  4 to z  0 A comparison of these
plots with those in Figures 9 and 10 demonstrates that
the local mass distribution of NSCs and their evolution
from high redshift is not aected by the MBH seed model
in any important way Of course the MBH mass func-
tion in the heavy-seed models diers from that in the
light-seed model at the low-mass end which is domi-
nated by MBHs that have not evolved signicantly from
their seeds However at intermediate and high masses
the MBH mass functions are very weakly dependent on
the seed model since memory of the initial conditions
has been lost due to accretion and mergers Note that
also in the heavy-seed scenarios we nd that the NSC
cumulative mass distributions at z  0 for early type
galaxies are consistent with the observed mass distribu-
tion in Cote et al 2006 and Turner et al 2012 at a
high level of signicance similar conclusions hold for the
seed model of Volonteri et al 2008
The fact that our results about NSC evolution are not
sensitive to the particular model chosen for the forma-
tion of MBH seeds is primarily a consequence of the high
NSC to MBH mass ratio at high redshift At z  3
in both the heavy and light seed scenarios the NSCs are
the dominant central component of galaxies with the ex-
ception of small NSC masses  106M at which MBHs
may dominate if they are seeded with high halo occupa-
tion number at high redshift It is only after the peak of
the quasar activity at z  2 that MBHs become massive
enough to signicantly aect the NSCs at intermediate
and high masses However by this time the MBH mass
distributions in dierent seed scenarios are very similar
to each other again with the exception of the low-mass
end and therefore the subsequent evolution of the NSCs
is also very similar The mass growth of the MBH popu-
lation is in fact dominated by the mass accreted during
the quasar epoch at z  2 thus washing out the imprint
of the initial conditions cf also Barausse 2012
Since to date the formation process of MBHs remains
largely unconstrained the fact that our results are ro-
bust against dierent initial seed formation scenarios is
important if we want to make robust predictions about
the overall evolution of the NSC population
6 DISCUSSION
61 Formation of the central regions of galaxies
In this paper we have presented a study aimed at un-
derstanding how the central regions of galaxies formed
and how the evolution of MBHs and NSCs is connected
to that of their host galaxy
In Figure 13 we show examples of NSC and MBH evo-
lution predicted by the GxeV model These cases should
be seen as qualitative because of the great variety of pos-
sible NSC and MBH histories that are possible within our
model but we have chosen examples that are roughly
representative of the various possibilities mentioned be-
low In more detail we consider the evolution of NSCs
back in time following their main progenitor ie we start
from the NSC hosted in the central galaxy at z  0 and
at each galaxy merger we follow its more massive NSC
progenitor When no NSC is present at z  0 in the cen-
tral galaxy namely in the bottom-left panel we follow
the main-progenitor history of the MBH As can be seen
NSCs grow by the combined action of i stellar-cluster
infall which happens continuously throughout their his-
tory but is particularly enhanced in starburst galaxies
cf the blue line in Figure 13 which denotes the mass
in stellar clusters and which shows a smooth evolution
with superimposed spikes due to starbursts and ii in-
situ star formation which takes places for the most part
in starburst galaxies formed by major mergers cf the
spikes in the mass of the low-angular momentum reser-
voir available for nuclear star formation ie the green
formation of galactic nuclei
Fig 13 Examples of possible main-progenitor evolutions of NSCs and MBHs as predicted by our model and for dierent nal products
at z  0 At upper left we indicate the nal product of the evolution a composite NSC MBH nucleus upper panels a NSC without
MBH middle panels or a MBH dominated nucleus lacking a NSC bottom panels We consider the evolution of the NSC hosted in the
central galaxy at z  0 and proceed back in time following the main NSC progenitor at each merger However when no NSC is present
in the central galaxy at z  0 namely in the bottom-left panel we follow the MBH main-progenitor history
line in Figure 13 Note also that MBH mergers have a
prominent eect on the MBH and NSC history not only
because MBH binaries erode or even completely destroy
the NSC if the MBHs are suciently massive but also
because the merger can eject the remnant MBH from the
galactic nucleus when the kick velocity imparted by the
anisotropic gravitational-wave emission is larger than the
escape velocity from the central parts of the galaxy Note
instead that the apparent re-growth of the MBH after
an ejection which can be seen in Figure 13 is simply
a consequence of our choice of following the NSC main-
progenitor history at certain galaxy mergers the galaxy
containing the main NSC but no MBH may merge with
one carrying a MBH
Below we discuss in more detail how the evolution of
the galaxy and its merger history can give rise to the
variety of galactic central structures observed today
Nucleated galaxies containing a MBH cf upper pan-
els of Figure 13
If the MBH mass does not grow above  107 M
throughout the evolution of the galaxy the central NSC
cannot be signicantly eroded during galaxy mergers by
inspiraling MBH binaries because of the large NSC to
MBH mass ratio Moreover stellar clusters will migrate
to the center essentially undisturbed by the tidal eld of
the central MBH
If during the last merger event the MBH remnant is
retained the end product will be a galaxy containing
both a central NSC and a MBH An example of such a
galaxy is the Milky Way which hosts a MBH of mass
 4  106M Ghez et al 1998 Gillessen et al 2009
and a NSC of mass  3  107 M Schodel et al 2014
Feldmeier et al 2014 A handful of external galaxies
are also know to contain both a NSC and a MBH which
are often found to have comparable masses Seth et al
2008b These galaxies lie near the transition region be-
tween MBH dominated and NSC dominated systems As
the MBHs of these galaxies grow MBH mergers will par-
tially destroy their host NSCs in the process eg upper
right panel of Figure 13
Nucleated galaxies without MBH cf middle panels of
Figure 13
After a merger a MBH can receive a kick due to gravi-
tational recoil with velocities as large as a few thousands
kms which may eject the MBH from its host galaxy
The ejected MBH will carry a cluster of bound stars
a hypercompact stellar system that can appear similar
in size and luminosity to star clusters or ultracompact
dwarf galaxies Merritt et al 2009 If the ejected MBH
has a mass  107M the NSC will remain virtually
unaected If from that point on the galaxy evolves pas-
sively without experiencing mergers which might bring a
new MBH to the center the evolutions end product will
be a nucleus containing a NSC but no MBH Examples of
such type of evolution are illustrated in the middle panels
of Figure 13 A similar end product can be attained if a
MBH seed never formed and the galaxy evolved without
experiencing major mergers during its entire evolution
Antonini Barausse and Silk
We note in passing that whether a MBH seed will form
might depends on the properties of the central cluster at
high redshift Miller  Davies 2012 If the accumulated
cluster has a high velocity dispersion   40 kms this
might seed the growth of a central MBH because kine-
matic heating from binary stars is insucient to prevent
complete core collapse which might then lead to run-
away mergers and the formation of a central MBH seed
of  103 M
In galaxies hosting clusters with initial
velocity dispersion less than 40 kms binaries will pre-
vent core collapse and consequently the formation of a
MBH seed Galaxies with clusters with initial velocity
dispersions below this limit might therefore never form a
MBH Such evolutionary path might lead to the forma-
tion of galactic nuclei such as those of M33 or NGC205
which lack a MBH and host a low velocity dispersion
NSC Merritt et al 2001 Gebhardt et al 2001
MBH dominated galaxies without NSC cf lower pan-
els of Figure 13
After the MBH mass grows above  108 M any ma-
jor merger will be highly disruptive for a central NSC
MBH binaries forming during major mergers in this high
MBH mass regime will carve out the galactic center of
stars destroying a pre-existing NSC eventually produc-
ing a central mass-decit Milosavljevic  Merritt 2001
Bekki  Graham 2010
The accretion of a nucleated dwarf galaxy by a low-
density giant galaxy could bring a NSC to the center
of the latter galaxy However Merritt  Cruz 2001
showed that the secondary galaxy is disrupted during the
merger by the giant galaxy MBH tidal eld producing
a remnant with a central density that is only slightly
higher than that of the giant galaxy initially Moreover
as shown in Antonini 2013 after a NSC is disrupted in
a dry merger it will have a hard time to regrow because
the MBH tidal eld is eective at disrupting migrating
clusters Thus once the galactic MBH mass grows above
 108 M the central NSC is likely to be disrupted
and the central core is likely to be preserved during the
subsequent evolution of the galaxy
Low mass spheroids without NSC
NSCs tend to disappear in Galaxies fainter than MV 
12 van den Bergh 1986 While the purely dissipa-
tionless formation model CliN predicts that the NSC
occupation fraction decreases substantially in low mass
systems in agreement with observations the GxeV model
results in a high occupation fraction of NSCs in low mass
galaxies and it is therefore in tension with observational
ndings We believe that the reason for this discrep-
ancy is that discreteness eects are not accounted for in
GxeV as argued in the following In this latter model
we compute the ux of mass accreting onto the nucleus
by averaging over the initial mass function of the stellar
cluster population In CliN  we simulate instead the in-
spiral of each of the formed clusters drawing their masses
from the same initial mass function Because of the ini-
tial small number of stellar clusters in low mass galaxies
and because of the steep power law that we adopt for
their initial mass function some of these galaxies will
host no cluster that is massive enough to decay to the
center before being disrupted in the process This sug-
gests that the lack of NSCs in spheroids less luminous
than MV  12 is a consequence of the initial low num-
ber of massive clusters in these galaxies Clearly this ef-
fect cannot be accounted for in the GxeV model which
does not follow the evolution of individual stellar clusters
but rather the average mass infall to the nucleus
62 Galaxy cores and cusp regeneration
Our analysis focuses on the mass evolution of NSCs
and ignores eects due to dynamical relaxation that can
change the density prole of the clusters over time We
have shown that the merger history of galaxies after z 
2 plays a key role in determining the structure of NSCs
observed today and their disappearance in the brightest
galaxies In our models we did not account for relaxation
processes that can rebuild an eroded cusp as stars diuse
into the MBH sphere of inuence Even if a NSC is
fully disrupted during a merger a stellar cusp of mass of
order 10 the mass of the black hole and extending out
to one tenth its sphere of inuence will reform over the
relaxation time Merritt  Szell 2006 Although cusp
regrowth is not expected to have an important eect on
the mass evolution of the NSCs it is worth discussing it
as the ability of a MBH to shape a galactic nucleus and
the observational consequences depend on whether cores
are regenerated or preserved after mergers
Bekki  Graham 2010 performed N -body simula-
tions to investigate the evolution of merging star clus-
ters with seed black holes Using black holes masses of
1  5 their host NSC ones they investigated how the
binary coalescence dynamically heats and destroys the
surrounding clusters While Bekki  Graham 2010 ar-
gued that this mechanism provides a pathway to explain
the observed reduction in the nucleus-to-galaxy stellar
mass ratio as one proceeds from dwarf to giant elliptical
galaxies they did not discuss how their results would be
aected by two-body relaxation after the MBH binary
merges and between mergers
During galaxy mergers cores are carved out in the
stellar distribution with radii of order the inuence ra-
dius of the massive binary This makes NSC suscep-
tible to disruption On the other hand if the supply
of stars is continuously replenished the damage to the
NSC can be much smaller Furthermore even if a large
core is formed a stellar density cusp can regrow via en-
ergy exchanges between stars moving in the gravitational
eld of the MBH remnant Black holes with masses of
1  5 that of the NSC such as those considered in
Bekki  Graham 2010 correspond to low mass galax-
ies with a short  109 yr relaxation time From equa-
tion 40 one nds that such a low mass ratio corresponds
to a MBH mass of  5  105 M Using equation 39
this corresponds to a host stellar spheroid velocity dis-
persion of  50 kms
In such low mass galaxies the
cusp will regenerate itself in about 1 Gyr from the infall
of a second black hole as collisional relaxation drives the
stellar distribution toward its steady state form Merritt
2013 We conclude that in low mass spheroids the eect
of MBH binaries on the host NSC density distribution is
expected to be minimal and their imprint on the nuclear
properties is expected to be erased after a short time
The probability that a galaxy of the size of the Milky
Way experienced a major merger ie with mass ratio
larger than 03 after z  2 is about 50 Fakhouri et al
2010 Galaxies of such luminosities have relaxation
formation of galactic nuclei
times that are longer than the age of the galaxy but
which are short enough that two-body relaxation might
have aected their central clusters These galaxies might
have nuclei that are still evolving toward their steady
state after they were dynamically heated by a MBH bi-
nary Thus the results of our models imply that under-
massive NSCs in galaxies with bulge mass Mbulge 
1010 M might still carry an imprint of the merger his-
tory of their host galaxy in the form of a density core that
extends out to a small fraction of the central MBH inu-
ence radius Whether these NSCs will turn out to harbor
parsec-scale cores will be addressed in the future with
high resolution imaging which will enable to resolve the
crowded stellar environment of NSCs Gullieuszik et al
7 CONCLUSIONS
NSCs and MBHs represent important central compo-
nents of galaxies that bear witness to their formation
history Our aim has been to generate a numerical frame-
work to better understand how the central structures of
galaxies formed and how the evolution of MBHs and
NSCs is connected to that of their host galaxies
We have studied the evolution of NSCs in a cosmolog-
ical context by taking into account the growth of MBHs
by merging subhalos containing both MBHs and NSCs
A semi-analytical galaxy formation model is applied to
follow the evolution of dark matter halos along merger
trees as well as that of the baryonic components Speci-
cally the evolution of dark matter halos along the merger
trees includes their baryonic components such as hot gas
stellar and gaseous bulges and stellar and gaseous galac-
tic disks We study the simultaneous evolution of MBHs
and NSCs in our galaxy formation model The main re-
sults of our work are summarized in the following
1 The mass growth of NSCs is seen to be regulated
by inspiral of star clusters in-situ star formation as well
as galaxy and MBH mergers We have found that both
cluster inspirals and in-situ star formation contribute a
signicant fraction of the total mass of NSCs
2 We found that in-situ star formation as well as
growth through migrating clusters generates NSC - host
galaxy scaling relations that are much shallower than the
same correlations for MBHs in agreement with observa-
3 In our model the merger history of galaxies after
z  2 plays a key role in determining the structure of
the NSCs observed today Core-depletion due to grav-
itational slingshot of host galaxy stars by inspiralling
MBHs forming during galaxy mergers has a negligible
impact on the evolution of NSCs in low mass galaxies
while it leads to their full disruption in galaxies more
massive than  1011 M
In galaxies of intermediate
luminosity  1010 M MBH mergers cause the partial
dissolution of the clusters Such partially eroded clus-
ters appear at z  0 signicantly underweight relative to
linear NSC-host spheroid scaling correlations The pres-
ence of an under-massive NSC population results in an
increased scatter of the NSC-host galaxy empirical cor-
relations at high galaxy luminosities for which we nd
evidence in observational data
4 We identify MMBH  108M as the critical value of
MBH mass above which NSCs are signicantly aected
Once the galactic MBH mass grows above this value
MBH binary mergers become highly disruptive for the
central NSC leading to the formation of a central low
density core For galaxies more massive than the Milky
Way after such low density core forms the central galac-
tic regions are likely to remain depleted of stars through-
out the subsequent evolution of the galaxy
5 Our models predict that the fraction of nucleated
early type galaxies containing an accreting MBH with
bolometric luminosity L  1010 L increases from 5
at Mgx  109 M to 30 at Mgx  1011 M These frac-
tions are found to be much smaller for late type galax-
ies for which only  10  of nucleated galaxies with
Mgx  1011 M also contain an active MBH Among
galaxies of all types the fraction of mixed systems con-
taining both a MBH and a NSC is about  20 at
109 M  Mgx  1011 M
6 We found that the results shown in this paper are
quite robust when we change the cluster formation e-
ciency fgc  02 when we allow fgc to vary with galactic
properties eg we set it to 007 004 and 05 in disk
quiescent and starburst galaxies respectively Kruijssen
2012 when we change the MBH seed model ie light-
seed models vs heavy-seed models with several halo oc-
cupation numbers at high redshift as well as other de-
tails of our model such as merger-tree resolution initial
redshift of the simulations prescriptions for AGN feed-
back etc
In conclusion our study supports a scenario in which
black holes form inside NSCs with a low-mass fraction so
that NSCs are initially the dominant central component
of galaxies After their formation NSCs and MBHs grow
in parallel on their own scaling correlations with host
galaxy properties with NSCs dominating in low mass
spheroids and MBHs dominating in high mass galaxies
The simple fact that NSCs and MBHs grow on dierent
scaling correlations explains the well known transition
from MBH- to NSC-dominated galaxies as one proceeds
from dwarfs to giant ellipticals without the need of in-
voking competitive feedback processes from young NSCs
andor AGN activity
