ABSTRACT
Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 NLS1 galaxies show extreme properties with respect to the
other Seyfert galaxies Indeed they are thought to be accreting at Eddington rates
and to possess low mass black holes Therefore they may represent a key class of
objects for understanding the co-evolution of black holes and their host galaxies We
propose that NLS1s represent a class of AGN in which the black hole growth is and
has always been dominated by secular evolution Firstly by looking at the NLS1 host
galaxy properties in the literature we show that the evolution of NLS1s is presently
driven by secular processes much more so than for Broad-Line Seyfert 1s BLS1s
Secondly we study the bulges of NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies Our results demonstrate
that NLS1 host bulges are pseudo-bulges and are statistically dierent from BLS1
bulges This dierence points to the particular importance of secular processes in the
past evolution of their hosts We build on this result to understand the implications
on their evolution and the duration of their duty cycle We show that NLS1s are not
necessarily in a special phase of black hole growth and that several Gyr are required
for their black hole masses to become similar to BLS1s Finally in the light of our
results we discuss the location of NLS1 galaxies on the MBH- plane and speculate
about the connection between the NLS1 galaxy properties and their black hole spin
Key words Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy - galaxies bulges active evolution
INTRODUCTION
Since their discovery Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 NLS1 galax-
ies have always been recognized as particular objects hold-
ing important clues on the driving mechanisms of nuclear
activity First identied as objects similar to Seyfert 1s with
narrower Balmer lines they were soon recognized as hav-
ing exceptional spectral properties both in their emission
lines and in their continuum see Komossa 2008 for a re-
view In fact as shown through principal components anal-
ysis eg Boroson 2002 NLS1 galaxies are mostly clustered
at one extreme end of the AGN parameter space strongest
FeIIOIII emission and lowest luminosity Likewise they
are thought to possess small mass black holes and to have
high Eddington accretion rates In this sense NLS1s could

represent key objects in understanding the AGN phenomena
and the co-evolution of massive black holes and their host
galaxies
While the main dening criteria of NLS1s with respect
to BLS1s is the empirical threshold at FWHMH  2000
km s1 the properties of NLS1s have been extensively stud-
ied across many wavelength ranges Trends and correla-
tions have been identied using rst small samples and later
corroborated by larger surveys eg Veron-Cetty  Veron
2001 Williams et al 2002 Zhou et al 2006 Many scenar-
ios have been considered to explain these properties in par-
ticular their high accretion rates LLEdd  1 eg Boroson
2002 Grupe 2004 and reference therein and low black hole
masses typically of order 106M eg Boller et al 1996
Zhou et al 2006 Ryan et al 2007 but also eg outows
winds and density eects high metallicity particular broad
line region thicknesses and densities etc see Komossa 2008
2 G Orban de Xivry et al
and references therein While these scenarios can elucidate
the nuclear properties of NLS1s they hardly explain the
origin of the fundamental dierences between NLS1s and
BLS1s and in particular that NLS1s appear to be more
than just Seyfert 1s with narrow lines A few key questions
could be formulated as follows which particular mechanisms
would lead to the Eddington accretion rates commonly seen
in NLS1s but observed less often in BLS1s What causes the
dierence in black hole growth of NLS1s and BLS1s that re-
sults in low mass black holes in the former case Could dif-
fering host galaxy evolution explain the dierences between
NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies
In this paper rather than studying the active nuclei
we investigate the host galaxies of NLS1s and contrast their
properties to those of BLS1s pursuing the hypothesis that
dierent host galaxy evolution could explain the dierences
between NLS1s and BLS1s In particular we explore the
relative role of secular processes in the evolution of NLS1
and BLS1 galaxies Reviewing the literature on the mor-
phology and the star formation in NLS1 and BLS1 hosts
we emphasize in section 2 the present-day dierences in
their respective host galaxies Afterwards in section 3 we
turn to the past evolution of NLS1 and BLS1 hosts We
perform a bulge-disk decomposition of samples of NLS1 and
BLS1 galaxies and look at their bulge properties Using pre-
viously established criteria Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
Fisher  Drory 2008 Gadotti 2009 we are able to distin-
guish pseudo- from classical bulges This enables us to de-
termine the main processes that have driven the evolution
of the NLS1 and BLS1 hosts We analyse the dierences of
NLS1 and BLS1 host bulge property distributions conclud-
ing that NLS1 galaxies contain pseudo-bulges and hence
have always been dominated by secular evolution Finally
in section 4 and section 5 we investigate the cosmological
context of the NLS1 host phenomenon driven by such an
evolutionary mode We then note the link between secular
evolution and rapidly spinning black holes and speculate on
the location of NLS1 galaxies on the MBH   relation We
conclude by summarizing our picture of the NLS1 galaxy
phenomenon and present ways to further test our proposi-

2 SECULAR EVOLUTION IN NLS1 HOST
GALAXIES
In this section we review the literature that has been pub-
lished concerning the dierences in the host galaxy prop-
erties of NLS1s and BLS1s We focus in particular on the
morphology and the star formation rate and emphasize the
role of present secular processes in distinguishing between
these two classes of type 1 AGN
21 Morphological properties
211 Large-scale bars
The morphology of NLS1 host galaxies has been studied
in several papers Crenshaw et al 2003 Deo et al 2006
Ohta et al 2007 Ryan et al 2007 The main results can
be summarized as follows
NLS1 host galaxies are likely to be strongly barred much
more than BLS1 ones and their nuclear dust morphology is
likely to be a grand-design spiral
The bar frequency among NLS1 and BLS1 host galaxies
has been studied by Crenshaw et al 2003 and Ohta et al
2007 The rst paper reports a visual study based on an
HST survey of 91 Seyfert galaxies 13 NLS1s and 78 BLS1s
at z 6 0035 Malkan et al 1998 and 6 additional NLS1s
at z 6 0084 HST archives in the Veron-Cetty et al 2001a
sample The results are striking 91 of the sample is classi-
ed as spiral galaxies among which 65 of NLS1s have bars
and 25 of BLS1s have bars More particularly the authors
look at the fraction of barred spiral galaxies in their sample
as a function of the full width at half maximum FWHM
of the broad component of the H emission line As pre-
sented in Fig 1 they obtain a clear dierence between the
two regimes of NLS1s and BLS1s We note that in this g-
ure since FWHM measurements are not available for every
BLS1 we have made a single bin for the BLS1 class
The results from Ohta et al 2007 are more conserva-
tive They use an heterogeneous set of data of NLS1 galaxies
and look at the morphology and the possible trends with the
NLS1 properties They perform a visual and a quantitative
classication based on ellipse tting of isophotes While they
conrm the high bar fraction among spiral NLS1 hosts
they do not observe a clear trend with the FWHM Never-
theless if we consider only the fraction of spirals with strong
bars SB but not SAB the trend does appear clearly using
their visual classication as represented in Fig 1 Turning
to their quantitative classication we note that one of the
criteria Ohta et al use to identify the bars is an ellipticity
bar  025 where bar  maxgalaxy However a common
practice to identify strong bars is to use bar  045 eg
Shlosman et al 2000 Applying this latter criterion on their
sample by examining the ellipse t plots we obtain for the
respective bins in Fig 1 ie 5001000 10001500 1500
2000 km s1 bar fractions ie 89 46 and 57 similar
to their visual classication ie 100 50 and 57 see
Fig 1
212 Circumnuclear morphology
In a study of nuclear dust morphology in a matched-paired
sample of activeinactive galaxies and barredunbarred
galaxies Martini et al 2003 show that grand-design nu-
clear dust spirals are only found in galaxies with a large-scale
bar However while not nding any universal nuclear mor-
phology in active galaxies they do nd similar features in
the circumnuclear environments of both active and inactive
galaxies In another study Deo et al 2006 investigate the
nuclear dust morphology in NLS1 and BLS1 host galaxies
based only on the HST survey conducted by Malkan et al
1998 Their study also shows that the grand-design nu-
clear dust spirals are largely present in barred galaxies They

Eddington ratio and stronger star formation activity com-
pared to their broad-line counterparts
Crenshaw et al 2003
23 Secular processes all the way to the SMBH
As discussed above the current morphology of NLS1 host
galaxies is distinguishable from other Seyfert galaxies In-
deed in contrast to BLS1s NLS1 galaxies are likely to be
strongly barred and to show more intense central star for-
mation This is in line with the fact that bars are known to
drive gas into the central kiloparsecs Sakamoto et al 1999
Sheth et al 2005 and that nuclear star formation is en-
hanced in barred galaxies Ho et al 1997
While no universal
fueling mechanism for
luminosity AGNs seems to operate in galactic nuclei
Martini et al 2003 the NLS1 host morphology typically
exhibits a circumnuclear grand-design spiral This appears
to be linked to the presence of strong bars Martini et al
2003 Deo et al 2006 and indeed bars are able to drive cir-
cumnuclear spiral structures Maciejewski 2004ab Hence
NLS1 galaxies show uninterrupted asymmetries able to drive
the gas inwards from a few kpc to a few tens of pc The par-
ticular strength of secular processes in NLS1s could therefore
account for the high central star formation and presumably
to the large Eddington rates observed in NLS1s
Figure 1 Histograms presenting the fraction of Seyfert 1 spirals
a with bars and b with nuclear grand-design spirals as a func-
tion of the FWHM of their broad emission line H Drawn from
data reported in Crenshaw et al 2003 Ohta et al 2007 and
Deo et al 2006
classify the nuclear structures and nd that 1 the nu-
clear dust morphologies in NLS1BLS1 BarredUnbarred
are mainly nuclear dust spirals 2 in the nuclear dust
spiral class NLS1s are more likely to have grand-design
spirals than BLS1s Fig 1 also shows that this fraction of
grand-design spirals in NLS1s follows the same trend with
the FWHMH as the bar fraction
As we expect strong bars to drive a circumnuclear spi-
ral structure Maciejewski 2004ab and to drive gas in-
wards Sakamoto et al 1999 Sheth et al 2005 we expect
the presence of such asymmetries in host galaxies to result
in an enhanced star formation in the central kiloparsecs
22 Star formation
In a recent paper Sani et al 2010 study the link between
star formation in the central kpc vs FWHMH in NLS1
and BLS1 host galaxies After discussing carefully possible
luminosity and distance eects they conclude that NLS1s
are associated with more intense star formation than BLS1s
with on average a star formation to AGN ratio  2 times
larger in NLS1s More generally they nd that type 1 AGNs
with narrower broad emission lines reside in hosts containing
more intense star-forming regions
Finally they nd a connection between high Eddington
ratio and high star formation rates concluding that NLS1s
are characterized by smaller black hole BH mass larger
3 BULGES OF NLS1 HOST GALAXIES
Since strong secular evolution is currently occurring in
NLS1s it is important to ask whether or not secular pro-
cesses have shaped the NLS1 host galaxies by dominating
their past evolution and hence inuencing their black hole
growth
We address this issue by examining the bulges of NLS1
host galaxies and comparing them to those of BLS1s since
one can expect to observe evolutionary dependent bulge
characteristics Specically an evolution driven mainly by
galaxy mergers will result in dierent bulge properties than
if the evolution is mainly driven by internal secular evolu-
In this section we compare NLS1 and BLS1 galax-
ies by performing a photometric bulge-disk decomposition
of homogeneous samples of NLS1s and BLS1s This com-
parison is put in perspective with previous studies on the
distinction between pseudo- and classical bulges in inac-
tive galaxies Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 Fisher  Drory
2008 Gadotti 2009 and also on the bulge-disk decomposi-
tion of two galaxy samples composed exclusively of NLS1s
Ryan et al 2007 Mathur et al 2011
31 Pseudo-bulges and secular evolution in disk
galaxies
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 review in detail the forma-
tion of pseudo-bulges by secular processes As dense central
components of galaxies pseudo-bulges dier from classical
bulges in that they were made slowly by disks out of disk
material while classical bulges are merger-built bulges
Therefore pseudo-bulges are formed by internal secular pro-
cesses such as bar instabilities spiral structures etc as op-
4 G Orban de Xivry et al
posed to galaxy mergers or external secular evolution minor
mergers prolonged gas infall etc
As pseudo-bulges retain memory of their disky origin
it is possible to disentangle them from classical bulges
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 pointed out the Sersic in-
dex as one way to identify them Indeed since a pseudo-
bulge forms from gas accreting from the disk it has a sur-
face brightness prole similar to that of the outer disk and
therefore would have a low Sersic index nb  1  2
Fisher  Drory 2008 have studied in great detail the
structure of classical bulges and pseudo-bulges using high-
resolution data 77 inactive galaxies with data in the HST
archive and z 001 They use morphological signatures to
rst visually classify the bulges of nearby galaxies as pseudo
or classical They then perform a bulge-disk decomposition
and study in particular the distribution of Sersic indices
They nd that statistically pseudo-bulges have Sersic in-
dices nb  2 while classical bulges have nb  2 This result
shows that the Sersic index is a good statistical tool to test
if a class of objects has classical or pseudo-bulges
Finally Gadotti 2009 also study pseudo- and classical
bulges using a large low resolution SDSS sample of galax-
ies 1000 inactive galaxies with 002 6 z 6 007 He uses
the position in the  e  re plane also called the Ko-
rmendy relation1 to study the bulge properties and iden-
ties pseudo-bulges as being fainter in surface brightness
for a given half-light radius much fainter than predicted
by the correlation t to elliptical galaxies Where Gadotti
2009 clearly sees independent groups in his i-band den-
sity plot of the Kormendy relation  e  re relation
Fisher  Drory 2008 2010 only nd that pseudo-bulges
scatter around the photometric projections of the funda-
mental plane
Nevertheless all these authors Fisher  Drory 2008
Gadotti 2009 Fisher  Drory 2010 agree that most of the
pseudo-bulges have a low Sersic index nb  2 and that they
tend to be less prominent than classical bulges in particular
they tend to have a low bulge-to-total light ratio
Based on these considerations for bulge classication in
inactive galaxies we will use the Sersic index to identify the
prevailing bulge type in the NLS1 and BLS1 populations as
pseudo- or classical We will then study the prominence of
NLS1 and BLS1 bulges
32 Bulgedisk decomposition
Building on the work of Fisher  Drory 2008 for inactive
galaxies we select archive HST images of Seyfert galaxies
to study the bulges of active galaxies in order to assess
whether the bulge characteristics of NLS1s and BLS1s might
explain by their evolutionary implications the distinctions
between these two classes of AGN Crucially by performing
the bulge-disk decomposition for samples of both NLS1s and
BLS1s we minimize the impact of any systematic errors that
our tting procedure might generate
select NLS1 and BLS1
from the
Malkan et al 1998 HST imaging survey of nearby AGNs
galaxies
This survey contains a uniform sample of 91 Seyfert 1 galax-
ies at z 6 0035 observed with the Wide Field Planetary
Camera 2 WFPC2 through the F606W lter This sample
also used by Crenshaw et al 2003 and Deo et al 2006 in
their morphological studies contains 11 NLS1 galaxies and
80 BLS1 galaxies The 11 NLS1 galaxies are genuine NLS1s
as identied by Veron-Cetty et al 2001b on the basis of
their optical spectra broad component of H  2000km
s1 and strong FeII emission and are listed in the cata-
log of Veron-Cetty  Veron 2010 We therefore initially
select all the 11 NLS1 galaxies available as well as 21 of
the 80 BLS1s The BLS1 sample selection is made in a
way to roughly match the 25 fraction of such hosts that
are strongly barred Crenshaw et al 2003 Their individ-
ual Seyfert classications are reported in Tab 1 These are
taken from Veron-Cetty  Veron 2010 with 2 exceptions
IC1816 is classied by Marquez et al 2004 as a type 1
Because their spectrum shows clear evidence of broad emis-
sion we have adopted this classication For NGC5252
we have followed the classication as a type 19 given in
Osterbrock  Martel 1993 because the presence of broad
H with a measured FWHM of 2500 km s1 is conrmed
by Acosta-Pulido et al 1996 We note that the broad H
is very clear in polarized light Tran 2010 and shows dra-
matic variations over a period of several years This may
be why there is some uncertainty about its classication as
a type 1 or 2 Following this initial selection we rene our
sample based on the limited eld of view FoV of WFPC2
by rejecting objects with z  0010 or scales 6023 kpc in
order to obtain a reasonable minimum FoV of 88kpc on
each object This criterion ensures that the disk of the host
can be tted properly while the redshift limit of the orig-
inal source catalogue ensures that the bulge is suciently
well resolved The two nal samples for which we performed
the bulge-disk decomposition are composed of 10 NLS1s and
19 BLS1s and are given in Tab 1 Finally we check that
the mean redshift is not strongly biased with respect to the
NLS1 sample  zNLS1  0024  zBLS1  0027 and
that no particular circumnuclear morphology has been se-
lected
To perform the bulge-disk decomposition of these 29
galaxies we use the two-dimensional prole tting algorithm
Galfit2 Peng et al 2010 For each galaxy we iteratively
t three components a Gaussian prole a Sersic prole and
an exponential prole see also Appendix A These com-
ponents are aimed at modelling respectively the nuclei the
bulges and the disks of our galaxies While these HST data of
nearby AGN have small pixel scales see column 4 in Tab 1
enabling us to better constrain the central regions of the
galaxies the FoV of WFPC2  35
35 is small relative
to the full extent of the galaxies This makes it hard to con-
strain the sky level This issue has already been addressed
to some extent by the renement of our sample selection to
objects with z  0010 We cover it further in Appendix B
when we discuss our treatment of the possible coupling be-
tween the background level and the exponential prole Fi-
nally we analyze the robustness of our t by studying the
eect of saturated regions in the images and the dependence
of the ts to the PSF We detail our iterative t procedure

the eective radius  e  and the half-light radius re which is

point-like and is better described by a single high Sersic in-
dex prole while ESO438G9 seems to be a bulgeless galaxy
also consistent with its morphological type We have there-
fore excluded these two objects from the bulge analysis dis-

contrast to  nb  349 obtained by Fisher  Drory for
classical bulges Thus our results suggest that BLS1s do
not have pure classical bulges but rather mixed bulges
composed of pseudo- and classical components
is appropriate to mention here the work of
Laurikainen et al 2007 They found that
for inactive
galaxies the mean bulge Sersic index is 25 or less across
the Hubble sequence These results can also be interpreted
as the existence of a large range of composite bulges between
the two extreme pseudo- and classical bulge types
Putting this result into perspective with our bulgedisk de-
composition suggests that the bulges of NLS1 hosts are likely
to be pure pseudo-bulges while the bulges of BLS1 hosts
appear to be composite bulges and hence have Sersic indices
distributed around nb  25
In order to test the signicance of the dierence be-
tween the Sersic index distributions of NLS1s and BLS1s
we use the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test As such the cumula-

tive distributions of the Sersic index are presented in Fig 3
The slopes of these distributions reect the dierence in the
dispersions given above n  039 and 097 for the NLS1
and BLS1 samples respectively They emphasize that the
population of NLS1 bulges appears to be like the popu-
lation of pseudo-bulges while the properties of the BLS1
bulges are more widely distributed between pseudo- and
classical bulges While we cannot fully reject the null hy-
pothesis of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test it yields a proba-
bility of  12 that the NLS1s and the BLS1s are drawn
from the same parent distribution This is a remarkable re-
sult that again underlines the connection between black hole
and bulge properties
Since a result from Weinzirl et al 2009 suggests a pos-
sible link between bars and bulges we verify that the rela-
tive bar fractions in our samples have a minimum impact on
our result of Fig 2 Indeed as described previously in sec-
tion 32 our selection of NLS1s and BLS1s respects the rel-
ative bar fraction observed ie  25 in BLS1 and  75
in NLS1 galaxies Therefore we consider in Fig 4 right
the distribution of bulge Sersic indices of NLS1 and BLS1
galaxies with bars only While we observe a general small
shift towards lower Sersic indices as expected from eg
Weinzirl et al 2009 NLS1 and BLS1 are clearly distinct
Following this observation we reasonably conclude that al-
though the presence of a bar can be linked to the bulge Sersic

index it does not imply that the bulge is a pseudo-bulge
Thus our result that NLS1s tend to possess pure pseudo-
bulges in contrast to BLS1s is not a consequence of dierent
bar fractions in the two populations
Finally we consider the inuence of the Seyfert type
of the BLS1s on our Sersic measurements Indeed changes
from type 1 to intermediate type Seyferts can be attributed
to changes in the ionizing radiation of the AGN eg
Goodrich 1990 or to variation in the absorbing material
Maiolino  Rieke 1995 Forster 1999 or as well to dierent
inclination of the host galaxies eg Maiolino  Rieke 1995
Ramos Almeida et al 2009 These eects can explain the
large Balmer decrements in the optical spectra of intermedi-
ate type galaxies but can also indirectely bias our Sersic in-
dex measurements Indeed in the case of intermediate type
Seyferts a fainter AGN would ease the t but an excess of
dust in the host galaxy and projection eects nearly edge-on
host spirals can make tting the host harder For these rea-
sons we check whether there is any systematic eect on our
ts by looking at the Sersic index versus the Seyfert type of
the BLS1s given in Tab 1 the result is given Fig 4 left
Since no trend of the Sersic index with the BLS1 sub-class
can be observed we can be condent that our ts are not bi-
ased by systematic eects related to the intermediate BLS1
classications
Similarly NLS1s are a sub-class of type 1 AGN for
which the Seyfert sub-classication is based solely on the
properties of the AGN itself But our result also shows that
the bulge properties of the NLS1 host galaxies do represent
a distinct sub-class of the bulges of BLS1 hosts
332 Bulge prominence and fundamental plane
projections
Building on our t results we study the bulge prominence
by looking at the size distribution of the bulges as well
as the bulge-to-disk BD and bulge-to-total BT light
ratios The rst objective here is to further explore the dif-
ferences between NLS1 and BLS1 host bulges But doing
so also enables us to conrm the validity of our bulge-disk
decomposition

We compute the BD and BT light ratios using our
t parameters see Equation A3 and Equation A4 given
in Tab 2 and present their distribution in Fig 5 left
The median BT of 039 in BLS1s and 017 in NLS1s indi-
cates that NLS1 galaxies have lower BT light ratios than
BLS1s We compare these distributions to BT 041
for an average classical bulge and BT 016 for an av-
erage pseudo-bulge given by Fisher  Drory 2008 Gadotti
2009 also nds similar values The BT ratio therefore pro-
vides strong support for our conclusion that NLS1 bulges are
pseudo-bulges while BLS1 bulges are largely composite or
classical
In the same Fig 5 right we also plot the BT
light ratios versus the Hubble Type the Sersic index and
the eective radius of the bulges As expected the mean
BT ratio tends to decrease with the Hubble Type eg
Graham  Worley 2008 Masters et al 2010 and hence it
appears that NLS1 galaxies tend to be of later type than
BLS1 galaxies Fig 5 left The two last plots illustrate
again that NLS1 bulges have less prominent ie smaller
fainter less cuspy bulges than BLS1 bulges
While the Sersic index is a convincing tool to distinguish
pseudo-bulges from classical bulges Fisher  Drory 2008
Gadotti 2009 uses the Kormendy relation  e  re
to identify pseudo-bulges as fainter bulges than predicted
by the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies In Fig 6
we present the Kormendy relation the surface brightness
magnitude at the eective radius and the Sersic index versus
the eective radius of the bulge For Fig 6 a and b we
have overdrawn linear ts to the data for the BLS1 sample
While these do not reveal any marked oset between the
two NLS1 and BLS1 classes NLS1 bulges are systematically
fainter than those of BLS1 ie they tend to lie under the
line This result is consistent with the common structural
properties we are nding for the NLS1 class Finally Fig 6
c shows NLS1 and BLS1 host bulges together with pseudo-
and classical bulges from Fisher  Drory 2008 in the nb 
re plane Again it shows clearly that NLS1s lie in the region
occupied by pseudo-bulges while BLS1 are spread over the
whole range of pseudo- and classical bulge properties
Finally we also look at the distribution of Sersic indices
with the FWHM of the broad component of H in Fig 7
While the sample is not large enough to make conclusive re-
marks we note the existence of a correlation of the FWHM
with the Sersic index conrmed by a Spearmans rank cor-

333 Complementary Studies
Three other studies support our conclusion about the bulges
of NLS1s
In studying the central engines of NLS1 galaxies
Ryan et al 2007 perform a bulge disk decomposition of 11
NLS1s galaxies with z 6 005 in the J-band and Ks-band us-
ing adaptive optics data from the 36m CFHT Their mean
Sersic indices are  nJ  152 and  nK  138 and
standard deviations n of  044 and  048 respectively
As the Sersic index seems to be at most weakly correlated
to the photometric band see eg Fisher  Drory 2008 who
compare the Sersic index in the V and in the H bands the
Ryan et al decomposition supports our results
In studying low black hole mass systems Greene et al
2008 argue that most of their disk galaxies have pseudo-
bulges Since these systems have small FWHMH they are
also likely to be NLS1s although the relative FeII strengths
they found are lower than in classical NLS1s Greene  Ho
In a more recent paper Mathur et al 2011 study 10
NLS1 galaxies ACSHRC using the F625W lter They
perform a similar bulge disk decomposition ie they t a
Sersic prole for the bulge and an exponential prole for the
disk and also conclude that they have pseudo-bulges While
our conclusions are based mainly on the Sersic index they
use the Kormendy relation as advised by Gadotti 2009
to conclude on the pseudo-bulge nature of NLS1 bulges In-
deed they do not nd systematically low Sersic indices but
obtain a mean Sersic index of  n  261 and a large Sersic
index dispersion n  182 In fact only six out of the ten
galaxies in their sample have Sersic index values consistent
with pseudobulge proles To try and understand this dif-
ference we note that the Mathur et al 2011 sample diers
from that presented by us here Specically their sample is
found at larger redshift  z  024 leading to a scale
in kpc on average 4 times larger than in our sample
A large scale limits how well the t is constrained by the
central regions and confusion in the light distributions be-
tween the nucleus and the bulge may arise possibly leading
to higher Sersic indices
One caveat to these works is the lack of a comparison
sample of BLS1 hosts which our results show is important
By including one we show that one should consider the hosts
of NLS1s to be a sub-set of all BLS1s rather than being
totally separate The distinction between NLS1 and BLS1
hosts is thus that while NLS1 hosts specically have pseudo-
bulges BLS1 hosts have a range of bulge types including
pseudo-bulges composite bulges and classical bulges
34 Secular evolution has always prevailed
The Sersic index distribution and the prominence of the
bulge both indicate that statistically NLS1 hosts have
pure pseudo-bulges in contrast to BLS1 galaxies The
consequence of this result Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004
is that internal secular processes must have dominated the
past evolution of NLS1 hosts And therefore it is from this
10 G Orban de Xivry et al
perspective that one should attempt to explain the particu-
lar AGN properties observed in NLS1 galaxies such as low
black hole mass high accretion rates etc
4 NLS1 EVOLUTION AND BLACK HOLE
We explore here the implications of our conclusion that sec-
ular processes have dominated the evolution of NLS1 galax-
ies We focus on the issue of the black hole growth of NLS1s
and in understanding whether or not NLS1 galaxies are in
a special phase of black hole growth
41 Expected galaxy populations that have
evolved through secular evolution
Over the last few years the relative importance of major
mergers versus minor mergers and secular processes in driv-
ing galaxy formation and evolution has become a key issue
in simulations and semi-analytic models Genel et al 2008
and Parry et al 2009 oer two dierent perspectives to un-
derstanding the growth processes of dark matter halos and
galaxies Both studies conclude that major mergers are not
necessarily the main driver of galaxy mass evolution
Genel et al 2008 investigate by analysing cosmolog-
ical simulations the growth of dark matter halos They ex-
tract halo merger fractions and mass accretion rates from
the Millenium simulation in order to study the possible role
of major mergers in the evolution of halos from z  2
to z  0 Following the fate of halos in the mass range
115 6 log Mz22 6 128 they nd that 13 of halos
which reach z0 have not undergone any major mergers
since z  22 and that such halos gain  70 of their new
mass via mergers less intense than 110 demonstrating the
importance of non-major merger processes In a following
paper Genel et al 2010 also show that independently of
halo mass  40 of the mass in halos have been assembled
through smooth accretion
Parry et al 2009 study galaxy growth by analysing
two dierent galaxy formation models both also based on
the Millenium simulation Their statistical results are reveal-
ing For both models they nd that only 649 of ellipti-
cals 63 of S0s and 62 of spirals undergo a main branch
major merger mass ratio greater than 13 in their entire
formation history In other words 98 of spiral galaxies
 which are the most common morphological type of NLS1s
host galaxies  do not undergo any major merger These
results are largely independent of total stellar mass of the
galaxy except for ellipticals In a further step they quantify
the relative impact of disk instabilities major mergers and
minor mergers on galaxy morphology by determining the
stellar mass fraction from each process as a function of the
total stellar mass For both models they nd that instabili-
ties and minor mergers are the main mass contributor with
their relative contributions depending on the treatment of
disk instabilities in the models see Parry et al 2009 and
references therein
While it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss the
treatment of the various physical processes in these galaxy
formation models one clear conclusion is that even hierar-
chical cosmological simulations give rise to large galaxy pop-
ulations that have evolved through secular processes Inter-
estingly observational studies also reach similar conclusions
Weinzirl et al 2009 study present day D  60Mpc
spiral galaxies By performing two dimensional multi-
component decompositions of 143 high mass M  1010 M
spirals they analyze the bulge Sersic index and BT distri-
butions Their results highlight the large fraction of bright
spirals having BT602 69 and n 6 2 76 where
many of them host bars 66 By comparing their result
to theoretical predictions they nd that  66 of present
day high-mass spirals have not undergone a major merger
since z 6 2 and likely not even since z 6 4 This conclusion
conveys the importance of minor mergers in the present
case for a mass ratio  1  4 and secular processes since
Finally Cisternas et al 2010 recently analyzed the
relevance of dierent triggering mechanisms for AGN activ-
ity Based on visual analysis of 140 AGN and 1264 inactive
galaxies with HST imaging they measure the fraction of
distorted morphologies which they take to be a signature of
recent mergers They conclude that the bulk of black hole
accretion has been triggered by secular processes and minor
interactions since z  1
By assessing the role of secular processes these various
theoretical and observational lines of evidence oer a cosmo-
logical context to our conclusions concerning NLS1 hosts
They show that a signicant fraction of galaxy mass and
a large number of galaxies have evolved from early cosmic
times without any mergers It is reasonable to suggest that
NLS1s which our analysis shows must have evolved without
mergers may be tracers of this population of galaxies Our
attempt in the rest of this section to put this hypothesis
on a more quantitative basis leads us to an estimate of the
duty cycle of NLS1s
42 How common are NLS1s
In the last decade various surveys of nearby galactic nuclei
have found that the fraction of objects classied as AGNs
is surprisingly large They show that of all local galaxies
approximately 10 are Seyferts and 40 can be considered
active see Ho 2008 and references therein
Looking at the NLS1s several surveys using opti-
cal and X-ray selected samples eg Williams et al 2002
Crenshaw et al 2003 Zhou et al 2006 nd that they make
up approximately 15 of Seyfert 1 galaxies Based on the
unied AGN scenario one can expect that this fraction
should apply also to type 2 Seyferts that 15 of Seyfert
2 galaxies may have narrow broad emission lines that are
hidden from sight by the obscuring torus Such a possibilty
has already been suggested by Zhang  Wang 2006 who
argue that Seyfert 2s without a hidden BLR ie one that
cannot be observed in polarised light are the counter-parts
of NLS1s Taking this further one could reasonably argue
that the NLS1 denition might extend even to the lower
luminosity AGN
Combining these fractions together leads to the assess-
ment that 26 of local galaxies could be NLS1-like galax-
ies ie active galaxies with narrow broad lines whether
obscured or not the evolution of which has been dominated
at all cosmic times by secular processes
The Role of Secular Evolution in NLS1 Galaxies
43 Duty cycle of NLS1 black holes
Our analysis in section 3 shows that NLS1 galaxies sta-
tistically have a bulge Sersic index nb  2 and a bulge-
to-total light ratio BT  2 The observational study of
Weinzirl et al 2009 corroborated by the theoretical study
of Parry et al 2009 argues that approximately 23 of lo-
cal spiral galaxies3 have similar properties to NLS1 hosts
Assuming that each galaxy among this population can po-
tentially undergo nuclear activity and become NLS1-like4
we can estimate the duty cycle of NLS1s We argue above
that NLS1-like objects may comprise as much as 6 of
local galaxies note that we use the upper end of the range
above in order to be conservative later in our estimates of
black hole growth This implies that their duty cycle should
be around 9

accretion driven by large-scale bars can only have occurred
in the last 77Gyr With a duty cycle of 9 this means
that NLS1s have actively accreted onto their BHs for
690Myr
Assuming their black holes are accreting at the Edding-
ton rate the e-folding time of their BH build-up is given by
the Eddington time-scale tE  44  108 yr Therefore the
black hole mass increase is given by eg Volonteri 2010 
MBHt  M seed
BH t0 expcid18 1  
tEcid19
where t is the current observed time and   t  t0 is
the total accretion duration since the initial time t0 The
radiative eciency  is a key parameter and can have a
major impact on the black hole growth rate because it is
inside the exponential term The standard value of  is  01
Adopting this then and assuming a seed mass M seed
BH t0 
 104M the current mass MBHt could range from
109 to 1010M On the other hand accretion onto a fast
rotating Kerr BH can lead to a radiative eciency   02
or higher Volonteri et al 2005 Jogee 2006 For the same
BH t0 this higher radiative eciency implies a much
slower BH growth and leads to current BH masses between
5  105 and 5  106M
Based on these very simple estimates we reach two con-
clusions Firstly NLS1s are not necessarily in a special phase
of their black hole growth Their black holes have required
78 Gyr to grow to their current size To increase their black
hole mass by another factor 10 requires  for a 9 duty cy-
cle and   02  another 28 Gyr Thus despite their high
Eddington ratios NLS1s are not imminently evolving into
BLS1s although they may do this eventually Secondly the
low BH masses of NLS1s with respect to BLS1s can easily

i  70 spirals
4 clearly the 23 of the local galaxies are not necessarily potential
true NLS1s but given that their hosts appear to have evolved
over cosmic time in a similar way they might be NLS1-like as
dened in Section 42 during their accretion phase
be accounted for by a high radiative eciency The theoret-
ical and observational evidence for rapidly spinning black
holes in NLS1s is the topic of the section 51
5 DISCUSSION
51 NLS1s and highly spinning black holes
As discussed in the last paragraph the radiative eciency
of the AGNs have a direct impact on their black hole growth
and their nal black hole masses But radiative eciency is
determined by the supermassive black hole SMBH spin
which in turn is inuenced by the AGN accretion his-
tory Dierent scenarios have been studied where SMBH
spins evolve through mergers subsequent prolonged accre-
tion constant angular momentum axis of the accreting ma-
terial eg Volonteri et al 2005 Berti  Volonteri 2008 or
chaotic accretion random disc orientations with respect
to the black hole eg King  Pringle 2007 King et al
2008 Berti  Volonteri 2008 Volonteri et al 2005 and
Berti  Volonteri 2008 have shown that if major and mi-
nor BH mergers are the sole source of material then the
distribution of BH spins in a z  0 galaxy population will
reect that of the initial seed BH spin In contrast they nd
that prolonged gas accretion triggered by galaxy mergers
tends to spin BHs up and that galaxies where a signicant
fraction of the BH growth occurs in this mode could have
maximal BH spin However in such a case most distant
quasars would have high radiative eciency and would in-
eciently grow their black hole This would require massive
BH seeds in conict with the Soltan argument If instead
the accretion proceeds by short randomly oriented events
King  Pringle 2007 King et al 2008 then the spins will
tend to be low and lead to high BH masses resolving the
conict with the Soltan argument But NLS1 BHs are likely
fed via secular rather than merger processes therefore the
angular momentum of the infalling matter could be related
to the host structure and hence have a favoured direction
NLS1 SMBHs could be evolving through the prolonged gas
accretion scenario Therefore NLS1 secular evolution would
imply high spins and low BH masses
From an observational point of view it appears to be
possible to derive BH spins using the Fe K line in the
hard X-ray continuum using accretion disk reection mod-
els While there are several potential reasons that might pre-
vent one from obtaining a good spin constraint for a given
source such as too few photons or too narrow iron line
hampering the t to pick out the role of relativistic con-
tributors Brenneman 2007 several recent works have been
able to derive formal constraints on BH spin for a num-
ber of Seyfert galaxies eg Brenneman 2007 Fabian et al
2009 Miniutti et al 2009 Ponti et al 2010 Among these
measurements we nd that most of them are for NLS1s
and that the derived spin values are very high While there
are still too few measurements to draw any rm conclusion
these results are already suggestive that NLS1s could have
highly spinning BHs owing to the prolonged disk accretion
onto their BHs
Finally as we have already touched on in section 43 a
high spin leads to a high mass-to-energy conversion or radia-
tive eciency because the last stable orbit is closer to the
12 G Orban de Xivry et al
horizon of the BH and hence to a slow BH growth There-
fore the high Eddington ratio typically observed in NLS1s
could be a signature not just of highly accreting BHs but
also of rapidly spinning BHs Given that pseudo-bulges are
one consequence of secular evolution in a galaxy and that
another consequence is that the SMBH should be rapidly
spinning our result that NLS1 hosts have pseudo-bulges
leads to the prediction that a large fraction of NLS1 BHs
should have very high spin Future X-ray missions may be
able to test this
52 Black hole - bulge scaling relation
One question concerning NLS1s that has received much at-
tention is whether they follow the MBH   relation or are
oset under it The MBH   or more generally the BH-
bulge scaling relations are often interpreted as physical evi-
dence for the co-evolution of the central BHs with the galac-
tic bulges The case of NLS1s is rather controversial On one
hand many studies suggest they may reside below the re-
lation in which case they could be evolving onto it eg
Mathur et al 2001 Bian  Zhao 2004 Grupe  Mathur
2004 Mathur  Grupe 2005ab Zhou et al 2006 On the
other hand several dierent studies place them on the rela-
tion once contaminating eects have been corrected for such
as OIII line5 broadening due to outows see Botte et al
2004 and Komossa  Xu 2007 or radiation pressure as
proposed by Marconi et al 2008
Current developments regarding the MBH   rela-
tion highlight that it may not be universal common to
all morphological types and that perhaps one should dis-
tinguish between barred and barless galaxies disks and el-
lipticals eg Graham 2008 Hu 2008 Graham  Li 2009
Graham et al 2011 classical bulges and pseudo-bulges
eg Nowak et al 2010 Sani et al 2011x Kormendy et al
2011 In fact barred disk galaxy bulges and pseudo-bulges
appear either to lie below the relation or to scatter around
it Additionally on a more theoretical side some authors
Peng 2007 Jahnke  Maccio 2011 suggest that the BH-
bulge scaling relations could be non-causal their origin
would not invoke a physical coupling between the SMBH
and the galaxy but rather would be naturally produced by
the merger-driven assembly of bulge and BH masses and
therefore galaxies with pseudo-bulges would not be expected
to obey the same relation Jahnke  Maccio 2011
Our result that NLS1s have pseudo-bulges suggests that
we should expect these AGN to lie in the same region as in-
active galaxies with pseudo-bulges that is scattered around
and below the MBH   relation It is not yet understood
how  or whether  black hole and bulge growth are linked
when secular processes drive their evolution Thus while it
is clear that their black holes are still growing we cannot
predict where they will end up on the MBH   plane
5 this line is often used as a surrogate of the stellar dispersion
 see Nelson 2000
53 Evolutionary scenarios
Several authors have suggested dierent links between NLS1
galaxies and other AGN types in evolutionary sequence con-
texts We briey discuss them in the light of our results
Mathur 2000 argues that NLS1 galaxies might be in
an early stage of evolution owing to their small growing
black holes and higher Eddington rates This proposition is
not inconsistent with our results Nevertheless it illustrates
a dierent perspective Either NLS1s would have their nu-
clear supermassive black holes recently formed and NLS1s
would be young objects evolving into BLS1s Mathur 2000
Mathur et al 2011 or NLS1s would not be in any special
phase of their evolution but simply have BHs that are grow-
ing slowly due to their duty cycle and spin However both
perspectives agree that NLS1s galaxies have pseudo-bulges
and that their black hole growth is driven by secular pro-
cesses as opposed to mergers at high redshift
Kawakatu et al 2007 proposed an evolutionary track
from type 1 ULIRG to NLS1 to BLS1 The connection be-
tween ULIRG and NLS1 appears contradictory with our re-
sults Indeed local ULIRGs are the result of galaxy merg-
ers while we have argued that based on the host properties
NLS1s have a secular driven evolution
Zhang  Wang 2006 study Seyfert 2s with and with-
out a hidden BLR ie presence or absence of BLR in polar-
ized light and suggest that non-HBLR Seyfert 2s are the
counterparts of NLS1s viewed at high inclination angles
In their subsequent paper Wang  Zhang 2007 propose
an evolutionary sequence of the narrow objects to broad
line AGN considering time evolution of the black hole mass
and the accretion rates While it is not inconsistent with
our results the distribution of bulge properties in BLS1s
suggests that not all BLS1s come from NLS1s that have
evolved secularly but that the BLS1 population should in-
clude galaxies that have undergone interactions and mergers
While Wang  Zhang 2007 propose a secular evolution
from NLS1s to BLS1s NLS1s would be an early AGN phase
and would evolve to BLS1s during the AGN activity time
Zhu et al 2009 proposed a similar scenario but where
NLS1s would be produced by mergers of smaller galaxies
compared to BLS1s and could evolve to BLS1s only if they
encounter more mergers to grow them This last scenario
appears contradictory to the results of the present paper
While at this point there is no consensus on the cos-
mic evolution of NLS1s our results suggest that they are
a special case in which the evolution has been dominated
at all time by secular processes Thus if the BHs in NLS1s
continue to grow they must eventually become broad-line
AGN and thus become part of the BLS1 population How-
ever our results also show very clearly that not all BLS1s
have grown in this way and that mergers have played a role
in the evolution of the BLS1 population In this respect per-
haps the most enlightening question would be when NLS1s
evolve into BLS1s will they be distinguishable from systems
classied as BLS1s but having undergone galaxy interactions
and mergers Perhaps one can already begin to address this
by studying the BLS1s with pure pseudo-bulges and asking
whether they have denable characteristics that dier from
the BLS1 population as a whole
The Role of Secular Evolution in NLS1 Galaxies
6 CONCLUSIONS
From a review of the literature we show that secular evolu-
tion in NLS1 galaxies is a powerful and on-going process on
all scales in contrast to BLS1 galaxies To assess the role
of secular processes in the past evolution of NLS1 galaxies
we examine their bulge properties by performing bulge-disk
decompositions on NLS1 and BLS1 galaxies with archival
HST images The results indicate that NLS1 host bulges are
pseudo-bulges and distinct from the much broader popula-
tion of BLS1 bulges From these results we conclude that
NLS1s represent a class of AGN in which the black hole
growth is and has always been dominated by secular evo-
lution
Such an evolutionary mode signies also a dierent
black hole growth mode in NLS1s than in merger-built sys-
tems Interestingly simulations of prolonged disk-mode gas
accretion onto black holes show that the most ecient way
to spin-up a black hole is through smooth accretion of ma-
terial In this light our results suggest that NLS1 galaxies
should possess highly spinning BHs which is indeed what
has so far been observed
Our picture of the NLS1 galaxy phenomenon can be
expressed as follows The activity in NLS1 galaxies is and
always has been powered by internal secular processes This
has lead to the growth of a pseudo-bulge It is also character-
ized by a disk-mode accretion onto the central object which
tends to spin up the black hole This leads to high radiative
eciency of the accreting material therefore reducing the
actual mass accreted onto the black hole and slowing its
growth The high radiative eciency could in part explain
the high Eddington ratios and small black hole masses of
This picture can be tested by analyzing the angular mo-
mentum in NLS1 bulges to assess denitively their pseudo-
bulge nature And studying the kinematics in the central
part of NLS1s would help to understand how gas is trans-
ported to their central regions what the mass inow rates
are and the role played by angular momentum In parallel
systematic measurements of black hole spins by future X-ray
missions would also shed light on the growth of their black
holes at the smallest scales

APPENDIX A SERSIC LIGHT PROFILE
The Sersic power-law intensity prole is frequently used in
the study of galaxy morphology It has the following func-
tional form eg Caon et al 1993 Peng et al 2010
Ir  Ie exp cid18 r
recid191n
 1 
where Ie is the surface brightness at the eective radius re
The parameter re is known as the eective or half-light
radius dened such that half of the total ux lies within re
The parameter n is the Sersic index with n  4 the prole
is the de Vaucouleurs prole typical of elliptical galaxies
n  05 gives a Gaussian and n  1 is the exponential
prole typical of disks Finally the parameter  is in fact
coupled to n and is not a free parameter
The exponential disk prole is more frequently de-
scribed by the compact form
Ir  I0 expcid18
rscid19 
where I0 is the central surface brightness I0  Iee and rs
the scale radius given by re  1678rs or more generally by
re  nrs
A1 Sersic luminosity ratios
The bulge-to-disk BD and bulge-to-total BT luminos-
ity ratios are relevant quantities for the study of galaxy
morphology These ratios tend to decrease from early- to
late- type spirals eg Masters et al 2010 The BD ra-
tio where the disk is described by an exponential prole
can be expressed analytically as
nb2nbe
and the BT as
cid18 qbR2
I0cid19 
dcid19cid18 Ie
nb2nbe2nb qbR2
nb2nbe2nb qbR2
b Ie  qdR2
where the subscripts b and d refer to the bulge and the disk
respectively Ie is the eective surface brightness of the bulge
and I0 is the central surface brightness of the disk Rb is the
eective radius of the bulge and Rd the scale radius of the
disk and qb qd are the axis ratios of the respective proles
To calculate the parameter  we use the analytic expansion
Equation 18 from Ciotti  Bertin 1999 valid for n  036
The Role of Secular Evolution in NLS1 Galaxies
the sky level the Sersic index value should be acceptable in
particular nb  8 and the physical radii Rb and Rd should
be reasonable
4 At the end of the third step we additionally look
at the radial proles of the model its components and the
original image These plots together with the radial residual
and the radial 2
 enable us to diagnostic possible problems
and identify inuences of non-tted structures Upon exam-
ination of these plots and the image residuals we decide
whether it is necessary to mask relevant structures such as
rings or spirals We rene the masks and the ts until the
radial prole of the model does not appear to be inuenced
by these structures but do translate correctly the bulge and
the disk components
While the Galfit outputs provide errors those are
purely statistical and are insignicant compared to system-
atic errors In the following sections we discuss the robust-
ness of our ts to dierent parameters the treatment of
additional structures deviation from idealized proles the
unprecise knowledge of the background level the core sat-
uration and the PSF Those parameters give indirect infor-
mation on the systematic errors Finally we give in Fig B2
and Fig B3 eight examples of our ts where we indicate by
open symbols the radial ranges entirely or partially masked
The radial residual and the radial 2
 given in the upper
panels also provide indirect information on the t errors
B1 Choice of tting range treatment of
additional structures
As already mentioned any nuclei is accounted for in the
ts by the use of a small Gaussian prole The alternative
consists of removing the nucleus from the t by masking
it Nevertheless with such a procedure the bulge-disk de-
composition is sensitive to the quality of the mask of the
nucleus and can also be aected by the reduced number of
constraints ie the bulge can be underconstrained if the
mask is too large Despite these considerations we try the
alternative and mask systematically the central region of
the images We use a default circular mask with 10 pix-
els radius adjusting it only in a few cases 428 to have
a minimum radius of 5 times the standard deviation  of
the Gaussian component 24 or to keep a reasonable num-
ber of constraints for the bulges 24 The median Sersic
index dierence between the ts with nucleus masked and
the ts with the nucleus included is reasonably small 022
and 029 for the NLS1 and BLS1 sample respectively This
test shows that to mask the nucleus instead of tting it by
a Gaussian component biases slightly the Sersic indices to
higher values Nevertheless except for a few cases 328 with
nb  2 and 228 with 2  nb  1 the increase remains
small acknowledging the robutness of the ts
As our samples are made of high resolution HST data
they also present many structural details The eect of de-
viations of surface brightness such as rings bars or spirals
are considered in the last step of our tting procedure step
4 Upon examination of the radial proles and the resid-
ual image we identify if any potential additional struc-
tures and manually create appropriate 2D masks We then
ret our model and iteratively adjust the mask according
to the radial prole and residual image We recognize that
this practice is subjective but nonetheless we believe it to
Figure B1 Our iterative tting procedure
APPENDIX B FIT PROCEDURE
To accomplish the bulge-disk decomposition we use the two-
dimensional prole tting algorithm Galfit Peng et al
2010 which allows by minimizing the 2 value to model
the light proles using eg Sersic proles
Since we t HST images we generate the PSFs with
the TinyTim6 code for the WFPC2 camera as well as the
F606W lter For each image we create a PSF referenced
to the galaxy center with an uniform weight along the wave-
length range
Initial parameters are estimated from visual inspection
of the images positions PA ellipticities radii etc Nev-
ertheless our iterative t procedure as described hereafter
ensure that the choice of initial estimates do not inuence
the nal results
Our procedure can be divided in 4 steps as summarized
in Fig B1 For each step we create appropriated masks to
remove regions from the ts
1 We start by tting only the disk of the galaxies using
an exponential prole and masking the central region
2 Once a reasonable model is obtained we t an ad-
ditional Sersic component to model the bulge Our initial
estimate of the Sersic index is nb  2 ie the index thresh-
old between pseudo- and classical bulges while the other
parameter initial estimates are based upon visual inspection
When tting we rst keep the outputs of our step 1 xed in
the t and then free to vary together with the Sersic prole
parameters During this step we mask only the core of the
galaxies 5 to 10 pixels radius to avoid possible inuence of
the central nucleus or AGN source
3 We then t an additional Gaussian with initial
FWHM of 25 pixels to model the AGN and iterate if
necessary until all parameters are free to vary As a non-
negligible fraction of the images presents a saturated core
with charges leakage along the columns 34 in total 50
in the NLS1 and 26 in the BLS1 samples we mask care-
fully these pixels We also verify the resulting FWHM of the
Gaussian and its axis ratio An additional motivation to use
a Gaussian instead of a PSF is to model any nuclear star
cluster which if not accounted for in the t will articially
increase the bulge Sersic index
During these three steps we judge the quality of the t
based on the residual images the 2 values and the param-
eters values ensuring that they are physically meaningful 
the magnitude of the components have to be greater than

inner rings  is a complex task and the t of any addi-
tional component requires more constraints which cannot
be provided by our single snapshot HST images indeed the
current bulgedisk models already give 2
  1 for most of
the ts The alternative practice of not masking these struc-
tures could lead to wrong results For example in the case
of MRK 42 presented in Fig B2 we rst do not mask the
inner-ring and obtain a compact bulge with nb  07 in our
step 3 while after masking the stucture we obtain a more
reasonable Sersic index nb  127 in our step 4 which 
according to the radial prole in Fig B2  is a much more
accurate model of the bulge Finally our iterative process
ensures that the regions we mask are physical additional
structures in the galaxies
B2 Background level
Given that the background may be coupled to the disk pro-
le an important aspect of bulge-disk decomposition is to
correctly x the sky level Since no precise sky measurements
are available for our HST images and that the galaxies lled

dierence  between the original and the model images the bottom plot presents the observed dots the total model solid line the

most of the eld of view we have to t the background
level together with the other components and minimize the
coupling with the disk prole Therefore we take a partic-
ular care to any additional light proles in the images such
as stars satellite galaxies or remaining large cosmic rays
These are carefully masked so to minimize their inuence
on the sky level Despite this particular attention we x the
sky level in 2 cases  MRK279 and MRK609 both part of
the BLS1 sample  at the value obtained in our step 1 ie
t of the disk and the background only If the sky is not
xed the resulting parameters are not physical in the case
of MRK 279 the background becomes negative and the ra-
dius of the disk excessively large in the case of MRK 609
the sky becomes extremely large and the disk and the bulge
shrink with nb  05
APPENDIX C RELIABILITY OF THE
BULGEDISK DECOMPOSITION
We analyze here possible eects inuencing our t results 
the core saturation in the images and the choice of PSF
18 G Orban de Xivry et al
As already mentioned a non-negligible fraction of the
images presents saturated core with charges leakage 50 in
the NLS1 sample and 26 in the BLS1 sample To minimize
any eect on our ts we mask carefully the saturated pixels
and the pixels aected by charges leakage Looking at the
Sersic indices we nd that galaxies with saturated core have
a mean Sersic index  nb  227 and galaxies without sat-
urated core have  nb  206 Therefore if the saturation
still aect our images it would tend to increase the Sersic
index As our NLS1 sample is more aected by saturation
than our BLS1 sample it would tend to increase the mean
Sersic index of NLS1s Consequently any remaining eect
of the saturation cannot account for the dierence between
NLS1 and BLS1 host bulge Sersic indices but would tend to
decrease it
We test the dependence of our t to the PSF used
for convolution by retting our NLS1 sample with dier-
ent PSFs The PSFs for this test are also generated with
TinyTim but instead of using an uniform weight along the
wavelength range they are produced at the central mono-
wavelength of the lter F606W The dierence in Sersic in-
dex ranges from 0 to 001 except for one object where it is
006 Therefore we conclude that the PSFs are not critical in
our ts and that our choice of using an uniform weight along
the wavelength range to create the PSFs with TinyTim is
acceptable
