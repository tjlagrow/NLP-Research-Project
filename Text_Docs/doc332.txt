ABSTRACT
In this paper we test the age matching hypothesis that the star formation rate
SFR of a galaxy of xed stellar mass is determined by its dark matter halo formation
history and as such that more quiescent galaxies reside in older halos This simple
model has been remarkably successful at predicting color-based galaxy statistics at
low redshift as measured in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS To further test
this method with observations we present new SDSS measurements of the galaxy
two-point correlation function and galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass
and SFR separated into quenched and star-forming galaxy samples We nd that
our age matching model is in excellent agreement with these new measurements We
also employ a galaxy group nder and show that our model is able to predict 1
the relative SFRs of central and satellite galaxies 2 the SFR-dependence of the
radial distribution of satellite galaxy populations within galaxy groups rich groups
and clusters and their surrounding larger scale environments and 3 the interesting
feature that the satellite quenched fraction as a function of projected radial distance
from the central galaxy exhibits an  r15 slope independent of environment The
accurate prediction for the spatial distribution of satellites is intriguing given the fact
that we do not explicitly model satellite-specic processes after infall and that in our
model the virial radius does not mark a special transition region in the evolution of a
satellite contrary to most galaxy evolution models The success of the model suggests
that present-day galaxy SFR is strongly correlated with halo mass assembly history

1 INTRODUCTION
One of the principal goals of galaxy evolution theory is
to understand the connection between the properties of
galaxies and their host dark matter halos There is now
2 Watson et al
a well-established relation between the stellar mass of
a galaxy and the mass of the halo in which it resides
eg Yang et al 2012 Leitner 2012 Wang et al 2012
Moster et al 2013 Behroozi et al 2013a Kravtsov 2013
Kravtsov et al 2014 Moreover the fact that the stel-
lar mass-to-halo mass connection remains tight across cos-
mic time Conroy  Wechsler 2009 Behroozi et al 2013b
Watson  Conroy 2013 Lu et al 2014 suggests that there
are likely further links between halo properties and the star
formation rate SFR of galaxies With this as motivation
the aim of the present work is to address the following ques-
tion is there a simple link between the SFR of galaxies and
the dark side of the universe
The complex nature of star formation in galaxies indi-
cates that the relationship between the SFR of a galaxy
and the properties of
its host dark matter halo may
be complicated First at xed luminosity or xed stel-
lar mass there exists a clear bimodality in the distri-
bution of galaxy colorSFR with distinct redquenched
and bluestar-forming populations Blanton et al 2003
Baldry et al 2004 Bell et al 2004 Blanton et al 2005
Cooper et al 2006 Wyder et al 2007 Wetzel et al 2012
Cooper et al 2012 Additionally galaxy colorSFR de-
pends on environment denser environments such as rich
groups and clusters are populated by signicantly more
red sequence galaxies than actively star-forming ones
Balogh et al 1999 Blanton et al 2005 Weinmann et al
2006 2009 Peng et al 2010 2012 Carollo et al 2013
Tal et al 2014 Furthermore the specic processes that
attenuate SFR in a central galaxy the galaxy at the
minimum of the halo potential well may be distinct from
those governing the satellite galaxies orbiting the central
van den Bosch et al 2008 Finally the SFRcolor depen-
dence of galaxy location within the cosmic web also mani-
fests in measurements of two-point statistics as a function
luminosity or stellar mass redquenched galaxies exhibit
stronger clustering than bluestar forming galaxies eg
Norberg et al 2002 Zehavi et al 2002 2005 Li et al 2006
Zehavi et al 2011 Yang et al 2012 Mostek et al 2013
Guo et al 2014a Such observed complexities may lead one
to conclude that complicated modeling of the physics gov-
erning the quenching of galaxies is required to reproduce
observed galaxy statistics
However in a pair of recent papers introducing the age
matching formalism Hearin  Watson 2013 Hearin et al
2014 hereafter Papers I  II respectively it was shown
that in fact a very simple model for galaxy color can ac-
count for the rich variety of trends exhibited by galaxies
in the low-redshift universe The central hypothesis of age
matching is that at xed luminosity or xed stellar mass
galaxy color is in monotonic correspondence with a proxy
for halo age at xed halo maximum circular velocity Vmax
In Paper I this prescription was shown to accurately re-
produce the observed g  r color-dependent clustering of
galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS York et al
2000 for the luminosity-selected galaxy samples presented
in Zehavi et al 2011 as well as the scaling between g  r
color and host halo mass In Paper II similar success of the
age matching formalism was demonstrated for model pre-
dictions of new measurements of both SDSS clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and g  r
However g  r color and star formation activity are
not perfectly correlated For instance galaxies that are ac-
tively forming stars can often appear red due to the ubiqui-
tous presence of dust eg Stein  Soifer 1983 Maller et al
2009 Masters et al 2010 Furthermore g  r color is the
convolution of many physical properties of galaxies includ-
ing stellar age metallicity and instantaneous SFR Thus
a model for the color-dependence of galaxy location within
the cosmic web may not smoothly translate to a model for
the SFR dependence In the present study we demonstrate
how age matching without modication to the technique
introduced in Papers I  II is equally successful at re-
producing new SDSS measurements of stellar mass- and
SFR-dependent clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing As we
will demonstrate in a forthcoming paper Watson Skibba 
Hearin 2014 in prep studying marked correlation functions
Skibba et al 2006 2013 this simultaneous success of our
model is primarily due to the surprising observational fact
that the two-point function is almost entirely insensitive to
the choice of SFR or g  r as a star formation indicator
Additionally in this paper we take a sharp focus on the
population of satellite galaxies While satellites are in the
minority by number the physics governing satellite galaxy
SFR is a key ingredient to painting a complete picture of the
theory of galaxy evolution Satellite galaxies can be subject
to a number of complex processes which are believed to stie
their star formation as they orbit within the gravitational
potential well of their host halo These include the removal
of cold gas from the disc due to ram pressure Gunn  Gott
1972 the stripping of the surrounding hot gas reservoir
known as strangulation Larson et al 1980 disruption of
satellite galaxies due to tidal stripping Purcell et al 2007
Watson et al 2012 and harassment by gravitational in-
teractions with other nearby galaxies Moore et al 1998
In age matching there is no explicit modeling of such
post-accretion processes And yet we will demonstrate that
this remarkably simple model accurately predicts the ra-
dial proles of star-forming and quenched satellite galaxies
within and around the environment of groups rich groups
and clusters As discussed in  5 the success of age matching
at reproducing these trends indicates that in much of the lit-
erature on satellite evolution the inuence of post-accretion
processes on quenching satellites has been over-estimated
The paper is laid out as follows In  2 we describe the
data simulation and halo catalogs incorporated through-
out this work An overview of the age matching and the
more generic conditional abundance matching formalism
is given in  3 In  4 we present our main results Speci-
cally in  41 we show our model predictions for new mea-
surements of the SFR-dependent two-point correlation func-
tion and galaxy-galaxy lensing signal In  42 we study
the spatial properties of star-forming and quenched satellite
galaxies within and around halos In  5 we provide a discus-
sion and interpretation of our ndings We conclude in  6
with a brief summary of our primary results Throughout
this work we assume a at CDM cosmological model with
m  027 and Hubble constant H0  70 km s1 Mpc1

2 CATALOGS AND MEASUREMENTS
As our baseline galaxy sample and halo catalogs are iden-
tical to those used in Papers I  II we only briey sketch
the essential elements of these catalogs here and refer the
reader to Papers I  II for further details
For our galaxy data we use a volume-limited galaxy
sample from DR7 of
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
York et al 2000 Abazajian et al 2009 spanning the
redshift range 002  z  0067 and complete to
log10 MM  98 We have identied galaxy groups in
this sample using the friends-of-friends algorithm presented
in Berlind et al 2006 for brevity we refer to this sample
as our M 98
SDSS group catalog
We have
cross-matched the M 98
catalog with
the specic star formation rate sSFR measurements
taken from the MPA-JHU catalog publicly available
at httpwwwmpa-garchingmpgdeSDSSDR7 The mea-
surements are based on the Brinchmann et al 2004 spec-
tral reductions that utilize the strength of H emission to
estimate present-day star formation activity along with up-
dated prescriptions for ber aperture corrections and ac-
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
tive galactic nuclei AGN as detailed in Salim et al 2007
Specically sSFRs are primarily derived from emission lines
mostly H but in the cases of strong AGN contamination
or no measurable emission lines the sSFRs are inferred from
Dn4000 in the galaxy spectrum Kaumann et al 2003
Our mock catalog is constructed from halos and subha-
los in the Bolshoi N body simulation Klypin et al 2011
based on publicly available ROCKSTAR merger trees and
halo catalogs Behroozi et al 2013ab1 The simulation has
a volume of 2503 h3Mpc3 with 20483 dark matter par-
ticles of mass 19  108h1M and a cold dark matter
CDM cosmological model with m  027   073
b  0042 h  07 8  082 For details on the Bolshoi
database see Riebe et al 2013
From the M 98
galaxy sample we present new mea-
surements of the two-point projected correlation function
2PCF and the galaxygalaxy lensing signal  as
a function of stellar mass and SFR Specically we di-

able at httphipaccucsceduBolshoiMergerTreeshtml

vide the galaxies into star-forming and quenched pop-
ulations by making a cut on the measured value of sSFR
at 1011yr1 The clustering and lensing measurements
are performed both observationally and in the simulation
in the same manner as described in detail in Paper II
We make our mock galaxy catalog publicly available at
httplogrusuchicagoeduaphearin
In order to investigate satellite-specic properties of
quenched and star-forming galaxies addressed in  42 we
rely on our galaxy group nder to designate central and
satellite galaxies in both the mock and the SDSS data
Specically in each identied SDSS group we label the
galaxy with the highest stellar mass as a central and all
remaining galaxies in the group as satellites In our mock
catalog we follow the exact same procedure By reproduc-
ing the same procedure in both SDSS data and mocks we
can compare the two without concern for group nding er-
rors in the centralsatellite assignment
3 METHODOLOGY
2004 Vale  Ostriker
Our main approach is to assign stellar masses and SFRs of
galaxies to subhalos within the Conditional Abundance
Matching CAM formalism as fully detailed in  43 Paper
II This formalism begins by using the abundance match-
ing technique eg Kravtsov et al 2004 Vale  Ostriker
2004 Tasitsiomi et al
Trujillo-Gomez et al 2011 Rodrguez-Puebla et al 2012
Watson et al 2012 Hearin et al 2013 Reddick et al 2013
Kravtsov et al 2014 to assign stellar masses to halos and
subhalos in Bolshoi to create a volume-limited SDSS mock
galaxy catalog In particular we abundance match the
exact stellar mass function of our galaxy sample against
the subhalo property Vpeak the highest circular velocity
a halo has had over its entire merger history using  015
dex of scatter in M at xed Vpeak using the algorithm
developed in Hearin et al 20132 Thus as a result of
this rst phase of implementation of the CAM technique
our model naturally inherits the well known successes of
traditional abundance matching which has been shown
to reproduce a variety of observations including galaxy
2PCFs Conroy et al 2006 Reddick et al 2013 close
pair counts Berrier et al 2006 Berrier  Cooke 2012
M  Mh relations Conroy  Wechsler 2009 Wang  Jing
2010 Guo et al 2010 Reddick et al 2013 and group
multiplicity functions Hearin et al 2013 We note that
Kravtsov et al 2014 recently demonstrated that im-
proved photometric techniques used to measure stellar
mass Bernardi et al 2013 lead to quite a signicant
eect on the stellar mass-to-halo mass relation predicted
2 Although it has recently been shown that Vpeak is typically
set during a major merger and therefore unlikely to be truly cor-
related with present day stellar mass in detail Behroozi et al
2013 the focus of the present paper is on predicting present
day SFR and so we consider rening the traditional abundance
matching algorithm beyond our scope However we note that
basing the stellar mass assignment on Vacc the maximum cir-
cular velocity of a halo when it accretes onto a larger halo thus
becoming a subhalo rather than Vpeak has a negligible impact
on the SFR predictions of the model
by abundance matching particularly for central galaxies
of halos at the high-mass end Mhalo  1014h1M We
intend to explore the inuence of this systematic in future
work when we comprehensively explore the age matching
parameter space
Once stellar masses have been assigned to our mock
galaxies we then proceed to model galaxy SFRs us-
ing CAM a general
formalism to study correlations
at xed mass between any galaxy property and any
halo property The fundamental quantity in CAM is
P M XgalVmax Xhalo the probability that a galaxy of
a given stellar mass M and galaxy property Xgal resides in
a halo with circular velocity Vmax and an additional halo
property Xhalo We choose the same specic implementation
of CAM known as age matching introduced in Paper I and
extended in Paper II In age matching the quantity Xgal
is either g  r color or sSFR and Xhalo is the halo prop-
erty zstarve which is characterized by certain epochs in a
halos mass accretion history MAH presumed to be linked
to the starvation of the cold gas supply needed to continue
fueling star formation These epochs include the redshift
a halo 1 accretes onto a larger halo 2 transitions from
the fast- to slow-accretion regimes halo formation redshift
zform for which we use the concentration-based approxima-
tion introduced in Wechsler et al 2002 and explain in detail
in Appendix A of Paper I and 3 reaches a virial mass
scale of 1012h1M Paper II demonstrated that 1 and
2 are highly correlated thus disregarding halo accretion
has proven to yield equally good model predictions Epoch
3 was introduced because the halo mass 1012h1M de-
marcates a characteristic mass scale above which star for-
mation is believed to become rapidly inecient due to
AGN feedback Shankar et al 2006 Teyssier et al 2011
Martizzi et al 2012 and to a lesser extent due to pressure-
supported shocks that can heat infalling gas to the virial
temperature Dekel  Birnboim 2006 A halo is assigned
a zstarve value based on whichever of these three epochs
occurs rst in its MAH3 formally written as zstarve 
Max zacc zchar zform
However one may wonder whether correlating galaxy
sSFR with zstarve is necessary at all in the construction of
a successful model This is due to the following chain of
logic 1 more massive halos host galaxies of greater stel-
lar mass 2 the quenched fraction increases with stellar
mass and therefore 3 quenched samples in a mock catalog
constructed by drawing random sSFRs without any zstarve
ranking will preferentially weight higher mass halos These
higher mass halos have earlier assembly times at xed stel-
lar mass and this so-called assembly bias has been shown
to aect the clustering of halos eg Wechsler et al 2002
We have performed such a test in Papers I  II as well
and have found that this eect alone is far too weak to yield
a working model This class of models that randomly draws
sSFRs from the data without any rank-ordering predicts
minimal dierence in the clustering between the quenched
and star-forming populations indicating that the eect of
halo assembly bias alone is not a strong enough mecha-
nism to yield a signicant enough split in the clustering see
3 For details on calculating zstarve from halo merger trees see
the appendix of Paper I
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Zentner Hearin  van den Bosch 2014 for a more compre-
hensive discussion
In this paper mock galaxies are assigned SFRs in the
same manner as they are assigned g  r colors in Paper II
for a given xed stellar mass bin sSFR values are drawn di-
rectly from the probability distribution function exhibited
by our galaxy catalog PSDSSsSFRM The collection of
halos and subhalos in the corresponding stellar mass bin are
then rank-ordered by zstarve such that the most quenched
galaxy will be assigned to the halo with the largest zstarve
value and so forth As seen in Fig 5 of Paper II the halo
formation epoch zform and hence halo age dominates the
contribution to zstarve over most of the stellar mass range
probed by our sample We choose to not adopt a simpler
model ie zstarve  zform for consistency in this trilogy of
papers and we reserve any model simplicationne-tuning
for future papers when we consider additional statistics
eg galactic conformity and push to other stellar mass
and redshift regimes In the end age matching simply posits
that quenched galaxies reside in old halos though the more
general CAM formalism allows for the exploration of any
galaxy-halo property correlation
The above procedure results in a mock galaxy catalog
whose sSFR distribution is by construction in exact agree-
ment with PSDSSsSFRM This agreement is illustrated
by the probability distribution functions PDFs in the top
left and bottom panels of Fig 1 We emphasize that the
purpose of the rank-ordering is to introduce at xed stellar
mass a correlation between galaxy SFR and zstarve How-
ever as was the case for color in Papers I  II our technique
only uses the property zstarve and PSDSSsSFRM to as-
sign SFRs to the mock galaxies but does not distinguish be-
tween central and satellite galaxies in the SFR assignment
In fact in age matching central and satellite galaxies of the
same stellar mass have dierent SFR distributions strictly
due to dierences in the assembly histories of host halos and
subhalos Therefore there is no guarantee that our PDFs
will be correctly predicted for the sub-populations of cen-
trals and satellite Nonetheless as can be seen in the top
middle and right panels of Fig 1 age matching does indeed
successfully predict central and satellite SFRs We return
to this point in  5 with the discussion of Fig 6
4 RESULTS
In this section we present our main results We rst demon-
strate in  41 that our age matching model reproduces our
new SDSS measurements of the projected galaxy 2PCF and
galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass and di-
vided into quenched and star-forming populations We then
focus squarely on results pertinent to quenched and star-
forming properties of satellite galaxies as measured from the
 SDSS group catalog Specically in  42 we compare
our model prediction for the radial distribution of quenched
and star-forming satellite galaxies within and around halos
corresponding to group- rich group- and cluster-size halos
We then examine the radial dependence of the quenched
fraction of satellite galaxies in such regimes

411 Clustering
We now investigate the success of age matching at predict-
ing SFR-dependent clustering Turning to the top row of
Fig 2 red and blue solid curves are our model predictions
for the quenched and star-forming galaxy samples respec-
tively Errors on the model wprp predictions are estimated
by jackkning the octants of the simulation box Red and
blue lled circles are new measurements from SDSS see Ta-
bles A1  A2 Errors on the measurements are computed
from jackknife resampling of 50 equal-area regions on the
sky A detailed description for how we calculate the clus-
tering in the data and in the simulation can be found in
 22 and  51 of Paper II respectively Our age matching
predictions for the SFR-dependent clustering are in excel-
lent agreement with the data at each stellar mass thresh-
old sample and all projected separations However as seen
in the top center panel of Fig 2 of Paper II there is a
slight under-prediction from abundance matching on small
scales rp  1h1Mpc for the log10M  102 threshold
sample This discrepancy naturally propagates through to
both the quenched and star-forming age matching predic-
tions top center panel where the clustering amplitude on
small scales is suppressed with respect to the data However
the relative quenched and star-forming split of the model
agrees well with that of the data
412 Lensing
In addition to clustering we also test our model against new
SDSS measurements of the SFR-dependent galaxy-galaxy
lensing signal  which are provided in Tables 3  4
In Paper II we describe how we calculate  both in the
data  24 and in the simulation  52 As was shown
in Fig 2 of Paper II we accurately predict  rst at
the abundance matching level though it should be noted
that the amplitude of the abundance matching prediction
for each stellar mass threshold is slightly boosted relative to
the data Thus we expect the age matching SFR-dependent
 amplitudes to be boosted for each sample as well This
is indeed the case as seen in the bottom row of Fig 2
SDSS data points for quenched and star-forming sam-
ples are represented as red and blue lled circles respec-
tively while red and blue solid curves are the model predic-
tions according to age matching Errors on the  model
predictions are computed via 27 jackknife regions over the
Bolshoi simulation volume Errors on the SDSS lensing sig-
nal are derived by dividing the survey area into 200 boot-
strap subregions and generating 500 bootstrap-resampled
datasets In light of the slight over-prediction of the model
at the abundance matching level the relative separation
in  between quenched and star-forming samples is pre-
dicted reasonably well for each stellar mass threshold with
the exception of the star forming samples on the very small-
est scales

42 Star-Forming and Quenched Satellite
Galaxies within Galaxy Groups Rich
Groups and Clusters
We now focus on results pertaining specically to satellite
galaxies By employing the same galaxy group nder to dis-
tinguish between central and satellite galaxies in both our
mock catalog and the SDSS sample see  2 for details of the
galaxy group nder we employ we investigate the radial
distribution of quenched and star-forming galaxies within
group- rich group- and cluster- size halos and their sur-
rounding larger scale environment We also study the ra-
dial dependence of the satellite galaxy quenched fraction
and test whether or not there is variation in the slope of the
prole for these three regimes
421 Radial Proles of Star-Forming and Quenched
Satellites
In our study of the radial proles of satellites we con-
sider three standard regimes groups rich groups and
clusters which we dene as having host halo masses of
101251325 10132514  and 101415h1M respectively
Host halo masses are assigned to groups in the traditional
abundance matching manner namely by matching the num-
ber density of Bolshoi host halos rank-ordered by Mvir to
the number density of the groups rank-ordered by total stel-
lar mass in the group This procedure is done separately for
the SDSS and mock catalogs for consistency
For each satellite in both the age matching mock and
SDSS data we measure rp the projected separation of the
satellite from the groups central galaxy For each group
we dene Rgroup to be the rms group size An alterna-
tive choice for group size would be the virial radius pre-

r015 slope independent of environment
galaxies are more centrally concentrated than their star-
forming counterparts There are in fact a larger total num-
ber of quenched than star-forming satellites at all scales
but here the PSFrpRgroup and PQrpRgroup are sepa-
rately unit-normalized in each host mass range thus high-
lighting the level of accuracy of the age matching model
with respect to the data In the bottom row of Fig 3 we
divide PSFrpRgroup by PQrpRgroup to highlight dier-
ences between the quenched and star-forming radial pro-
les Results for SDSS are shown as lled black circles and
black solid lines with gray error bands for the mock Poisson
errorbars are shown in all panels Other than a slight dis-
crepancy at very small projected separations for the galaxy
group halo mass scale there is excellent agreement between
our model and these measurements for all three host mass
regimes and at all projected separations
422 The Radial Dependence of the Satellite Galaxy
Quenched Fraction
Figure 4 shows the overall quenched fraction as a func-
tion of rpRgroup In each bin of rpRgroup we compute the
fraction of satellites found in that bin that are quenched
FQUENCHEDrpRgroup Again the result is compelling the
age matching prediction is in agreement with the data
on scales deep within the host halo of the group and
also extending out to scales well beyond the group radii
The overall amplitude of the radial quenched fraction in-
creases when going from the group to cluster regime as
has been seen in other studies eg Wetzel et al 2013
Additionally one can notice by eye that there is an ap-
parent lack of Mhostdependence of the slope of the pro-
les To investigate this more closely we separately normal-
ize the radial quenched fractions for satellites in each host
halo mass range ie each panel of Fig 4 by the overall
mean quenched fraction of satellites in groups of that mass
given as FQUENCHEDrpRgrouphFQUENCHEDi on the y-
axis of Fig 5 The result is an  r015 slope for the radial
quenched fraction of satellite galaxies independent of envi-
ronment
As emphasized in Papers I  II our age match-
ing model has required no parameter tting to achieve
the agreement between the predicted and measured SFR-
dependent galaxy statistics There is good agreement be-
tween our model and SDSS measurements for the predicted
clustering lensing and satellite-specic spatial distributions
within halos despite the fact that the SFR-halo assignment
in age matching has no explicit dependence on halo posi-
tion or post-accretion orbital history Thus in our mock
the SFR-dependent spatial distributions of both central and
satellite galaxies simply emerges as a result of the galaxy-
halo co-evolution ansatz
5 DISCUSSION  INTERPRETATION
51 Simplifying the Galaxy Evolution Picture
with Age Matching
The primary result of this paper is that the simple age
matching model in which galaxies and halos co-evolve such
that quenched galaxies reside in old halos is able to pre-
dict a wide variety of observed SDSS galaxy statistics for
quenched and star-forming galaxies In our model there are
1 no ne tuning or updates to the age matching model that
proved successful at reproducing color-based SDSS mea-
surements 2 no distinction between central and satellite
galaxies when assigning SFRs and 3 no explicit modeling
of post-accretion processes that are believed to stie the
star formation in satellite galaxies eg strangulation ram
pressure stripping etc
Let us consider these points in turn As discussed in  1
the color of a galaxy is known to be strongly correlated with
star formation activity For a variety of reasons though the
correspondence is not perfect For instance active galaxies
can often be classied as red due to the presence of dust
Maller et al 2009 Masters et al 2010 Color correlates
with long term mass accretion history in age matching be-
cause of the timescale  Gyr to evolve from the blue to
red sequence On the other hand the timescales relevant to
for example H indicators of SFR are signicantly shorter
than timescales impacting color eg  10100Myr for the
lifetime of O and B stars Therefore it is plausible that em-
ploying present day SFR in the age matching model may
not exhibit the same level of success as a model based on
g  r color
We have shown that this is not the case the SFR pre-
dictions of our age matching implementation of CAM are
equally successful as the color-based predictions from Pa-
pers I  II Certainly the relatively tight scatter between
g  r and sSFR is partly responsible for this dual success
In a follow-up paper to the present work Watson Skibba
 Hearin 2014 in prep we will show that the shortcom-
ings of using broadband color as a proxy for present day
star formation activity have virtually no manifestation on
the two-point function This surprising result interesting
in its own right provides further insight into the reason
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
that our model is able predict both g  r color and SFR
without modication The explanation for this is simple a
star-forming galaxy appears red when our line of sight to
the galaxy lies in the plane of its disk for a pair of galaxies
separated by r  100kpc the probability of this occurrence
is essentially independent due to the very weak correlation
between galaxy alignments Zhang et al 2013
Point 2 highlights the simplicity of age matching as
well as what drives the satellite quenching predictions of
the model Consider the implications of the left panel of
Fig 6 We use our mock catalog to show the average for-
mation epoch of centrals mock galaxies residing in host
halos in comparison to satellites subhalos As in Papers I
 II we use the Wechsler et al 2002 concentration-based
denition for the formation epoch of a halo In age match-
ing despite there being no distinction between central and
satellite galaxies when assigning a SFR satellite galaxies
are more quenched than their central galaxy counterparts
at xed stellar mass simply because subhalos form earlier
than host halos
The empirical justication for this cornerstone of age
matching is illustrated in the right panel of Fig 6 where we
show the dierence in the mean SFR of satellite and cen-
tral galaxies in bins of xed stellar mass For this gure we
now use the group-nder to identify centrals and satellites
permitting a direct comparison to observational data SDSS
measurements are shown as black lled circles and our age
matching model prediction is shown as the solid black line
with a gray error band all errors are Poisson At xed stel-
lar mass satellites are more quenched than centrals in both
the data and the model and the observed quenching dier-
ence is quantitatively consistent with the dierence implied
by the relative formation times of host halos and subhalos
This observation is closely connected to point 3 Age
matching does not require any explicit modeling of post-
infall eects on satellite galaxy quenching The virial radius
Rvir of host halos only enters into our model through the
denition of zacc the epoch when a halo accretes onto a
larger halo thus becoming a subhalo However recall that
in age matching SFR is determined by zstarve the redshift
in a subhalos MAH when it is deemed to be starved of
the cold gas supply needed to continue fueling star forma-
tion Formally zstarve  Max zacc zchar zform and as we
showed in Paper II the epoch zacc has an essentially negli-
gible impact on zstarve at all stellar masses a result which
also holds true in the present work Thus in our model Rvir
does not mark a special transition region in the evolution of
a satellite and yet we accurately predict the radial proles
of quenched and star-forming galaxies both inside and well
beyond the group radius as well as the so-called excess
quenched fraction of satellites right panel of Fig 6
This qualitatively distinguishes age matching from con-
ventional semi-analytic and empirical models of satellite
quenching We note however that the lack of explicit ap-
pearance of Rvir in our model does not imply that post-
accretion processes are necessarily irrelevant to satellite
quenching since there is a signicant correlation between
the time a subhalo accretes onto a larger halo and the time
the subhalo formed see Fig 6 of Paper II rather that the
overallin uence of post-accretion physics has been over-
stated in the literature Nonetheless we will show in a pair
of companion papers to this one that recent observations

Predicting Galaxy Star Formation Rates
of SFR trends in the low-redshift universe do favor a sce-
nario in which quenching is impacted by physical processes
that operate on scales far larger than Rvir even for central
galaxies as discussed in the following section
52 Discriminating between Competing
Quenching Models
As discussed in detail in Zentner Hearin  van den Bosch
2014 the success of age matching has exposed funda-
mental degeneracies in traditional approaches to galaxy-
halo modeling such as
the Halo Occupation Distri-
bution HOD eg Seljak 2000 Cooray  Sheth 2002
Berlind  Weinberg 2002 Berlind et al 2003 Zheng et al
2005 Skibba  Sheth 2009a Watson et al 2010 2012 and
Conditional Luminosity Function CLF eg Yang et al
2003 van den Bosch et al 2013 While it is true that
age matching is based on Vmax to set the stellar mass
or luminosity content of halos the assignment of the ad-
ditional galaxy properties of color or SFR is based on
halo assembly history Conversely HOD modeling beyond
just stellar mass- or luminosity - dependent clustering
ie the color or SFR dependence eg Zehavi et al 2005
2011 Skibba  Sheth 2009b Tinker et al 2013 Guo et al
2014b is still exclusively governed by Mvir and no other
halo property And yet both classes of models give very
good descriptions of a wide variety of measurements of the
galaxy distribution
These considerations apply equally well to degenera-
cies with other common models of galaxy evolution Indeed
both HODs and CLFs enjoy comparable levels of qualitative
successes in reproducing observed statistics such as those
presented in this work and the previous age matching pa-
pers There is thus some legitimate cause for concern that
conventional statistics describing the galaxy distribution are
inadequate to conclusively discriminate between competing
models One particularly interesting measurement is that
of galactic conformity a feature in the galaxy distribution
rst discovered by Weinmann et al 2006 In their analysis
of an SDSS galaxy group catalog Weinmann et al 2006
showed that in group systems of the same halo mass satel-
lites in groups with a red central tend to be redder than
satellites in groups with a blue central In another recently
reported detection of conformity Kaumann et al 2013
showed that in an SDSS sample of central galaxies of the
same stellar mass the environment surrounding quenched
central galaxies exhibits on average an attenuated SFR
relative to the environment around star-forming centrals
a correlation that persists out to scales of R  5Mpc far
outside the virial radius of the host halo of the centrals
Hearin Watson  van den Bosch 2014
closely
related signals are formally distinct
in the following
sense the Weinmann et al 2006 notion of conformity
pertains to SFR correlations between central and satellite
galaxies in the same dark matter halo while the larger
scale Kaumann et al
2013 signal pertains to SFR
correlations in distinct halos We contend that no galaxy
evolution model in which central galaxy SFR is exclusively
determined by halo mass Mvir and subsequently virial
radius Rvir can account for either signal as there would be

no mechanism by which such correlations could arise How-
ever in age matching galaxies in the same environment
evolve from collapsed peaks of the same region of the initial
cosmic density eld Thus the known correlation between
the formation times of nearby halos eg Sheth  Tormen
2004 Wechsler et al 2006 naturally gives rise to corre-
lated stellar mass assembly histories of nearby galaxies In
Hearin Watson  van den Bosch 2014 we demonstrate
that age matching predicts galactic conformity of both
the Weinmann et al 2006 and Kaumann et al 2013
varieties with no modications to the model presented in
this work Since it was shown in Kaumann et al 2013
that the Guo et al 2011 semi-analytic model SAM
does not predict conformity this signal appears to be a
promising testbed for the further development of galaxy
evolution models5
53 Future Directions
This trilogy of age matching papers has revealed that there
is a surprisingly simple relationship between the star for-
mation activity of a galaxy and the assembly history of its
dark matter halo However there are two clear paths to
challenging the age matching picture of galaxy and halo co-
evolution First our model has only been tested for central
and satellite galaxies of log10M  98 However using ob-
servations of classical dwarf galaxies in SDSS Geha et al
2012 discovered that there is an apparent stellar mass
5 For example the pre-heating of gas in the inter-galactic
medium implemented in the SAM recently introduced in Lu et al
2014 is a promising mechanism by which conformity may arise
as discussed in Kaumann et al 2013
threshold of log10M  90 below which quenched galax-
ies do not exist in the eld In a recent study of this SDSS
dwarf sample Wheeler et al 2014 demonstrated that the
so-called quenching timescale after a satellite rst crosses
the virial radius Rvir of its host halo must be implausibly
long  9Gyr to produce the trends reported in Geha et al
2012 These results are intriguingly in keeping with the
notion supported by age matching that the role of Rvir has
been over-estimated in the literature In future work we
aim to apply the CAM modeling technique to dwarf galaxy
samples to investigate whether the SFR trends exhibited by
galaxies in this mass range are also reected in a simple way
by the evolutionary history of dark matter halos
The second consideration will be confronting age
matching with observations at higher redshift We will soon
take this crucial next step thanks to high-completeness
data sets such as PRIMUS Coil et al 2011 GAMA
Driver et al 2011 and VIPERS Guzzo et al 2013
Ultimately the power of this class of semi-empirical
models is their ability to be used as training sets to help
inform more complicated models of galaxy formation that
include prescriptions for physical processes a priori Speci-
cally SAMs and hydrodynamic simulations can draw insight
from age matching in order to improve their input physical
recipes
6 SUMMARY
In this paper we have explored the hypothesis that the star
formation rates SFRs of galaxies can be determined via
the ansatz that galaxies co-evolve with their dark matter
halos Specically we have studied the age matching for-
malism introduced in Hearin  Watson 2013 whose cen-
tral tenet is that redquenched galaxies reside in old halos
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
and conversely for bluestar-forming galaxies This simple
formalism has been proven to be remarkably powerful yield-
ing accurate predictions of SDSS color-dependent clustering
and galaxy-galaxy lensing as well as a variety of galaxy
group-based statistics In this work have confronted our
age matching formalism with SFR-dependent low-redshift
galaxy statistics Specically we have found the following
principal results
 We present new measurements of SDSS clustering and
galaxy-galaxy lensing as a function of stellar mass split
into distinct quenched and star-forming populations The
same age matching prescription introduced in Paper I and
extended in Paper II adapts seamlessly to accurately pre-
dict these SFR-dependent observations without necessitat-
ing updates to the model or ne-tuningtting of parame-
 Age matching predictions are in excellent agreement
with the observed radial distribution of star-forming and
quenched satellite galaxies within and around galaxy group
rich group and cluster environments a success that extends
signicantly beyond the group radius
 We demonstrate the lack of halo mass-dependence in
the slope of the radial quenched fraction of satellites nding
an  r15 gradient independent of environment
 We make our mock galaxy catalog publicly available at
httplogrusuchicagoeduaphearin
These ndings provide compelling evidence for the co-
evolution of halos and galaxies and are highly sugges-
tive of the conclusion that the existing literature has over-
estimated the role of post-accretion processes on attenu-
ating star formation in satellite galaxies We consider the
myriad successes of our model to indicate that there does
indeed exist a simple relation between cosmic star formation
history of galaxies and the dark side of the universe

Table A3 SDSS GALAXY-GALAXY LENSING MEASUREMENTS STAR-FORMING GALAXIES The rst column
is the mean radii of galaxies in each logarithmic bin in units of kpc Subsequent columns show the galaxy-galaxy lensing signal  in
units of Mpc2 for the same three stellar mass volume-limited threshold samples Errors in the parenthesis are derived from dividing
the survey area into 200 bootstrap subregions and generating 500 bootstrap-resampled data sets
