1 Early work on radiative transfer models for infrared sources
During the 1960s and early 1970s very simplistic models began to be developed for
infrared sources associated with circumstellar dust shells HII regions and star-forming
regions These models assumed that the dust grain density nr and temperature Tr
have a power-law dependence on radius r and that the dust is optically thin Scattering
was neglected and so the emission was simply calculated as a sum of nrQ BT r
integrated over r
The rst complete solution of the spherically symmetric radiative transfer problem for
an optically thick dust cloud was by Leung 1975 He used detailed grain properties and
carried out a full solution of the moment equations including anisotropic scattering The
grain temperature was solved for by assuming radiative balance Yorke and Krugel 1977
modelled the dynamical evolution of an HII region including the interaction between gas
and dust Radiative transfer was approximated by diusion These two papers marked a
tremendous step forward in the quality of models for infrared sources To take advantage
of numerical techniques which had been used in modelling stellar atmospheres Leung
essentially assumed that the radiation eld is isotropic through most of the cloud the
Eddington approximation
Rowan-Robinson 1980 carried out a numerical solution of the full radiative transfer
equation The intensity I  r was calculated throughout the cloud using a grid of
values in  r  This showed that the Eddington approximation is a poor assumption
throughout a dust cloud and revealed the phenomenon of sideways beaming of the radi-
ation eld at the inner edge of cloud Viewed from a distance a dust cloud surrounding
a star should show a ring of bright emission in the mid infrared coming from the inner
edge of the dust cloud A second interesting phenomenon revealed by a full solution of
the radiative transfer equation is that of back radiation onto the star The dust cloud
radiates at the star and so the net spectrum of emission emerging from the star is no
longer a blackbody but has absorption bands at the wavelengths of dust emission fea-
tures Rowan-Robinson 1982 Rowan-Robinson and Harris 1982 1983ab applied this
code to all the bright circumstellar dust shells in the AFGL survey

2 Physical assumptions
In modelling the infrared spectrum of star-forming regions and of galaxies the key
issues are the nature of the dust grains and their spatial distribution A range of grain
species and grain radii are needed to account for the main observed features of the inter-
stellar dust extinction prole with wavelength carbonaceous grains silicates and PAHs
While the larger grains tend to be amorphous in most astrophysical environments the
smaller grains may be crystalline and the very smallest grains the PAHs are essentially
large molecules The possibility that the dierent grain species may be aggregated into
larger fractal-like structures has not been much explored
The earliest radiative transfer models were targeted at either circumstellar dust shells
or HII regions associated with massive star formation For the latter the assumption of
spherical symmetry is valid for the early compact phase of HII region evolution But
many of the more evolved HII regions show a blister-like geometry as the HII region
breaks out of the parent molecular cloud A starburst in a galaxy will involve stars in
both stages of development as well as in the later supernova phase Not many published
models attempt to capture this variety of geometries In ultraluminous infrared galaxies
we are almost certainly dealing with multiple star-forming clouds so the heating of a
cloud by its neighbours can probably not be neglected and a full 3-D treatment is needed
When we look at the wonderful images of the Milky Way produced by the Herschel
mission we can not fail to be struck by the chiaroscuro distribution of the dust We see a
complex alternation of optically thick and optically thin regions illuminated from many
directions At the very least a clear distinction between optically thick dust clouds and
the optically thin intervening medium needs to be maintained in the models
3 Spherically symmetric radiative transfer models for starbursts
Despite their rather limited physical validity it is not surprising that spherically sym-
metric radiative transfer models have been widely deployed in the literature for massive
star-forming regions eg Krugel and Siebenmorgen 1994 Silva et al 1998 Efstathiou
Rowan-Robinson and Siebenmorgen 2000 made such models slightly more realistic by
following the evolution of a spherically symmetric HII region within a dense molecular
cloud They assume an embedded phase lasting for 107 years Following the stars explo-
sion as a supernova the evolution continues as an expanding neutral shell lasting from
107 to 108 years At 108 years the emergent spectrum is virtually indistinguishable from
that of the general optically thin interstellar medium the cirrus The time-sequence of
SEDs calculated by Efstathiou et al 2000 poses the interesting question can we identify
starbursts of dierent ages observationally see section 8 below 
Subsequent work on radiative transfer models for starbursts includes the models of
Takagi et al 2003 which includes distributed stars and dust satisfying a King law
the programme of Dopita et al 2005 2006ab Groves et al 2008 which incorporate
detailed HII region physics and the large library of parameterised models generated by
Siebenmorgen and Krugel 2007
4 2-D axially symmetric radiative transfer models for infrared
sources
The problem of radiative transfer in an axially symmetric dust cloud was rst solved by
Eftstathiou and Rowan-Robinson 1991 and applied by them to the problem of models
Panchromatic radiation from galaxies
for protostars More recent axially symmetric models for protostars have been developed
by Whitney et al 2003 2004
Axially symmetric radiative transfer models for AGN dust tori were developed by Pier
and Krolik 1992 Granato and Danese 1994 and Efstathiou and Rowan-Robinson
1995 The main issue addressed by these papers was why we do not see the 10 m
silicate feature strongly in emission from Type I QSOs Granato and Danese proposed to
solve this by reducing the abundance of silicon while Efstathiou and Rowan-Robinson
suggest that a tapered disk geometry shields the hot dust from our direct line of sight
High quality mid infrared spectra from the Spitzer IRS for a large sample of starbursts
and AGN allow us to test these ideas Rowan-Robinson and Efstathiou 2009 have
shown that the suite of starburst models of Efstathiou et al 2000 and AGN dust tori
models of Efstathiou and Rowan-Robinson 1995 successfully explain the distribution of
starbursts and AGN in the diagnostic diagram proposed by Spoon et al 2007 97 m
silicate depth versus 62 m PAH equivalent width Fig 1 While there is aliasing of the
models in this diagram since dierent combinations of starburst and AGN dust torus
models can predict the same point in the diagram the model sequences do populate the
distribution of observed points well In particular the range of AGN dust tori silicate
optical depths from very deep absorption to weak emission is well matched It will be
interesting to model the individual spectra to gain a more precise determination of the
model parameters
5 3-D radiative transfer models for clumpy AGN dust tori
A rst attempt to approximate a fully 3-dimensional radiative transfer was made by
Rowan-Robinson 1995 who argued that the dust torus around AGN might comprise
a large number of small but optically thick clouds The emission from the clouds was
approximated by a slab model and because these clouds are found to be approximately
Figure 1 97 m silicate depth versus 62 m PAH equivalent width for starbursts and
AGN Spoon et al 2007 The observed points are well represented by the grid of models

isothermal the absence of a 10 m emission feature could be explained Nenkova et al
2002 2008 advocated a 5-10 clump model for NGC1068 also using a slab treatment
of the radiative transfer
Fully 3-dimensional radiative transfer codes based on Monte Carlo methods have been
developed by Dullemond and van Bemmel 2005 Shartmann et al 2005 2008 and
Hoenig et al 2006 These codes have the capacity to fully track the observed chiaroscuro
of the dust distribution in galaxies and AGN
6 Radiative transfer models for quiescent disk galaxies cirrus
For optically thin dust in the interstellar medium of galaxies we only need to ensure
thermal balance between the grains and the interstellar radiation eld The earliest ra-
diative transfer model proposed for the cirrus component in galaxies found by IRAS was
given by Rowan-Robinson and Crawford 1989 who modelled all IRAS galaxies detected
in all four IRAS wavebands in terms of three components an M82-like starburst an AGN
dust torus and a cirrus component This cirrus model was extended by Rowan-Robinson
1992 who found that the key parameter in characterising the cirrus spectrum was the
ratio of the intensity of the radiation eld to that of the solar neighbourhood  The
shape of the spectrum of the interstellar radiation eld was of less importance
Silva et al 1998 substantially improved this treatment by modelling the interstellar
dust in galaxies as a spheroidal distribution Regions of massive star formation were
modelled with a spherically symmetric code to generate a combined cirrus and starburst
SED A chemical evolution code followed the star formation rate the gas fraction and
metallicity with the gas being divided between the star-forming molecular clouds and
the diuse medium Further detailed models of spiral galaxies have been developed by
Popescu et al 2000 2011 Misiratis et al 2001 Dale et al 2001 Tus et al 2004
Piovan et al 2006
Efstathiou and Rowan-Robinson 2003 developed a simple suite of cirrus models for
local galaxies assuming an optically thin interstellar medium characterised by the ex-
tinction AV not  1 The radiation eld was determined by Bruzual and Charlot
1993 starburst models parameterised by the age t and an exponential decay time 
for local galaxies t  025 Gyr   5-11 Gyr Galaxies are then characterised by a
single mean intensity   bolometric intensitysolar neighbourhood intensity They also
found that cirrus models with slightly higher AV and    2-3 times higher can also
t high-z galaxies from the SCUBA blank-eld surveys Restricting analysis to SCUBA
sources a which have been conrmed by submm interferometry or b sources from 8
mJy survey which have radio associations they found that 70 of submillimetre galax-
ies 1623 were successfully modelled by cirrus model More recently Efstathiou and
Siebenmorgen 2009 have conrmed this result by modelling 12 submillimetre galaxies
which have IRS spectroscopy They found that 3 were tted with a pure cirrus model
the rest with a combined cirrusstarburst model
7 Infrared templates
Several groups have generated suites of models for starbursts AGN dust tori and for
quiescent cirrus galaxies and these have been applied to modelling the infrared and
submillimetre SEDs of hundreds of thousands of galaxies Typically each component has
two or three key parameters for starbursts the initial optical depth and the age for
AGN dust tori the inclination and torus geometry and for cirrus  and perhaps the
SED of radiation eld It is beyond the scope of this short review to try to review all
Panchromatic radiation from galaxies
these SED modelling eorts Instead I pick out a couple of issues that have emerged from
modelling galaxies detected by Herschel
The rst question is are we beginning to be able to recognise young starbursts 
Rowan-Robinson et al 2010 nd a number of galaxies in the Herschel-Hermes survey
which seem to require a young starburst model Fig 2L Secondly how can we understand
the very cold dust that seems to be seen in some Herschel and Planck galaxies  Fig
2R shows a number of relatively local galaxies which seem to require cirrus components
with   1 This is not too startling since such galaxies were noted by Rowan-Robinson
1992 in the IRAS data What is surprising is that there also seem to be some galaxies
with   01 If this really is optically thin dust then it must come from extended dust
distributions on scales of tens of kiloparsecs Bendo 2012 this volume argues that the
cool dust seen in the outer regions of nearby galaxies is heated by evolved stars not star
formation Such cool dust may be seen in dwarf galaxies Madden 2012 this volume
an example is the dwarf galaxy NGC1705 studied by OHalloran et al 2010 for which
they estimate a dust temperature of 58 K
8 Evolution of galaxies - the infrared view when was the rst
infrared light 
Turning to the evolution of galaxies over cosmological times the search for high redshift
z5 galaxies is highly dependent on spectral synthesis models matched to near infrared
photometry Schaerer 2012 this volume Leitherer 2012 this volume has given a very
nice review of issues in stellar spectral synthesis
One further issue is that dust is a potential source of aliasing in z5 photometric
redshifts since extinction of radiation shortward of the Balmer break can mimic the
Lyman break Young stars forming today are emerging from AV  100 clouds What
is the likely dust optical depth in star-forming clouds at high redshift  We know that

quasars at z6 already have carbon so these regions have already formed stars and
some have submillimetre emission so dust has formed
When was the rst rest-frame infrared light  Current ideas suggest that reionization
took place between z  11 and z  6 the rst stars formed at z  30 and the rst galaxies
at z  10-20 How long did it take to get AV  1 in star-forming clouds and hence most
starlight being reprocessed into the infrared 
If supernovae make enough dust to provide this opacity then we need only 106 years
from the formation of the rst normal massive stars However if we need AGB stars to
make the dust then we need at least 109 years It is interesting to note that 1 Gyr from
z10 would be z4 so redshift 4 is not an unreasonable estimate for the moment when
star formation starts to be universally a far infrared phenomenon
In principle we can learn a lot about this era from dwarf galaxies with metallicity
extending down to 130th solar The halo of our Galaxy also has stars with even lower
metallicity which could be from the z10 era
9 Submillimetre galaxies
The rst z  2 IRAS galaxy IRAS F102144723 turned out to be bright at 850 m
Rowan-Robinson et al 1991 1993 Franceschini et al 1994 pointed out that the neg-
ative K-correction at submillimetre wavelengths makes these a window to high redshift
However the observed redshift-distribution of submillimetre galaxies peaks at z  2-3
Chapman et al 2005 Source-count models seem to need a redshift cuto at  4 to
explain 850 and 1100 m counts see section 12 The Herschel-Hermes survey detects
plenty of z  3 galaxies eg Rowan-Robinson et al 2010 and Herschel-ATLAS has de-
tected a z  42 starburst galaxy Cox et al 2011 But it still seems surprising that we
have not detected more z  4 submillimetre galaxies
Blain 1996 emphasised that gravitational lensing could be a big factor in explain-
ing the high luminosities of submillimetre galaxies It is true that a signicant fraction
Figure 3 Mean AV versus z for galaxies in HDFN Rowan-Robinson 2003 Curves are from
closed box instantaneous recycling models for the evolution of gas and dust in galaxies
Panchromatic radiation from galaxies
of IRAS hyperluminous infrared galaxies are lensed Rowan-Robinson and Wang 2010
estimate the lensed percentage to be 10-30 Negrello et al 2010 show 5 lensed galax-
ies from the Herschel-Atlas survey They estimate that a signicant fraction 50 of
bright 100mJy 500 m sources are lenses and predict that more than 100 lenses will
be found The combination of the negative K-correction and gravitational lensing should
make it relatively easy to search for z  4-6 infrared galaxies if they are common
10 Star formation history
Madau 1996 used the Lilley et al 1996 survey and data from the HDF to estimate
star-formation rate as a function of redshift Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 used ISO
data to derive much higher star-formation rates in the range z  0-1 ie star-formation
rates derived from ultraviolet and optical data need a strong dust correction In using
the far infrared luminosity to estimate star-formation rates it is important to correct for
heating by evolved stars Bell 2003 Rowan-Robinson 2003a With this correction the
far infrared luminosity is a good estimator for the obscured star formation rate A recent
summary of estimates using dierent methods has been given by Hopkins 2007 The
mean star-formation rate increases steeply from z  0-1 peaks at z  1 - 25 and then
declines towards higher redshift This star-formation history can then be used to predict
how the mean extinction in galaxies should vary with redshift Rowan-Robinson 2003b
Rowan-Robinson et al 2008 Fig 3 shows observed points from a study of photometric
redshifts in the Hubble Deep Field The curves are closed box galaxy models with constant
yield instantaneous recycling and a star-formation history consistent with the observed
history and in which all heavy elements are assumed to be in dust
11 Stellar mass star formation rate dust mass
The importance of modelling infrared and submillimetre SEDs with radiative transfer
models is that key secondary parameters like star-formation rate and dust mass can be
Figure 4 Dust mass versus stellar mass at z  025 and 15  25 for galaxies in the SWIRE
survey Rowan-Robinson et al 2008 Galaxies detected at z  2 in infrared surveys are much
dustier and have much higher specic star formation rate than their local counterparts
Michael Rowan-Robinson
extracted From stellar spectral synthesis models for optical and near infrared SEDS the
stellar mass can be calculated For example the SWIRE Photometric Redshift Catalogue
provides over 1 million redshifts Rowan-Robinson et al 2008 For most of these stellar
masses are estimated For those detected at 8 or 24 m 25  of the catalogue the
star-formation rate and dust mass are estimated as well as the luminosities in each
contributing component to the SED t Recently a new version based on improved and
extended photometry has been made available

From stellar synthesis models we can determine ML36 and then use L36 to
get M The evolution of ML36 with time is approximated as  a  bt06 which
is found to be accurate to 5
For starbursts we can estimate the star-formation rate from Myr  22 x
1010L60L Rowan-Robinson 2001 The specic star formation rate M is then
a measure of t1
sf  the inverse of the time to generate the observed stellar mass forming
stars at the current observed rate
From radiative transfer models for the infrared templates we can estimate mass of
dust Mdust in each component and sum this Figure 4 shows the dust mass versus
stellar mass in two dierent redshift ranges Infrared galaxies at z  2 have both higher
specic star-formation rates and dust masses compared to local galaxies
12 Far infrared and submillimetre source-counts
An important way to constrain the star-formation history and AGN evolution history
of galaxies is through models for infrared and submillimetre source-counts and the inte-
grated background radiation Recent source-count models which try to t source-counts
across the infrared and submillimetre band include those by Rowan-Robinson 2009
Valiante et al 2009 and Bethermin et al 2011 My models appear to require a redshift
cuto at around z  4 to be consistent with submillimetre counts and the background
radiation
Oliver et al 2010 have presented counts from the Herschel-Hermes survey at 250
350 500 m and nd that the counts together with a PD analysis account for a large
fraction of infrared background Amblard et al 2011 have analysed clustering in the
submillimetre background and conclude that submillimetre galaxies reside in dark matter
halos with mass  3x1011M This minimum mass scale for sub-mm galaxies corresponds
to the most ecient dark matter mass scale for star-formation in the Universe
13 Conclusions
1 Modelling of ultraviolet to submillimetre SEDs has reached new levels of mathe-
matical and physical sophistication The use of the simplistic models of the 1960s can
not be justied At the very least the large published libraries of models calculated from
radiative transfer codes should be used
2 Interesting cosmological insights can be expected from new missions eg Herschel
and facilities eg ALMA
3 It will be important to understand cold dust and phenomena at low abundances
4 It may be hard work nding infrared galaxies at z  4 because only unusual
environments have enough dust
