Immunological selfnot-self discrimination is conventionally seen as an extracellular event 
involving interactions been receptors on T cells pre-educated to discriminate and peptides 
bound to major histocompatibility complex proteins pMHCs Mechanisms by which not-self 
peptides might first be sorted intracellularly to distinguish them from the vast excess of self-
peptides have long been called for Recent demonstrations of endogenous peptide-specific 
clustering of pMHCs on membrane rafts are indicative of intracellular enrichment before 
surface display The clustering could follow the specific aggregation of a foreign protein that 
exceeded its solubility limit in the crowded intracellular environment Predominantly 
entropy-driven this homoaggregation would co-localize identical peptides so facilitating 
their collective presentation Concentrations of self-proteins are fine-tuned over evolutionary 
time to avoid this Disparate observations such as pyrexia and female susceptibility to 
autoimmune disease can be explained in terms of the need to cosegregate cognate pMHC 
complexes internally prior to extracellular display

INTRODUCTION   
The predictions that the shaping of lymphocyte repertoires to meet future antigenic eg viral 
challenges requires both positive and negative selection1 and that for this purpose 
promiscuous tissue-restricted antigens TRAs are ectopically displayed in a central lymphoid 
organ eg thymus2 have been confirmed in many laboratories34 Reactions between the 
receptors on T cells TCRs that have been educated in this way and peptides bound by major 
histocompatibility complex proteins pMHCs on antigen presenting cells APCs appear to 
provide sufficient selfnot-self discrimination to prevent self-reactivity However recently there 
has been support for the prediction that this extracellular selfnot-self discrimination is 
supplemented by prior intracellular discrimination5 Lu et al reported in 20126 that before 
pMHC display endogenous antigen processing generates intracellular clusters of class I 
molecules segregated on the basis of their peptide cargo While confirming the high specificity 
of this colocation of cognate pMHC complexes Ferez et al in 20147 regretted that the 
mechanism of the preferential loading of newly synthesized MHC class 1 loading with viral 
peptides remained problematic  
Indeed these and many other spectacular advances bring to light as many problems as they 
solve Both centrally and peripherally the TCR specificity of T cells is set to anticipate future 
pathogens but how did this evolve Why is there less redundancy of TCR binding less cross-
reactivity than first thought Why are there coexpression groups of TRAs and why is there 
mosaic not ubiquitous TRA expression in medullary thymic epithelial cells mTECs Why do 
the self-peptides isolated from MHC proteins usually correspond to large and abundant proteins 
Is it better to think in terms of TCR affinity or avidity  
Then there are the much broader questions that are not usually dealt with in this context 
When the crunch comes is it more important to respond to foreign or prevent reaction with self 
Why are females more prone to autoimmune disease What is the adaptive value if any of 
pyrexia Can T lymphocyte reactivity with polyclonal mitogens eg lectins tell us anything 
about reactivity with specific antigens Why in infectious and autoimmune diseases are there 
changes in plasma such that erythrocytes aggregate into rouleaux that sediment rapidly in 
isolated blood samples 
The latter known clinically as the increased ESR erythrocyte sedimentation rate8 focused 
attention on macromolecular crowding and the many clinical disorders associated with specific 
extracellular or intracellular protein aggregates The present paper relates a two decade old 
hypothesis on the role of protein aggregation in intracellular selfnot-self discrimination5 to new 
developments in our understanding of pMHC presentation and thymic function While still far 
from definitive that the proposed mechanism appears to unify the many disparate problems 
listed above suggests review is timely   
THE NEAR-SELF REPERTOIRE  
A two signal hypothesis910 postulated a distinction at the level of individual immunologically-
competent cells between those specific antigenic signals that activate and those that inhibit 
Although the division is not absolute a comparable cell fate duality maps for T lymphocytes to 
two thymic locations Activation signals associated with positive repertoire selection locate 
mainly to the cortex and inhibitory signals associated with negative repertoire selection locate 
mainly to the medulla4 After endowment in a quasi-random manner with a wide range of 
specificities developing thymocytes proceed from cortex to medulla running sequentially the 
gauntlets of positive and negative selection The few that audition successfully enter the 
peripheral lymphoid system  
Ideally this somatic education process would remove self-reactivity and anticipate reactivity 
to foreign not-self antigens However given that specific foreign challenges are often from 
microorganisms with higher mutation rates than those of their hosts such anticipation would 
seem in vain Similarly the notion that over evolutionary time there is germ-line selection of 
prospective hosts with MHCs preadapted for such challenges is increasingly seen as 
unlikely1112 Thus the view that there cannot be germ-line information for anticipating the 
specific immunological challenges of future generations  ie they must start with neutral blank 
slates  has grown more secure Nevertheless the possibility that immunological repertoires 
might become skewed during somatic time to the advantage of hosts emerged when the process 
was examined from the perspective of pathogens1 
A microbe that could in one step mutate one of its antigens from a form that was not-self 
with respect to its host to a form that was self with respect to its host would have largely 
overcome the hosts immune defences with respect to that antigen It could then exploit the 
holes in the repertoire that had been created by the hosts prior elimination of self-reacting 
lymphocytes However mutation is generally a stepwise process If a microbe not-self by 
mutating a step towards self along the path from not-self to self could secure a selective 
advantage then the mutant form would come to dominate the microbe population If a microbe 
from this mutant population by mutating a further step along the path secured a further 
advantage then this new mutant form would in turn come to dominate the population Thus an 
average member of the microbe population would progressively become better adapted to the 
detriment of the host This supposes that progressive mutation along the not-self-to-self path 
would be increasingly advantageous to the microbe However the advantage would be lost if as 
it mutated closer to host-self the microbe encountered progressively stiffer host defences Thus 
positive selection of lymphocytes for specificities that were very close to but not quite anti-self 
 that is anti-near-self specificities  could be an important host adaptation1  
Indeed it is now recognized both that positive selection of T cells of intermediate affinity for 
near-self shapes immunological repertoires31316 and that the repertoires so-skewed can 
achieve selective high affinity targeting of  pathogens17 In 2013 Mandl et al18 observed TCRs 
able to bind self pMHC well but below the negative selection threshold also bind especially 
well to foreign pMHC and hence  positive selection ensures that T cells most useful for host 
defense against pathogens are selected from a diverse initial repertoire to populate the peripheral 
T cell pool Thus the raison dtre of positive selection  is to bias T cell selection towards 
strongly self-reactive clones that are endowed with a homeostatic advantage and a head start in 
anti-pathogen responses4 Cancro and Kearney19 have written similarly on the education of B 
lymphocytes whose receptors share parallel strategies of antigen recognition with T cells11 
In this way by anticipating their mutational strategies a host can albeit indirectly have prior 
knowledge of pathogens Such reasoning questions the notion that heterozygote advantage drives 
the evolution of MHC polymorphism2021 In 2004 Borghans et al22 calculated that Host-
pathogen coevolution  can easily account for realistic polymorphisms of even more than 50 
alleles per MHC locus Furthermore focusing on near-self ie limited cross-reactivity 
greatly reduces the need for TCR binding degeneracy to cope with the universe of potential 
peptide challengers2324 
The somatic education of lymphocytes is not confined to central lymphoid organs but is 
ongoing25 Indeed successful auditioners that escape from central to peripheral lymphoid 
tissues are kept tuned to near-self and maintained in a state of constant readiness through tonic 
low affinity interactions with near-self antigens that deliver survival signals but do not initiate 
proliferation in the absence of general homeostatic signals26 Thus there is a link between 
thymic pMHC experience and mature T cell homeostasis4 A lymphocyte preactivated in this 
way is poised to respond The onus is then on APCs to present appropriate high affinity pMHCs 
when circumstances so warrant 
In addition to the thymic cortexmedulla locational duality the modes of antigen presentation 
by different types of antigen-presenting cells APC in these two locations differ profoundly We 
here review how an understanding of the latter duality can relate both to two signal ideas19 and 
to the postulate of a  two-step selfnot-self discrimination processes  first an intracellular 
discrimination and then an extracellular discrimination mediated by educated T lymphocytes5 
SELF PEPTIDES AS DISTRACTORS 
Amidst a sea of near-self pMHCs for which they have intermediate affinity peripheral  TCR 
lymphocytes are kept in constant readiness for the rarer high affinity complexes that should focus 
them to the displaying cell be it a professional APC with pMHC directed to CD4 and CD8 
coreceptor T cells or another cell type with pMHC directed to CD8 T cells The need for an 
urgent response suggested by the state of constant readiness indicates advantages in APC 
mechanisms that could focus attention on newly arising high affinity pMHCs derived from not-
self peptides so avoiding distraction by the large excess of intermediate affinity pMHCs derived 
from self-peptides This made attractive hypotheses that peptides from freshly synthesized 
partial or complete proteins might somehow be selectively channeled to pMHCs Thus views 
that peptides were formed from incompletely synthesized proteins  defective ribosome 
products DRiPs or pioneer translation products PTPs  gained much attention2728 
However two recent advances make timely the recalling of an alternative mechanism5 First 
views that peptides are formed from DRiPs or PTPs are now contested by evidence that peptides 
in pMHC complexes derive from native fully synthesized properly folded proteins These 
mature proteins can be degraded to peptides at any time after synthesis and are not necessarily 
retirees that are part of normal protein turnover2931 Indeed from studies of an intracellular 
parasite that secretes only mature proteins into host cytosol Wolf and Princiotta32 conclude that 
presentation efficiency may be higher for proteins that enter the cellular pool when compared 
with those processed in a near cotranslational manner such as endogenously synthesized  
DRiPs Second there is a better understanding of how APC in the thymic cortex cortical 
thymic epithelial cells cTECs differ in peptide-generation mechanisms from various APC in 
the thymic medulla including medullary thymic epithelial cells mTECs Medullary peptide-
generation mechanisms more closely resemble those found in peripheral APCs4 Can the division 
of labour  cTECs relating to positive selection and mTECs relating to negative selection  tell 
us something about peptide sorting mechanisms and the distinction between signals that activate 
and those that inhibit We first consider how a signal that activates at one time may inhibit at 
another so the distinction must be seen in context 
ANTIGEN DOSE OPTIMUM SHIFTS  
Autoimmune diseases reflecting a failure of negative selection are usually of slowly increasing 
severity whereas attacks by microbial pathogens requiring positive selection often need urgent 
responses Assuming a duality related to antigen dosage and that dosage would be low at early 
time points it would seem more likely a priori that a low dose of an antigen would suffice for 
positive selection of responding lymphocytes whereas a high dosage would be required for their 
negative selection Building on the observations that i an effective form of immunological 
tolerance is indeed antigen dose-dependent  high doses being tolerogenic33 and ii activation 
of cultured lymphocytes by a polyclonal mitogen is an all-or-none digital phenomenon34 a 
two signal hypothesis9 proposed that low doses would provide the signal to a lymphocyte for an 
immune response positive selection and high doses would tolerize negative selection clonal 
deletion Indeed it was found that high concentrations of a polyclonal mitogen deleted cultured 
lymphocytes that deletion was complement-dependent and that it involved cross-linking of cell-
borne receptors3536 There is now evidence for both CD4 and CD8 T cells that one pMHC can 
activate and that two or more pMHCs can kill3738 However apoptosis rather than complement 
appears as the agency   
Urgency of activation relative to inhibition is supported by in vitro murine antigen dose-
response studies by Alexander-Miller et al39 At early time-points the function cytotoxic 
activity of T cells progressively increases with antigen dose However at later time-points the 
higher antigen dosages are inhibitory Thus a concentration that appears optimum at late time 
points is less than the optimum as assessed at earlier time points Similar optimum shifts are seen 
with lymphocytes cultured with varying doses of antigens or polyclonal mitogens4041 
Furthermore the late-onset high dose inhibition begins at lower dosages with high avidity 
antigens3942 Optimum shifts can also appear in vivo In 1964 Mitchison found that high dose 
tolerance was of late onset following an initial immunogenic phase33 In 1996 Liblau et al found 
that whereas thymocyte tolerance induced by high antigen dosage was rapid peripheral 
tolerance followed a period of lymphocyte activation43  
THYMIC POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SELECTION 
Following Occams razor in 1999 Barton and Rudensky44 thought it would be reasonable for 
the immune system to evaluate T cells during development on the basis of the rules of 
recognition that are required in the periphery Thus by analogy with the signaling duality in 
peripheral lymphocytes see above thymic positive selection might require low antigen dosage 
and thymic negative selection might require high antigen dosage However the thymic cortex is 
distinct from the periphery in that it is a site for generation of wide TCR diversity with apoptotic 
loss by neglect of those cells whose TCRs do not achieve a minimum level of affinity for the 
pMHCs displayed by cTECs  Only when members of such a preselection repertoire have been 
generated can they be subjected to positive selection for cells with TCRs of moderate and high 
affinity for self pMHCs In this process they may be activated to some degree45 but proliferation 
ceases46 Indeed since many cells are to be negatively selected proliferation would seem 
unnecessary at this stage 
Nevertheless the activation might follow the rules of recognition operative in the periphery 
But whereas mature peripheral lymphocytes can be activated by polyclonal activators lectins 
thymocytes cannot47 Furthermore activation of the preselection repertoire is indifferent to the 
CD4 or CD8 nature of coreceptors and only needs to be permissive or non-permissive  above a 
critical threshold below which neglect would be in play activation needs to depend neither on 
affinity for nor the actual dosage of the activating pMHC In other words there is wide affinity 
window48 Thus there would be no need for cTECs to generate large quantities of individual 
proteins in order to generate peptides44 Indeed preselection repertoire diversity might be 
maximized if the resources for protein production were devoted to producing many proteins 
rather than large quantities of individual proteins In this circumstance as suggested by Linsk et 
al in 19892 a low level of whole genome transcriptional noise  otherwise illegitimate 
ectopic or leaky transcription  might suffice to produce sufficient quantities of each protein 
for positive selection49 
On the other hand thymic negative selection requires high concentrations of individual 
proteins A well-studied example is proinsulin where a polymorphic variant associated with high 
thymic expression spares humans from type 1 diabetes50 Likewise for rodents Kyewski and 
Klein51 note the  exquisite sensitivity of the central tolerance process to moderate quantitative 
variations in TRA expression Thus subtle differences in the range of two- to fourfold in 
intrathymic expression of auto-antigens as obtained in mice with defined copy numbers of 
pancreatic or nervous system-specific antigens can modulate the susceptibility to autoimmunity  
A need for high concentrations implies that each mTEC would limit the diversification of its 
proteins so that its resources for protein production could better produce large quantities of a 
few proteins from which corresponding pMHCs would be produced2 This would be consistent 
with a dramatic difference between cTECs and mTECS  namely the mosaic location within 
distinctive medullary sectors of the specific pMHC-bearing mTECs that promiscuously 
synthesize different TRAs It is estimated that at given time only 13 of mTECs produce a 
particular antigen52 While currently there is much concern about differences between cTECS 
and mTECs in the qualitative characteristics of the peptides produced  cTECs generate a unique 
MHC ligandome4  this could be merely ancillary to the need to optimize these two different 
roles  
Nevertheless one qualitative characteristic of a mature protein from which peptides are 
derived is important  its function Once synthesized within the thymus a promiscuous gene 
product is not needed for its function but for its components A need for high quantities raises 
the prospect of a degree of ectopic function that could endanger the cell For this reason it would 
be predicted first that there would be an intracellular mechanism to limit function eg rapid 
inactivation and dismemberment following synthesis see below and second that mTECs 
would have a shorter lifespan than cTECs53 so there would be no medullary equivalent of 
cortical nurse cells4  
A similarity between medullary and peripheral mechanisms of negative selection would seem 
necessary to avoid central negative selection generating unduly large holes in the final 
repertoire23 If the probability of a particular self-peptide ever being presented peripherally were 
remote then a medullary state under which that pMHC might invoke negative selection would 
be superfluous54 Indeed Kyewski and Haskins55 note that cTECs represent a unique APC type 
in the body   In contrast the two major medullary APC types DCs and mTECs very much 
resemble peripheral APCs Thus it would seem appropriate to look to peripheral APCs for 
guidance on mechanisms that might exist in mTECs 
However when contrasting medullary negative selection of developing thymocytes with the 
negative selection of mature peripheral lymphocytes another difference emerges Despite 
possible shifts in optimum dosage see above a peripheral lymphocyte interacting with pMHC 
can be deemed as held within a narrow time-window within which there must be a decision 
between positive activation and negative selection On the other hand for cells of the post-
positive selection thymocyte repertoire that enter the medulla there is only one failpass decision 
to be made  either be negatively selected or not This would seem to require some pMHC dose 
on mTECs but not necessarily a high pMHC dose We are then returned to the MHC 
ligandome dilemma referred to above which would seem better resolved by ascribing 
differences in cortical and medullar selections to qualitative differences in peptides4 However 
this problem can be addressed if we ascribe the need for high antigen dosage to a critical 
intracellular event that surface pMHC dosage comes to reflect 
INTRACELLULAR SELFNOT-SELF DISCRIMINATION   
Given that peripheral APCs can present both self pMHC and non-self pMHCs it is easy to 
suppose that the key to selfnot-self discrimination is the central educational process that 
creates a T lymphocyte repertoire that does not respond immunologically to self but does 
respond to not-self However a mechanism for over-riding distracting self pMHCs in favour of a 
rare non-self pMHC would seem advantageous2056  Thus the processing of self pMHCs 
responsible for the tonic stimulation of T-cells in the periphery should somehow differ either 
absolutely or in degree from the processing of pMHCs derived from proteins deemed not-self  
There is now evidence that prior to appearance at the APC surface there is intracellular 
clustering of pMHC complexes with the same peptide cargo ie cognate pMHC complexes 
cosegregate internally Lu et al6 regard this as our most important finding and Ferez et al 7 
find as the more important implication that the peptide-specific clustering is indicative of 
intracellular enrichment Noting that the exact mechanism causing the cognate pMHC 
enrichment remains unclear Ferez et al suggest that it may result from the burst of viral 
protein expression that peaks a few hours post-infection This burst could lead to a preferential 
loading of newly synthesized MHC class I complexes with viral peptides In other words a 
virus that expresses its proteins in a burst automatically identifies itself to the host as not-self 
However the proposed enrichment of identical peptides raises the possibility of a special 
mechanism for their intracellular colocation to separate them from other more diffusely 
distributed peptides ie the possibility of a specific intracellular discriminatory process that is 
not so easily subverted This colocation mechanism could act at the level of diffusely distributed 
individual pMHC complexes or could occur earlier There is only one copy of a particular 
peptide within a protein which often displays only that one peptide So the colocation could first 
occur at the level of the individual peptides once they had each been released from diffusely 
distributed donor protein molecules Alternatively the colocation could first occur at the level of 
the donor proteins so that the released peptides would then be available in close proximity for 
formation of cognate pMHC clusters A mechanism consistent with the latter alternative5 is 
discussed below  
If there were an intracellular selfnot-self discrimination process it could have first evolved at 
a primitive unicellular level where it would have served to rapidly limit the function of 
components of an intracellular pathogen andor to trigger host apoptosis The latter would 
altruistically militate against spread of the pathogen to neighbouring members of the species that 
shared host genes57 Even supposing that the hand of evolution had conjured up such a 
mechanism it alone would not have sufficed in multicellular organisms where something 
equivalent to a pMHC display would have served to inform an entire organism that one of it cells 
contained something designated as not-self The primitive T cells that recognized that cell 
would not only kill the cell but would be stimulated to divide so producing more T cells of the 
same specificity which could then both seek other cells that displayed the same foreign pMHC 
and establish immunological memory Thus immediate apoptosis triggered by an intracellular 
selfnot-self discrimination event would seem counter-productive 
INTRACELLULAR AGGREGATION HYPOTHESIS 
Building on studies of the specificity of the aggregation of erythrocytes into rouleaux by proteins 
and other agents that do not directly interact with the erythrocytes858 the problem of 
intracellular selfnot-self discrimination in the crowded intracellular environment was 
addressed in the decade after the discovery of the association of peptides with MHC 
proteins205960 Cytosolic proteins are deemed to exert a collective pressure tending to make 
individual protein species coaggregate self-assemble when their concentrations exceed their 
individual solubility limits These concentrations have been fine-tuned to the concentrations of 
their evolutionary fellow travellers so as not to exceed these limits Not-self proteins more 
readily trip this intracellular surveillance system because their concentrations have not been so 
fine-tuned5 When a virus infects a cell at best this process results in pMHC display and the 
destruction of the cell at least the virus is forced to mutate in order to avoid identification as 
not-self and the mutated form may proliferate less well6162  
When macromolecules in solution reach a critical concentration it becomes energetically more 
favourable for them to aggregate like-with-like than to remain in simple solution The 
aggregation involves liberation of bound water and an increase in entropy Being primarily 
entropy driven the aggregation is promoted by an increase in temperature63 That the crowded 
cytosol constitutes an environment which readily drives proteins out of solution when they 
exceed individual concentration thresholds is well recognized from the difficulties encountered 
when trying to over-express proteins within foreign cytosols using expression vectors Lowering 
culture temperature is a common strategy to overcome this Likewise increasing an organisms 
temperature pyrexia can be seen as a short-term strategy for increasing the probability of 
aggregation when the adaptive value of recognizing foreign may be greater than that of avoiding 
self-reactivity Furthermore an organism retains the option of declaring one of its own self 
proteins foreign should its sequence or expression change due to mutation  
The exquisite like-with-like specificity that intracellular aggregation can achieve is now well 
documented64 Such homoaggregation often results in loss of function But the scale of the 
aggregation in APC envisaged here microaggregation suggests experimental detection would 
not be easy However macroscopic aggregates inclusion bodies are a feature of various 
clinical conditions eg Parkinsons disease Although prior homoaggregation occurs 
independently of the formation of inclusion bodies which can contain various proteins their 
presence provides a measure of the predisposing aggregation process If factors promoting or 
impeding the formation of such macro-aggregates similarly affect pMHC displays in infected 
cells this can be construed as indirectly supporting the view that micro-aggregation is a 
necessary stepping stone leading to those displays Rather than repeat previous arguments for the 
aggregation hypothesis521 the present paper draws attention to recent work supporting the 
stepping stone viewpoint that aggregation first marks a protein as not-self and this is an 
essential prerequisite for the display of one or more of its peptides as pMHCs  
NEW EVIDENCE ON AGGREGATION 
Predicting tight control of intracellular protein concentrations the aggregation hypothesis 
focused on the evolution of sex chromosome dosage compensation60 Evidence for a 
chromosomal rather than hormonal basis for sex differences in the incidence of autoimmune 
diseases65 now supports the view that failure of human females to adequately turn-off one X 
chromosome so increasing aggregation pressure could explain their marked predisposition to 
autoimmune diseases66
  Consistent with this males with chromosomal anomalies such that there 
are two X chromosomes are also predisposed67 
Since one of the roles of heat shock proteins HSPs is to chaperone intracellular proteins and 
reverse their aggregation the existence of a class of inducible HSPs that would promote 
aggregation was postulated68 Their induction would associate with the pyrexia accompanying an 
antigenic challenge and their experimental or therapeutic elimination would decrease 
aggregation and hence could be of value when studying or treating autoimmune diseases 
Vitiligo patches of white skin is a positive prognostic factor in patients with melanoma 
tumours indicating immune attack directed both against tumor antigens and those of pigmented 
skin cells This T cell-mediated collateral damage of skin cells is decreased when inducible 
HSP70 is inactivated and increased when it is overexpressed69 Consistent with this overturning 
long-held contrary views formation of the intracellular aggregates in Huntingtons disease is 
now reported to be favoured by the heat-shock response that should associate with pyrexia70  
Another prediction of the aggregation hypothesis was that proteins should be under 
evolutionary constraint not only to retain specific function but also to retain solubility and 
lifespan required for their collective function  the exerting of aggregation pressure Thus 
organisms synthesizing proteins with mutations adversely affecting the latter properties would 
be selected against71 Molecular properties such as isoelectric point and size which affect ability 
to aggregate would be expected to vary less than predicted on the basis of known amino acid 
substitution rates This was observed as low inter-species variation in two dimensional gel 
electrophoretic analyses of proteins72 and is consistent with work showing that variance in 
mRNA concentrations is much greater than the variance in concentrations of the corresponding 
proteins73 And from bioinformatic analyses in 2012 Hoof et al74 concluded that protein 
abundance carries more information for the prediction of protein sampling for MHC 
presentation as peptides than transcript levels do  
The hypothesis that protein concentrations have evolved to contribute and to respond to the 
aggregation pressure exerted collectively by intracellular proteins predicts that excess of one 
protein will cause differential aggregation of others thus exerting pleiotropic effects eg changes 
in functions not necessarily related to that of the original protein75 Furthermore aggregation of 
intact proteins is favoured when they are large andor abundant the latter being likely to 
correlate with gene expression level in terms of mRNA concentrations In a survey of pMHCs 
Fortier et al76 found that most peptides are derived from abundant mRNAs And peptides are 
disproportionately presented from large proteins7477  
Another prediction is that proteins contributing most to macromolecular crowding will be 
conserved by virtue of this property This means that highly expressed proteins are likely to be 
more conserved evolve slower than lowly expressed proteins The conservation affects both 
protein surface residues so that reactivity with the surfaces of other proteins is decreased 
misinteraction avoidance and protein cores misfolding avoidance This highly significant 
negative correlation between the expression level of a protein and its rate of evolution the E-R 
anticorrelation has been most studied in bacteria and yeast but there is suggestive evidence for 
its generality7879 There is also a highly significant negative correlation between expression level 
and the finely tuned propensity to aggregate80 
If differential aggregation is the mechanism by which intracellular selfnot-self discrimination 
initiates it would be predicted that the generation of aggregrates would precede any covalent 
modifications that might lead to peptide generation by way of the proteasome-ubiquitin system 
or other channels Although there is no direct evidence on this recent studies in pathological 
aggregation systems indicate that ubiquitination or phosphorylation occur after aggregation8182 
This suggests a necessity for prior aggregation in order that these downstream events can occur 
Regarding non-allelic genes by limiting the range of proteins ectopically expressed at any 
one time an mTEC decreases the chance of the co-aggregation of two proteins that would 
normally not be in the same tissue environment together This would be part of the strategy of 
minimizing the number and size of potential holes in the T cell repertoire83 Indeed there is 
evidence that discrete sub-sets of genes coexpression groups with distinctive chromosomal 
locations are expressed at different time-points4 These may have been selected over 
evolutionary time because they do not coaggregate Whereas most autosomal genes are 
biallelically expressed some autosomal genes like female X chromosomal genes are 
monoallelically expressed in a random manner Biallelic or monoallelic expression as random 
alternatives in mTECs84 might facilitate thymocyte selection or deletion in heterozygotes if 
aggregation were impeded or advanced by the heterozygosity  
THE AVIDITY INTERPRETATION 
Evidence for this proposed designation of a protein as not-self by specific intracellular 
aggregation is currently indirect But assuming it to occur there should then be a corresponding 
pMHC display The number of pMHCs displayed should be reflective of the intracellular 
concentration of the peptide-donor protein within a peripheral APC Given that there is a 
sufficient concentration in the first place to permit the aggregation what is it about the 
subsequent display that reflects an intermediate concentration of a protein corresponding to a 
high affinity pMHC hence requiring an immune response And what is it about the display that 
reflects a high concentration of a protein corresponding to a high affinity pMHC hence requiring 
a tolerogenic response  
Following the minimal two signal postulate9 one pMHC should be stimulatory and multiple 
pMHCs would be inhibitory8586 This model is among those classified in 2013 by Bains et al87 
as p  sum where T cells continually re-assess fate decisions on the basis of multiple 
summed proximal signals from TCR-pMHC interactions An additional postulate was that the 
inhibition would require that the signaling receptors be in close proximity9 Thus a model for the 
shaping of lymphocyte repertoires by both positive and negative selection employed the term 
avidity rather than affinity1 It was held that there must be close receptor-determinant 
interaction for a discrete period of time  a function that relates to the chemical affinity of the 
receptor for the determinant Furthermore the stimulation of the cell to initiate an immune 
response follows reaction of antigenic determinants with a limited number of cell-borne 
receptors but at high determinant concentrations  there is increased probability of the 
simultaneous occurrence of two reactions in close proximity at the lymphocyte surface between 
cell-borne receptors and antigenic determinants Indeed for thymocytes Suzuki et al88 
proposed that low degrees of cross-linking were required for positive selection and more 
extensive cross-linking was inhibitory In 1997 Girao et al noted89  
The critical parameter determining the developmental fate of thymocytes is the avidity of 
interaction between thymocyte TCR and peptideMHC complexes of thymic stromal cells 
low avidity interaction results in no selection and the death of thymocyte by programmed 
death intermediate avidity results in the rescue of thymocytes from programmed death and 
positive selection and high avidity results in negative selection One of the original caveats 
of this model is that there may be upper and lower limits to the intrinsic affinity of a peptide 
that may prevent it from triggering the positive or negative selection of a thymocyte 
irrespective of the density on thymic stromal cells For example a peptide may have such 
high affinity for thymocyte TCR that even at very low density on thymic stromal cells the 
avidity of interaction is too high for positive selection and only induces negative selection 
conversely a peptide may have such a low affinity for thymocyte TCR that even at 
maximum density on thymic stromal cells it is incapable of generating sufficient avidity for 
positive or negative selection  
Their experiments lead them to conclude that the overall avidity and not solely the affinity of 
TCR-peptideMHC interaction determines the developmental fate of thymocytes 
But in a later consideration of hypotheses to resolve the selection paradox Klein et al90 
distinguished models based on the avidity or the affinity of the TCRpeptideMHC 
interaction with the severe caveat Although the two models are frequently used 
synonymously they are based on distinct assumptions The avidity model predicts that the 
quantity of a given peptideMHC complex expressed by cTECs dictates whether a thymocyte 
expressing an interacting TCR will be positively selected or deleted whereas the affinity model 
instead postulates a crucial role of the quality of the individual TCRpeptideMHC interaction 
However recent progress in the field seems to have led the authors to refer to affinity andor 
avidity and to write simply of strong interactions and weak interactions4  
Indeed there is now considerable evidence for cognate pMHC coexpression in membrane 
nanoclusters that crosslink TCRs during interaction between APC and a T cell9192 This tends to 
be interpreted as a means of achieving more efficient early T cell activation Ferez et al note7 
The detection of clusters of MHC molecules presenting identical viral peptides upon virus 
infection provides a solution to the paradox between the long-known need for multivalency 
of experimental activating TCR ligands  and the notion that there is only a very small 
probability that a few identical pMHC complexes within a sea of irrelevant pMHC 
complexes will ever get close enough to engage the TCR in a multivalent fashion Second 
they support a model where the interaction between the TCR and its pMHC ligands is 
multivalent providing a mechanism whereby cooperation between low-affinity interactions 
leads to an increased apparent affinity and thus high sensitivity 
Nevertheless possible late-onset inhibitory effects reflecting shifting dose-response 
relationships see above were not excluded Since the degree of cross-linking would be less 
important in the cortex cTECs would require much lower pMHC levels than mTECs as is 
observed13 It would also be predicted that formation of membrane nanoclusters would be less 
necessary in cTECs Consistent with this the expression of a marker for membrane lipid rafts 
was not maximal until a late stage of positive thymic selection93 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
Of four consecutive hypotheses  two signal9 positive selection1 protein-based intracellular 
selfnot-self discrimination5 and antibody RNA-based intracellular selfnot-self 
discrimination94  the first two albeit in various guises are now widely accepted Indeed 
noting that somewhat paradoxically recognition of self can elicit diametrically opposed 
outcomes Klein et al4 declare The classical affinity model of thymocyte selection offers an 
attractive conceptual framework to resolve this apparent contradiction However they regret 
that it does not take into account the fact that positive selection and negative selection mainly 
occur in discrete thymic microenvironments  the cortex and the medulla The present paper 
has addressed this duality in terms of a differential protein aggregation mechanism for selfnot-
self discrimination that draws parallels with the aggregation phenomena found in various 
diseases and is informed by studies of lectin-lymphocyte interaction The paper has considered 
neither the nature of third signals that entice some CD4 T cells to adopt other roles nor the 
roles of non- T cells nor the putative antibody role of RNA57618395 Nevertheless it is hoped 
that the proposed explanations for numerous disparate phenomena will fruitfully guide future 
experimentation
