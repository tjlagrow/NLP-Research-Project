Abstract
An objectoriented approach to create a natural language understanding
system is considered The understanding program is a formal system built
on the base of predicative calculus Horns clauses are used as wellformed
formulas An inference is based on the principle of resolution Sentences of
natural language are represented in the view of typical predicate set These
predicates describe physical objects and processes abstract objects cate-
gories and semantic relations between objects Predicates for concrete asser-
tions are saved in a database To describe the semantics of classes for phys-
ical objects abstract concepts and processes a knowledge base is applied
The proposed representation of natural language sentences is a semantic net
Nodes of such net are typical predicates This approach is perspective as
rstly such typication of nodes facilitates essentially forming of processing
algorithms and object descriptions secondly the eectiveness of algorithms
is increased  particularly for the great number of nodes thirdly to describe
the semantics of words encyclopedic knowledge is used and this permits
essentially to extend the class of solved problems

 how to realize the computer understanding
 how to check the accuracy of computer understanding
An understanding of complete text is a thorough insight into the sense of
assertions which are included in this text As regards the computer under-
standing it is realized with algorithms to represent the semantics of sentences
and to check such representation
Consider at rst what the assertion the sense of sentence is  means 
It should be distinguished the sense for an author of information
from the sense for a reader of this information as this depends on the volume
of knowledge Ontological and epistemological representations are as well of
great importance1
2 The sense of sentence is contained rstly in the meaning of words
secondly in the functional role of these words in the sentence thirdly in
properties of objects which are known from previous sentences 2
3 For abstract concepts and classes of physical objects the sense of
words is concluded in the standard understanding in explanatory dictionar-
ies For individual objects the sense consists in properties of these objects
Some words have not the standard meaning good beauty love then it
should be took into account an emotional relation of author to their using
4 When we speak about the functional role of words in a sentence we
imply such categories as a subject objects of inuence an action or internal
change of subject other facts of the case place time cause purpose tool
and method of action It should be diered an object and its properties
5 A sentence can not be considered separately but only in the con-
junction with other sentences and knowledge of object domain The sense of
sentences has as well an implicit character which is contained in actions and
events following from actual information of sentences
1For example consider the sentence Napoleon lost the battle of Waterloo The name
Napoleon can consider as the name of historical person or the name of horse At last it
can assume the migration of souls Such distinction in semantic representation for the
name Napoleon implies the distinction in the sense of sentence
2 For instance a sentence describes actions of Peter It is known from previous sentences
that Peter is unmarried This can explain his further actions
By this means the sense of sentences have objective and subjective as-
pects It can point to three aspects 3
 cognitive propositional - the description of facts as well as general
assertions following from facts
 communicative - the organization of text so that the accent is done on
certain factors of content
 pragmatical illocutive - the explanation of sentence pronouncing as
the action that is executed with certain purpose
We limit ourselves only to cognitive propositional aspect It is necessary
to extract an objective component in the sense of declarative sentences This
component presents the general content for a software engineer and an expert
which checks the accuracy of understanding program work To extract this
objective component we assume that rstly both are based on certain on-
tology and epistemology secondly meanings of words are understood equally
according to an explanatory dictionary thirdly both follow standard rules
of grammar for English see for example 21
To answer the question How to realize the computer understanding we
must as noted above be based on certain ontology and epistemology As
such basis we use modern empiricism 23 Empiricism is founded on modern
physical science concerning the structure of world and explains the reliability
of scientic conclusions We take the main thesis of empiricism all synthetic
knowledge is based on experience
The world consists of physical objects which correspond to certain do-
mains of physical place in a given point of time Physical objects can act or
change their state These actions of objects and processes of internal state
change events are named facts By this means the real world consists of
facts As BRussell points physical facts for most part are independent not
only of our volitions but even of our existence 23 part 2 ch11 We de-
scribe both real or possible facts and general assertions with the help of
declarative sentences The truth of concrete sentences for real actions and
events consists in the conformity with available facts For our approach the
sentence of natural language is presented with a set of predicates describing
actions events states processes persons organizations things machines
and other classes of essences and connections
To answer the question How to check the accuracy of computer under-
standing it should be took into account the above determination of sense
To establish the conformity of sentence sense and its semantic representation
it will be sucient to use simple and logical questions Simple questions
permit to check the availability of all categories subject objects etc in
representations of facts Logical questions examine the ability of computer
system to do inferences on the basis of present facts and knowledge
2 Levels of computer understanding
Preparatory proceeding to the computer understanding it should be spec-
ied basic principles of computer work
1A computer has a timepiece This denotes that the computer measures
a physical time
2 A computer permits to save numbers and symbols Another way the
computer has a memory Online storage consists of cells Each cell can save
a symbol and has a certain address Online storage is shortterm memory
Longterm memory is realized using peripheral
3 A computer maps points on a display Consequently the computer
forms points of discrete space with two coordinates
4 A computer executes arithmetic Then it can say that the computer
understands what arithmetic mean
5 A computer moves a symbol from one address to other This permits
to form abstract words as sequences of symbols
6 A computer executes a program which consists of a sequence of
commands Each command contains the code of operation and addresses
Commands execute arithmetic transfer of symbols and conditional transfer
Conditional transfer changes the sequence of command execution
7 A computer can see hear by means of peripheral This means
that the computer has perceptions
8 A computer robot can go in physical space and implement various
physical actions using special mechanisms
9 As an operation system realizes dierent actions controls programs
remembers all actions and events it can speak about computer consciousness
The construction of computer permitted ATuring to express the hypoth-
esis about the ability of computer to answer questions so that an answer
of a person and the computer can not be distinguished Another way the
computer can understand questions and adequately answer
It can distinguish four levels of computer understanding
At the rst level we take into account only such grammatical categories
as subject objects place and time action event as well as other adverbial
modiers in a sentence This approach is realized with syntax analysis For
this level a computer system can answer simple questions Such approach is
of frequent use to translate from one language to other by means of computer
At the second level paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words
are established Sentences are presented with semantic net where nodes have
a simple structure Investigations in 1 4 6 9 22 24 25 26 27 relate to this
level At the second level an understanding program can answer many ques-
tions using an inference The understanding of semantics for actions events
and physical objects is not sucient and is contained usually in inference
At the third level sentences are represented with a set of predicates the
objectoriented approach11 12 13 Properties and changes of physical
and abstract object are described with typical predicates3 Physical physi-
ological and psychological characteristics are estimated using special scales
If measuring is executed with a physical device then the semantics of prop-
erty is described by physical regularities For psychological characteristics
it is necessary to use algorithms of recognition To determine economical
activities special algorithms are demanded
At third level there is the certain advance to describe actions and pro-
cesses In the work 24 the classication of action was proposed We use it
in the modied view
PROCESS  long purposeful occupation job sport studies
PROPEL  applying a force to an object
MOVE  movement of body part
INGEST  ingesting something inside
EXPEL  expelling something from a subject
GRASP  grasping an object
3Our approach is ontological Based on functions properties and structure of real
objects we advert to the description of words If we shall form a special structure frame
for every word then we shall be at a deadlock as the variety of words is enormous To
solve this problem we use encyclopedic knowledge
GO  displacement of subject
TRANSFER  change of general relation for a subject to buy to sell to
come into fortune
ATTEND  perceptions of subject to see to hear to touch
MESSAGE  transmission of information between a subject and object
BE  identity of subject and object existence of subject or connection be-
tween a subject and certain class of objects
CHANGE  transition of subject to another internal state event
CREATE  thinking decision-making problem-solving prediction
HAVE  possession of object
Clearly this classication is not sucient as it does not take account of
semantics for many verbs To describe the semantics of simple movements
of hand and leg it can use cinematic equations The complex action for
example to lead an orchestra to play tennis to send a message is a sequence
of simple movements and described with verbal denition and operation see
further TWinograd was a pioneer in this direction In the work 30 virtual
movements of robot are realized by certain programs
To represent concrete and general sentences for a given object domain
we apply a semantic net Nodes of such net are typical predicates This
approach is perspective  particularly for the great number of nodes Firstly
such typication of nodes simplies greatly forming of processing algorithms
and object descriptions secondly the eectiveness of algorithms is increased
thirdly we apply encyclopedic knowledge to describe the semantics of words
and this extends essentially the class of solved problems
At the fourth level the objectoriented approach is connected with func-
tions of perception and physical movement To do this it is necessary to
create a robot which has organs of sense executes physical measurements
as well as realizes physical movements The availability of recognition algo-
rithms permits to teach such robot the cognizance of physical objects and
determination of their properties Then it can use visual determinations to
teach basic words 23 part II-ch2 Other words are determined verbally
Besides such robot can implement certain physical actions This speaks
about more deep understanding of these actions
Searles point is that the mere carrying out of a successful algorithm does
not in itself imply that any understanding has taken place 16 ch1 How-
ever at the fourth level a robot and a person overcome the same path to the
understanding of that how to represent physical objects and actions events
associated with words using the realization of physical actions and recogni-
tion algorithms of objects Besides the robot recognizes words of certain
language and discovers their grammatical role in a sentence takes account
of sense relations between words checks the accuracy of word combinations
Consequently at the fourth level there is much common in computer and
human understanding although physical principles of work are dierent No
all actions of robot can be described formally that is it can not be spoken
that the robot works only according to strict algorithms
Thus the fourth level permits essentially to approximate to the human
understanding However there are open problems connected with the un-
derstanding of such abstract concepts as good beauty love truth etc At
the moment it is not clear how to do this Some questions can be solved
now For example the program of understanding can be taught to create
new classes using algorithms of classication We can form new properties
by means of analogous algorithms Induction and analogy can be used to
solve creative tasks 17
3 Typical predicates to represent sentences
To represent concrete and general sentences it is necessary to use the
next predicates for
 physical objects persons things machines animals natural phenom-
 actions and processes connected with physical objects
 events and states for physical objects
 categories connected with objects actions and processes time place
property
 abstract objects
 sense relations between actions processes objects events and states
Physical objects are described with predicates of type u1 u2  un
where u1 u2  un are variables providing in the aggregate the identica-
tion of object For example it is necessary to use as such variables for
persons rst and second name sex age place of birth etc A concrete
object is presented by means of substitution of individual constants instead
variables Each real object is characterized by a compact connected domain
of physical space at a given point of time Points of this domain have coordi-
nates x1 x2 x3 as well as physical parameters mass charge temperature
etc2 AppA The predicate  is true during a certain interval of time if a
real object exists in this interval
Categories connected with objects actions and processes are presented
with predicates of type y1 y2  yn where y1 y2  yn are variables pro-
viding in the aggregate the identication of given category As categories
we consider a time place and property of object Concrete category is
formed by means of substitution of individual constants instead variables
Every real time is characterized by an interval of physical time the place
corresponds to a domain of physical space with coordinates x1 x2 x3 The
property of physical object is a characteristic conditioned by the physical
and psychological regularities
Sense relations between objects are described with predicates of type
q1 q2  qn where q1 q2  qn are variables Abstract objects correspond
to predicates of type r1 r2  rn where r1 r2  rn are variables A con-
crete sense relation abstract object is formed using the substitution of in-
dividual constants instead variables
Actions processes connected with physical objects are presented with
predicates of type v1 v2  vn where v1 v2  vn are variables providing
in the aggregate the identication of given action or process As such vari-
ables we use a subject objects of inuence time and place of action as well
as other facts of the case As these factors correspond to other predicates to
point to them we use unique codes appointed these predicates A concrete
action process is described using the substitution of individual constants
instead variables A real action process is characterized by a set of compact
connected domains in a physical spacetime4 Each such domain consists of
points with coordinates x1 x2 x3 t and physical parameters The predicate
 is true in a certain interval of time if a set of domains corresponds to a real
ie checked fact A place of action process embraces domains of subject
objects of inuence in physical space with coordinates x1 x2 x3 during a
given interval of time
4Hereafter we are dealing with classical Galilean spacetime16 ch5 For the object
domain connected with social system it is sucient
Events states connected with physical objects are presented with predi-
cates of type w1 w2  wn where w1 w2  wn are variables providing in
the aggregate the identication of this event and state As such variables
we use codes of subject objects of inuence time and place etc A concrete
event state is described using the substitution of individual constants in-
stead variables Each real event state is characterized by a set of compact
connected domains in a physical spacetime Each domain contains points
with coordinates x1 x2 x3 t and physical parameters The predicate  is
true in a certain interval of time if a set of domains corresponds to a real fact
A place of event state embraces domains of subject objects of inuence in
physical space with coordinates x1 x2 x3 during a given interval of time
Go on now to the detailed description of above types of predicates Only
after that we can consider the formal representation for concrete and general
sentences Values of variables as a rule correspond to names of variables
otherwise these values are explained If we speak about the type of some-
thing this means that values of variables are divided into several classes As
an illustration we can point to some names of classes Codes of objects
action events and states included in descriptions of predicates pose refer-
ences to these objects actions events and states These references present
semantic relations between objects actions events and states

4 A database
A database contains a set of typical predicates describing facts after
the substitution of individual constants instead variables The database in-
cludes such predicates person organization thing machine animal abstr
nature action process event message thought property number place
time cause relation link Besides the database contains dictionaries of
paradigms verbs and nouns5
41 A dictionary of paradigms
To represent a dictionary of paradigms we use the predicate
paradigm cod par osn form paradigm gram cat synt char
where cod par is a code of paradigm osn form is a basic form of word
gram cat is a grammatical category synt char is a syntax characteristic
A basic form is a basic word in dictionaries It can be several descriptions
with the same basic form to present all paradigms for all parts of speech A
grammatical category points to belonging to a certain part of speech noun
5Described further project solutions are oriented to English For other languages these
solutions must be modied
verb adverb etc A syntax characteristic describes a syntax function of
given word in a sentence For example an adverb can be the next sorts
place time degree manner
42 A dictionary of nouns
To represent a dictionary of nouns6 we use the predicate
noun cod int osn form gram cat maj class sem cod verb scale state
combin 
where cod int is an unique code osn form is a basic form of word gram cat
is a grammatical category noun or adjective maj class is a generic class
sem cod is a semantic code verb is a corresponding verb for verbal noun
scale denotes a scale see above state is a state pointed by a value of scale
combin describes the compatibility of nouns
The variable sem cod has the next values person prof profession sibl
sibling connection org organization animanimal plant place time
thing weapon  mach machine occup occupation event state prop prop-
erty body  natur natural phenomenon mat matter env environment
psych psychic process or action mes message act physical action of
person abstr
attribute of
quantity
abstract concept scale cloth food quant
The description of compatibility for nouns connected by means of preposi-
tions permits to point to admissible combinations of preposition and semantic
code for example for the word book on thing on abstr of person of org
43 A dictionary of verbs
The predicate of this dictionary is of the form
verb cod verb inf after verb sem typ scale beg state end state subj contr at
contr from contr to contr with
where cod verb is a code of verb inf is a basic form Innitive after verb is
an adverbial particle sem typ is a semantic type of verb PROPEL MOVE
GO etc beg state is a start state pointed by a value of scale as a result
of action end state is a nal state subj is semantic codes of subject see the
6Besides nouns this dictionary contains as well adjectives
description of the predicate noun contr at is the description of control in the
construction AT contr to is the description of control in the construction TO
contr from is the description of control in the construction FROM contr with
is the description of control in the construction WITH
The description of control in the construction AT is used to point to
semantic codes of noun realizing a direct object see the description of the
predicate noun The control in the construction FROM characterizes an in-
direct object from which an action is transferred To do this it is necessary
to point to admissible combinations of preposition and semantic code for
example for the verb get from person from org The control in the con-
struction TO presents an indirect object to which an action is directed To
do this it is necessary as well to point to admissible combinations of prepo-
sition and semantic code for example for the verb put on mach on body
to thing The control in the construction WITH describes possible tools and
methods to realize the given action
For example for the verb shoot in the meaning kill
sem type
beg state
end state
contr at
contr with
Depending on the sense a verb can have several descriptions in the dic-
tionary verb
The dictionary maps the admissible compatibility of subject and objects
with the character of action 7 This permits to eliminate the semantic ambi-
guity for verbsnouns and to determine nonsensical sentences see further
7The analogous approach was proposed in 9 using the concept of semantic valence
The dependence of subject and objects on the type of verb is considered as well in works
of Katz-Fodor 8
5 Semantic representations of sentences using typical predicates
To represent every sentence one must execute semantic descriptions
 groups of nouns
 simple sentences
 compound and complex sentences
The semantic representation is based on syntax analysis of sentence The
description of grammar is executed by means of Backus-Naur form11 
51 Semantic representations of noun groups
Subjects objects adverbial modiers are described using a group of noun
Consider a simple group of noun including a basic noun and attributes At
the beginning of group a preposition can be If the basic noun describes a
physical or abstract object then this noun is transformed to the predicate
of type person animal organization thing machine nature abstr To
determine the type of predicate the semantic code of this noun pointed in
the dictionary of nouns is used A verbal noun is considered in association
with an action or event described in a given sentencesee further
If the basic noun poses a time or place it is necessary to take account of
a preposition In this case the noun is transformed to the predicate of type
time place
By means of article the individualizing character of basic noun is de-
termined
If the attribute of basic noun is a property then the predicate
property is formed for this attribute If the attribute is a participle then the
predicate of action or event is built If nouns are used as attribute then it
can consider such group as an extended group of noun see further
When the group of noun is analysed the identication of objects is exe-
cuted The identication permits to establish the identity of objects Algo-
rithms of identication are considered in 12 If an identical object already
exists for the given basic noun then the new predicate is not formed and
only the available predicate is modied
To analyse an extended group of noun connecting simple groups of nouns
using prepositions rules of compatibility for nouns are used see the dictio-
nary of nouns If a noun denoting a property is connected with other noun
using the preposition of then the predicate property is formed for the rst
and pointed to this property in the second
If the preposition of is used
to present an owner of thing or machine then this owner is pointed in the
predicate thing or machine In other cases rules of compatibility are used
The connection between simple groups of nouns is realized with the predicate
relation
52 Semantic representations of simple sentences
An analysed text is divided into fragments Each fragment is character-
ized by unity of place and time All actions or events of fragment are executed
during a certain interval of time The place and time are described usually in
the rst sentences According to the principle of coherence 8 sec9-2 these
place and time as a rule are not pointed in following sentences Then to
form the semantic representation for these sentences the earlierdescribed
place and time are used Personal demonstrative and possessive pronouns
pose references to earlierdescribed actions processes events states and ob-
jects Indenite pronouns point to the existential quantier some any and
the universal quantier all every each 23 part IIch10
Consider the semantic representation of simple declarative sentence Af-
ter the semantics of a subject objects place time other adverbial modiers
is described to represent the semantics of sentence it is necessary to form
the semantic description of actions processes events states To do this
the analysis of predicate in grammatical sense is executed The following
predicates are formed as a result of semantic analysis action  for physi-
cal actions message  for the transmission of information thought  for
feelings and thoughts process  for long goalseeking occupations event 
for events and states The choice of predicate is based on the indication of
semantic type in the dictionary of verbs
Forming of semantic predicates describing actions and events is reduced
to the determination of factors which are typical for these actions and events
 subject of action event
 objects which take part in the transmission of information or action
 location and time of action event
 purpose result and method tool of action event
Semantic roles of indirect objects and adverbial modiers are determined
using prepositions for noun groups
To overcome the problem of ambiguous expressions we select a semantic
variant corresponding to one of the descriptions of the given verb in the
dictionary of verbs For example consider the sentence A man works with
magnetic eld As the verb work is combined with the abstract object eld
using the preposition with it can eliminate the meaning describing the place
of action
Nonsensical sentences are found as well using the dictionary of verbs
For instance consider the sentence A man plays physic The word physic
is inadmissible as the verb play is not combined with the object denoting
science
Paradigmatic relations between words of sentences  see 3 are described
in a knowledge base and dictionaries of database For a concrete sentence
these relations are presented by means of the predicate relation Syntag-
matic relations are pointed using connections between actions events and
subjects objects adverbial modiers Such connections are formed by means
of references in predicates action message thought process eventcodes of
subject objects time place etc
53 Semantic representations of compound and complex sentences
A complex declarative sentence includes clauses participle and innitive
constructions For each clause and construction the same algorithm is used
as for a simple sentence The connection between the main sentence and
subordinate constructions is realized with the predicate link
A compound sentence consists of several simple and complex sentences
The connection between independent sentences is described with the predi-
cate link
6 A knowledge base
To form answers for logical questions it is necessary to have the dictio-
nary containing explanations of words This dictionary is realized as the
knowledge base11 13 The knowledge base consists of the predicates tper-
son taction torganization which have precisely the same structure as
appropriate predicates of database person action organization Build-
ing the knowledge base is founded on algorithms of syntax and semantic
analysis described in 11
There is the set of words whose sense is implied in the system and realized
by appropriate algorithms All other words are explained by means of knowl-
edge base These explanations pose practically semanticverbal denitions
of words
The knowledge base includes the next descriptions
 general properties of physical and abstract objects
 general properties of actions processes and events
 operations and scripts
 schemas and plans
There is a special article fragment in the knowledge base for each de-
scription of concept We limit ourselves to the description of general prop-
erties for physical and abstract objects actions processes events and op-
erations The description of scripts schemas and plans is considered in
13 Previously we discuss the problem of primitives  the use of minimum
dictionary to explain words 23 part II8
The minimum dictionary contains such classes of words to present
 types of objects person organization place people animal plant
 semantic role of words in sentence subject object way tool place
time property cause purpose 
 basic actions processes and events be go move message transfer
create attend thought consist 
 the direction of moving top down left right
 scales color length weight
 abstract concepts part whole knowledge decision analysis
8The problem of primitives is considered in 29 ChKOgden had proposed the mini-
mum dictionary of English including 850 words If the control problem for complex social
systems is considered as the object domain then the correction of this dictionary is de-
manded
 physical concepts force velocity
 mathematical concepts number set point line plane
It should be emphasized that primitives are words having monosemantic
intuitively obvious meaning Such parts of speech as conjunction preposi-
tion pronoun particle are included as well in the number of primitives
To nd primitives for a set of words S describing an object domain
each denition will be presented as SubjectPredicate where Subject is a
determined word Predicate contains a generic concept and dierence If A
and B are nonintersecting sets of words then AB means that the set of
words A is determined by means of the set of words B
Denition 1 Let S is a set of words S0 S1 S2  Sn are subsets of S so
that Si  Sj   i j  0  n i 6 j S  S0  S1  S2    Sn Assume that
S1S0 S2S0  S1 S3S0  S1  S2  SnS0  S1  S2  Sn1 Then S0
is the set of primitives for S
It is easy to verify that if S
exists so that S0  S
determined using primitives
 the set of primitives S
0 Another way each word in the object domain can be
  S then for S
The general purpose of denitions is to explain the sense of words This
permits to solve logical questions which demand the analysis of connec-
tions between concepts13
It does not mean that we shall go the chain
Sj1 Sj2 Sj3  S0 in the reverse order j1  j2  j3    0  completely
For most calls to the knowledge base it is sucient to establish the confor-
mity with available facts 9
61 An article of noun
An article of noun describes general properties of physical or abstract
object To form the article of noun for example doctor at rst the phrase
of this kind is entered frame is a doctor
Then functions of this noun are indicated
9 For instance it is necessary to check the availability of weapon for a person It is
known that this person has a pistol The denition of pistol says that a pistol is a weapon
which is kept in hand It is sucient for the check
doctor examines a person
doctor determines a disease
doctor prescribes a medicine
The structure of object for example for the noun car is formed by means
of the phrase
A car consists of chassis engine
62 An article of verb
An article of verb describes general properties of actions processes and
events To form the article of verb for example to go on the phrase of
type frame is to go on is entered To describe dierent values of verb the
group of noun can be used in addition
frame is to shoot from a gun
frame is to shoot a person
Then semantic denitions and descriptions of concrete actions are en-
tered For example after the phrase frame is to learn there will be the
descriptions
to do exercises
to answer a teacher
to visit a lesson in a class
to study a textbook
After semantic denitions motives and causes of action can be described
For example after the phrase frame is to shoot a person there will be the
expressions
to kill the person by gun
to get money from the person as a subject is criminal
to pay o the person as this person outrages a subject
to annihilate the person as this person is the enemy of a subject
63 An article of operation
An operation is a sequence of actions to execute a certain purpose The
algorithm of operation is based on principles of production systems 7 All
conscious human activity includes the set of dierent operations planed be-
forehand and modied in the course of realization
The description of operation can involve several alternatives Each alter-
native is entered with a separate article For example for the purpose how
to rob an organization one can indicate the following description of the rst
alternative
frame is how to rob an organization
alternative 1  to go to the organization
alternative 1  to come in
alternative 1  to neutralize personal
alternative 1  to open safes using tools
alternative 1  to take moneys and things
alternative 1  to come out
The above sequence of actions consists of stages Each stage can contain
an action object of inuence motive and cause condition and way tool of
action
7 The comparison with other approaches to analysis of language
Let us compare the proposed approach with other approaches to semantic
analysis of language We limit ourselves to the most advanced and widely
known researches
The most deep investigations of semantics it is our opinion are based
on the representation of objects events processes and actions in the view of
frames 10 19 20 27 Firstly this approach is adequate ours in the sense
that the representation of semantics for objects states events actions and
processes is equivalent ours Secondly for long-term saving of the great
volume of information it is necessary to use modern databases ie we arrive
again at predicates Thirdly the description of frame structures is a laborious
process taking into account the great variety of objects states events and
actions The essential distinction of our approach implies that we use typical
predicates and verbal denitions from encyclopedias
The conceptual approach has gained wide acceptance 4 22 24 25 26
The main imperfection of this approach is that objects states events actions
and processes have not adequate and detailed semantic description There
is only the typication of action This simplies realization but essentially
constricts an area of solved tasks
The Russian school of semantics has gained essential successes1 6 9 28
The main feature of these works consists in the limitation of language aspects
 paradigmatic and syntagmatic relations between words 3 ch1 This
does not permit to describe the functional purpose and structure of physical
and abstract object as well as the functional role and complex character of
action and processes Of particular interest is the work 18 To describe facts
and knowledge the simple semantic net is applied  each node is a word
This does not permit to discover in full measure the semantics of words and
sentences To present processes in this work scripts were proposed
8 A formal logic system
The computer system for natural language understanding can be consid-
ered as a formal logic system S which is presented by the tuple
S  A B    
where A is an alphabet B is a set of atomic propositions  is a set of
functions  are rules of inference  is a set of Horns formulas clauses
The alphabet consists of letters ciphers special signs Symbols are
formed from letters Variables individual constants names of function and
predicates are pointed using symbols A term is an individual constant vari-
able or expression f t1 t2  tn where ti is a term f is a functional symbol
The atomic proposition P t1 t2  tn is formed from the predicate sym-
If terms do not contain variables the atomic
bol P and a list of terms
proposition is called an atom
As wellformed formulas only Horns clauses are used5
Pj  Qj
2  Qj
n j  1  m
where Pj and Qj
i are atomic propositions
Atoms and Horns clauses execute the function of axioms Rules of infer-
ence use the principle of resolution and the algorithm of unication 5 It
can prove that every algorithm can be realized using this formal system
The semantic interpretation of the formal system S is the tuple
I  D If  IP 
where D is the domain of interpretation including ranges of variables for
predicates and functions D consists of sets of integer and real numbers as
well as sets of abstract words in the alphabet A Each individual constant is
connected with a certain value of variable If is the map of sort
for each function f where M is a set from D IP is the map of sort
If f   M n  M
IP P   M1  M2    Mn  true f alse
for each predicate P where Mi is a range of a variable with the index i for
this predicate This range is included as well in D
Each concrete real object is characterized by a compact connected domain
of physical space at a given point of time and described by the above predicate
 after the substitution of individual constants instead variables The
intension of  is the aggregate of properties described by means of variables
of this predicate the extension of  is the set of real objects corresponding to
this predicate 2 ch1 The above predicates  and  after the substitution
of individual constants instead variables correspond to a set of compact
connected domains in a physical spacetime for real actions and events
The predicates   and  can use to describe possible objects actions and
events For example it is necessary for future time
Denition 2 The aggregate P  M M M M M M is called the
semantic representation of a declarative sentence if M is the set of predi-
cates  corresponding to physical objects from this sentence M is the set
of predicates  presenting actions and processes of the given sentence M is
the set of predicates  describing events or states for objects of this sentence
M is the set of predicates  corresponding to sense relations between objects
from this sentence M is the set of predicates  corresponding to categories
connected with objects actions and processes of the given sentence M is the
set of predicates  pointing to abstract objects from this sentence
For a concrete declarative sentence describing a real ie checked or pos-
sible ie unchecked fact individual constants must be substituted instead
variables in predicates M M M M M M The extension of P is the
value of truth for the given sentence 2 ch1 If the sentence describes a real
fact then it is true The intension of P in this case is the real fact corre-
sponding to a set of compact connected domains in a physical spacetime
Consider a general synthetic sentence presented by means of P If this
sentence summarizes facts using the universal and existential quantier then
the verication of a such sentence can be a hard problem 23 part 2 ch10
In this case the intension is the unication of facts
The algorithm of forming P is realized in the system LEIBNIZ using the
language PROLOG11 This language includes Horns clauses and atomic
propositions An inference is executed with the help of resolution principle
and unication algorithm To check the accuracy of semantic representation
simple and logic questions are applied12 13
9 Conclusion
The proposed objectoriented approach poses the essential advance to
solve the computer understanding problem The representation of facts and
knowledge using typical predicates permits greatly to simplify algorithms of
processing and object descriptions Besides the eectiveness of processing
is increased This is of great importance for the object domain having the
large quantity of words The main feature of our approach as compared with
other investigations is in the use of encyclopedic knowledge This permits
essentially to extend the class of solved problems
Using the proposed technology new principles of control for complex so-
cial systems can be realized both for enterprise and state structures For
example consider the problem of enterprise management At the moment
the technology ERP Enterprise Resource Planning is applied A new tech-
nology in addition to ERP is focused on ensuring of prot increase and
normal cash ow14 15 This technology involves the next functions form-
ing of intellectual interface on a natural language to communicate with a
control system joint planning of production and sales to get the maximal
prot an adaptation of control system to internal and external events
Other example concerns the domain of criminology Living computer sys-
tems save information about criminal oences by means of databases How-
ever this information can not be used in full measure for logical processing as
algorithms of semantic analysis are not applied in such systems Thus many
actual problems are solved only by criminalists Proposed algorithms permit
to create more intellectual systems based on methods of criminalistics Such
systems will form answers for natural language questions about criminal of-
fences using the purposeful selection from a database and logical processing
of selected data If at rst the great selection from the database is demanded
then it can gain serious results which it can not get by other means Some
algorithms of such task solution are considered in the paper13
By this means the presented technology discovers the perspective for
the successful solution of problems in the social domains with the help of
intellectual computer systems We shall name this direction of investigations
as computer semantics Computer semantics is the part of cybernetics that
studies questions connected with the application of semantic representations
for expressions of natural language to control problems
