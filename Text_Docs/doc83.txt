Abstract Tunnelling processes through black hole horizons have recently been investigated in the
framework of WKB theory discovering an interesting interplay with the Hawking radiation
In this
paper we instead adopt the point of view proper of QFT in curved spacetime namely we use a suitable
scaling limit towards a Killing horizon to obtain the leading order of the correlation function relevant
for the tunnelling The computation is done for certain large class of reference quantum states for scalar
elds including Hadamard states In the limit of sharp localization either on the external side or on
opposite sides of the horizon the quantum correlation functions appear to have thermal nature In both
cases the characteristic temperature is referred to the surface gravity associated with the Killing eld and
thus connected with the Hawking one Our approach is valid for every stationary charged rotating non-
extremal black hole However since the computation is completely local it covers the case of a Killing
horizon which just temporarily exists in some nite region too These results provide strong support
to the idea that the Hawking radiation which is detected at future null innity and needs some global
structures to be dened is actually related to a local phenomenon taking place even for local geometric
structures local Killing horizons existing just for a while
Introduction
As is known the Hawking radiation Ha75 is detected at future null innity of a spacetime
containing collapsing matter giving rise to a black hole At least in the case of spherical sym-
metry the existence and the features of that radiation are quite independent from the details
of the collapse However the type of the short-distance behaviour of the two-point function
of the reference state employed to describe the modes of the radiation plays a relevant role
FH90
In recent years attention has been focused on local properties of models where the
Hawking radiation is manifest Here local means in a neighborhood of a point on the event
horizon PW00 ANVZ05 APS08 APGS08 In this second approach the radiation appears to
be related with some thermal eects associated to some tunnelling process through the horizon
In particular the tunneling probability computed in the framework of semiclassical WKB ap-
proach has the characteristic thermal form eETH the Boltzmann constant being re-dened
as k  1 where TH is the Hawking temperature and E is the energy of the particle crossing the
horizon More precisely that exponential thermal factor arises when taking a limit towards the
horizon for an endpoint of the path of the classical particle
This approach is interesting because it deals with local aspects only and in this sense it seems
to be more general than the standard one In fact it may be applied to pictures where a certain
geometric structure interpreted as the horizon exists just for a while without extending
into a true global structure up to the future null innity where traditionally the Hawking
radiation is detected In DNVZZ07 HDVNZ09 even the case of a spherically symmetric black
hole in formation was analysed where no proper horizon structure exists being replaced by a
dynamical horizon Other interesting results also considering the backreaction can be found in
KM07 MV05
Within these new remarkable approaches it is however dicult to understand how the found
properties are independent form the state of the quantum system This is essentially due to
the fact that they are discussed at the quantum-mechanical level rather than the quantum-eld-
theory level
Indeed in PW00 ANVZ05 it is assumed that there is some preferred notion
of quantum particle whose wavefunction satises the Klein-Gordon equation That equation
is actually treated as a Schrodinger equation when dealing with transition probabilities within
the WKB framework However in curved spacetime there is no natural denition of quan-
tum particle unless adopting the quantum-eld-theory framework xing a preferred quasifree
reference state and building up the associated Fock-Hilbert space It does not seem that this
relevant issue is tackled in the mentioned literature Furthermore the procedure exploited in
ANVZ05 DNVZZ07 HDVNZ09 needs a Feynman prescription to make harmless a divergence
that pops up when performing the above-mentioned limit towards the horizon As a matter
of fact that procedure turns the real-axis computation into a complex-plane computation and
the very imaginary part of the WKB amplitude arising that way leads to the wanted factor
eETH  The reason for the appearance of an imaginary part in the semi-classical action has
been claried in APS08 APGS08 through a very careful analysis of the integration paths and
the adopted coordinate system without requiring any regularization procedure and remaining
in the general WKB framework while adopting the path integral viewpoint In any case that
clarication does not solve the problem of the absence of a precise notion of a quantum particle
in curved spacetime necessary to exploit the WKB formalism at quantum-mechanical level It
seems however plausible that the appearance of an imaginary part in the semi-classical action
formally equivalent to the Feynman regularization procedure is nothing but a remnant of the
choice of a preferred reference state at quantum-eld-theory level whose two-point function has
a short-distance divergence close to that of Minkowski vacuum
While sticking to the local aspects associated with states showing the Hawking radiation dif-
ferently from the references quoted above in this paper we shall deal with a denite framework
at the quantum-eld-theory level More precisely we shall focus on the two-point correlation
function xy of a quantum eld  settled in a not necessarily quasifree state  whose
short-distance divergence is essentially of Hadamard type thus generalising the short-distance
behaviour of Minkowski vacuum This is one of the hypotheses exploited in FH90 KW91 It
actually encompasses a huge class of states those that are supposed to have a clear physical
meaning Wa94 especially in relation with the problem of the renormalisation of the stress-
energy tensor and the computation of the quantum backreaction on the metric
The two-point function xy corresponds up to normalization to a probability ampli-
tude In this sense it measures the tunnelling probability through the horizon when x and y are
kept at the opposite sides of the horizon In particular if the state  is quasifree that probabil-
ity amplitude can be interpreted as a quantum-mechanical probability amplitude as wished in
the above-mentioned literature just referring to the natural notion of particle associated with
the state 
From the geometric viewpoint we shall assume to work in a suciently small neighbourhood
O of a local Killing horizon structure H also supposing that the surface gravity  is nonvanishing
and constant along the horizon We stress that the structure could be either part of the future
Killing event horizon of a stationary black hole in the full Kerr-Newman family also obtained by
matter collapse or it could be completely local and ceasing to exist in the future of O in view of
the general dynamics of the matter and the elds in the considered spacetime The requirement
that the surface gravity is constant on the local horizon means that at least locally a thermal
equilibrium has been reached since a constant surface gravity corresponds to the validity of the
zero-law of black-hole thermodynamics
The existence of a timelike Killing vector K dening H provides the preferred notions of
time and energy we intend to consider Notice that in DNVZZ07 HDVNZ09 dealing with
spherically-symmetric black holes in formation the notion energy was referred to the so called
Kodama-Hayward vector eld that in those backgrounds generalises the notion of Killing eld
Exploiting general technical achievements about Killing horizons established in KW91 and
RW92 we shall prove that independently from the choice of the quantum state in above-
mentioned class when the supports of the test functions centred on the two arguments x y of
xy become closer and closer to the horizon the two-point function acquires a thermal
spectrum with respect to the notion of time and energy associated with the Killing eld More
precisely if both arguments stay on the same side of the horizon the Fourier transform of the
two-point function presents the very Bose-Einstein form driven by the Hawking temperature
see however the remark at the end of the paper Conversely whenever the two arguments
are kept at the opposite sides of the horizon the resulting spectrum is dierent It is however
in agreement with the transition probability between two weakly coupled reservoirs which are
in thermal equilibrium at Hawking temperature Actually as in the case of the Boltzmann
distribution its spectrum decays exponentially for high energies
In both cases in order to
catch the leading contribution to the two-point function we shall exploit a suitable scaling limit
procedure HNS84 Bu96 BV95 towards the horizon Operating in this way the local thermal
nature of the correlation functions becomes manifest as a state-independent feature when the
states belong to the above-mentioned wide class
The paper is organized as follows
In the next section recalling some technical results
established in KW91 and RW92 we shall present the geometric hypotheses we shall use We
assume that the reader is familiar with the standard notions of dierential geometry of spacetimes
Wa84 In the subsequent section we shall compute the two-point function xy and
its limit approaching the horizon The last section will present a summary and some general
remarks
2 Spacetime Geometry
21 Local geometry We start our discussion xing the basic geometric setup that we employ
in this paper We henceforth consider a 4-dimensional smooth time-oriented spacetime M g
Furthermore we assume the validity of the following local geometric properties which are the
same as in RW92
Denition 21 Let O be an open subset of M  the local general geometric hypotheses
hold in O if a smooth vector eld K exists thereon such that
a K is a Killing eld for g in O
b O contains a connected 3-submanifold H the local Killing horizon that is invariant
under the group of local isometries generated by K and K aKa  0 on H
c The orbits of K in O are dieomorphic to an open interval contained in R and H admits
a smooth 2-dimensional cross section which intersects each orbit of K exactly once
d The surface gravity  ie
aKbK b  2K a  turns out to be strictly positive1 and constant on H
the function   H  R such that in view of a and b
As we said above the local Killing horizon H may represent a horizon which exists just for
a while without extending into a true global structure which reaches the future null innity
However our hypotheses are in particular valid RW92 in a neighbourhood of any point on a
black hole future horizon once that after the collapse the metric has settled down to its sta-
tionary not necessarily static form of any non-extreme black hole in the charged Kerr-Newman
family In particular those hypotheses and our results are valid for the Kerr black hole There
K is the Killing vector dening the natural notion of time in the external region of the black
hole and H is part of the event horizon
With the hypotheses a and b the integral lines of K along H can be re-parametrized to
segments of null geodesics and aKbK b  2K a holds on H where the surface gravity
  H  R is constant along each xed geodesic Wa84 The requirement d is not as strong as
it may seem at rst glance Indeed it is possible to prove that whenever a spacetime admitting
a Killing horizon satises Einstein equations and the dominant energy condition is veried the
surface gravity must be constant on the horizon Wa84 However Wa84 a result originally
obtained by Carter states that  independently of any eld equations  the surface gravity of
a Killing horizon must be constant if i the horizon Killing eld is static or ii there is an
additional Killing eld and the two Killing elds are 2-surface orthogonal At least in the case
1What actually matters is  6 0 since   0 can always be obtained in that case by re-dening K  K
  0 this is nothing but the zero-th law of black hole thermodynamics where 
the Hawking temperature of the black hole
2 amounts to
22 Killing and Bifurcate Killing horizons We now focus on the relation of the previously
introduced local geometric hypotheses and the more rigid case of a bifurcate Killing horizon A
Killing eld K determines a bifurcate Killing horizon Bo69 when it vanishes on a connected
2-dimensional acausal space-like submanifold B  M  called the bifurcation surface and K
is light-like on the two K-invariant 3-dimensional null submanifolds H H  M generated
by the pairs of null geodesic orthogonally emanated from B In particular H  H  B and
the null geodesics forming H  H are re-parametrised integral lines of K on H  H  B
By denition on H the eld K in the future of B is outward pointing The simplest example
of a bifurcate Killing horizon is that realized by the Lorentz boost K in Minkowski spacetime
Other more interesting cases are the bifurcate Killing horizons of maximally extended black
hole geometries like the Kruskal extension of the Schwarzschild even including the non-extreme
charged rotating case
For our purposes it is important to notice that in the case of a bifurcate Killing horizon
any neighbourhood O of a point on H which has empty intersection with the bifurcation sur-
face B satises the local general hypotheses stated in denition 21 It is very remarkable for
physical applications and for our subsequent discussion in particular that such a result can be
partially reversed as established by Racz and Wald RW92 RW96 Indeed if the local general
geometric hypotheses are fullled on H for a suciently small O the spacetime outside O can
be smoothly deformed preserving the geometry inside O and extending K and H to a whole
bifurcate Killing horizon in the deformed spacetime Thus when studying local properties the
bifurcation surface B can be added also to those spacetimes without bifurcation surface as
is the case of black holes formed by stellar collapse One can therefore take advantage of the
various technical properties of the bifurcate Killing horizon as we shall do in the rest of the paper
23 Killing vector geodesical distance in O and coordinates V U x3 x4
focus on a relevant coordinate patch KW91 dened in a neighbourhood of H for a bifurcate
Killing horizon generated by a Killing vector eld K similar adapted coordinates exist for H
Let U denote an ane parameter along the null geodesics forming H xing the origin at the
bifurcation surface B Each point p  H is thus determined by a corresponding pair U s
where s  B denotes the point which is intersected by the null geodesic generator through p
We shall now extend those coordinate system to a neighbourhood of H To this end for
each point q  B let us indicate by n the unique future-pointing null vector which is orthogonal
to B and has inner product 12 with 
U  We extend n on all of H by parallel transport
along the null generators of H Let V denote the ane parameter along the null geodesics
determined by n with V 0 on B It is clear that V U s determines a point in a suciently
small neighbourhood of H We are thus in a position to introduce the sought coordinate
patch If x3 x4 denote coordinates dened on a open neighbourhood in B of a point in B a
coordinate patch V U x3 x4 we call adapted to H turns out to be dened in corresponding

where metric h is that induced by g on B h is thus positive denite and it does not depend on
V U  We stress once more that in view of Racz-Walds result such a coordinate system always
exits in O provided the local geometric hypotheses hold in O regardless the actual geometry of
the spacetime outside O
In the rest of the paper referring to this geometric structure in O we shall employ the
following notation We shall indicate by SVU the cross section of O at V U constant Moreover
sp  B will be the point with coordinates x3 x4 when p  O has coordinates V U x3 x4
similarly V  U x3 x4 will denote the analogous set of coordinates for p  O The set
Gp V U   SVU is dened as the set whose image sGp V U   B coincides with the open
h-geodesical ball centred on sp with radius 
We shall denote by p p the squared g-geodesic distance taken with its Lorentzian sign
between any couple of points p p contained in some g-geodesically convex neighbourhood Fi-
nally we denote by s s the squared h-geodesic distance between points s s in some h-
geodesically convex neighbourhood contained in B
Making use of the preceding denitions and the introduced notations we are going to present
the following useful proposition which is also based on achievements in KW91
Proposition 21 Let O  M be a set on which the local general geometric hypotheses hold
and let O1 be another open set such that O1  O is compact Dene a coordinate frame adapted
to H on O as said at the beginning of section 23 so that p  O has coordinates V U x3 x4

c If O1 is as in b there exists a   0 such that for every xed p  O1 the smooth map

Proof a aKb  bKa  0 and aKbK b  2K a on H imply that KK  K on H so
that K H U

V H 0 in view of 4 The last identity in 2 is obvious
b Since the geodesically convex neighbourhoods form a base of the topology and the
projection   p 7 sp is continuous if O1 is chosen to be suciently small we have that O1 is
contained in a geodesically convex neighbourhood while at the same time O1 is contained
in a h-geodesically convex neighbourhood in B Without loss of generality we can further
assume that the latter is included in a g-geodesically convex neighbourhood of M  Thus p p
sp sp and sp sp are simultaneously well-dened if p p  O1  H for a suciently
small O1 We notice that p p is invariant under the action of the Killing isometry Hence
for any p p  H  O1 we get the identity p p  sp sp taking the limit towards B of

denite with positive-denite Hessian matrix in the coordinates x3 x4 of s Furthermore in
this case sqp 0 U  sp By continuity that Hessian matrix remains positive denite if
p p stay close to H so that any zero qp V  U of the x3 x4-gradient of SV U   p 7 p p
determines a minimum of p p Taking the Taylor expansion of xip p i  3 4 centred
on a point in H  H with respect to all the coordinates of p and p the equation for qp V  U
can easily be handled by exploiting Banachs x point theorem proving the existence and
the uniqueness of qp V  U for p  O1 suciently shrunk around H and p varying in a
neighbourhood Gp V  U of 0 U s in SV U  We recall that Gp V  U is the pre-image
through SV U   p 7 sp of a geodesic ball on B centred on sp The compactness of O1 and
a continuity argument assures that   0 can be chosen uniformly in p
d Keeping U U x3 x4 xed the expansion 3 is nothing but the rst-order V V -Taylor
expansion of p qp V  U at V  V   0 paying attention to the fact that the coordinates
x3 x4 of qp V  U depend on V through p
3 Correlations across the Killing horizon
31 General outlook We wish to compute the correlation functions of a real scalar quantum
eld  for eld observables localized in a region intersecting a Killing horizon Thus we assume
that a quantum system is described by a corresponding -algebra A generated by the unit I and
eld operators f  for all f  C0 M  For our purposes only minimal properties of such
a quantum eld theory are necessary namely that the abstract eld operator  is smeared
with compactly supported smooth functions f  C0 M  and furthermore that i the map
f 7 f  is linear ii f   f  and iii f  g  0 when suppf  and suppg are
causally separated We stress that do not assume that  satises any specic eld equation so
that in principle our approach may encompass interacting elds
If  is an algebraic state on A the correlation functions we are interested in are the bilinear
functionals that map real smooth functions f f to f f We shall specify shortly the
form of the test functions f f For the moment we only say that their supports are taken in
a open region O containing a Killing eld K and which satises the local general geometric
hypotheses We nally assume that O can be covered by coordinates adapted to H dened at
the beginning of section 23 with U and V increasing towards the future
Later we shall restrict O to a subregion O1 as in b of proposition 21 because we want to
use the expression 3 for the geodesic distance The region O1 when considered in coordinates
V U s can always be taken of the form a a  b c  S where S  B is an open relatively
compact subset Notice that shrinking O1 around the region of H  O1 determined by b c S
means taking a  0 smaller and smaller
In the suciently small neighbourhood O1 one nds gK K  2U V  OV 2 in view of
1 a in proposition 21 and V g22H  0 arising from 2
22H  0 As a consequence K
turns out to be spacelike in Os  p  O1  V p  0 and timelike in Ot  p  O1  V p  0
Referring to stationary black holes O1 can be interpreted as a suciently small region around
a point on the future horizon the only horizon existing when the black hole is produced by
collapsing matter There Os is part of the internal region containing the singularity while Ot
stays in the external region stationary with respect to the Killing time associated to K In this
way a notion of energy related to K can be dened in Ot at least and we will take advantage
of it shortly
We recall that in the GNS representation of a state  on the -algebra of eld observables
the expectation value of the product of two elds  f f with f f real is equal to
hbf bfi where  is the cyclic vector and bf  is the eld operator represented as a
proper operator on the GNS Hilbert space Hence up to normalization  f f 2 can be
interpreted as a transition probability between the states bf  and bf In this sense
when f and f are localized on the opposite sides of the horizon the regions Os and Ot the
correlation function  f f provides a measure of the transition probability through the
horizon
Inspired by the ideas proper of the scaling-limit procedure HNS84 Bu96 BV95 in order to
obtain the leading order to that probability we shall consider some sequences of smearing
functions f and f whose support become closer and closer to the horizon H in the limit
  0 Thus we are going to compute the limit
0
cid0ffcid1
where f and f are smooth functions supported in O1 whose supports become closer and closer
to the horizon as long as   0
In contrast to the discussion presented in HNS84 where the scaling limit towards a point is
analysed with the proposed procedure we are instead considering scaling limits towards a null
surface so that the results presented in HNS84 cannot be automatically applied to the present
Since only the short distance behaviour of the two-point function of the state is relevant for
our computation we select the class of allowed states looking at their ultraviolet features We
assume that the two-point function of  is a distribution of DM  M  dened as
x xf xfxdxdx
cid0f fcid1  lim
0ZMM
where the integral kernels  have the following form
x x 
x x12
42x x
 wx x 
whenever the test functions are supported in a xed relatively compact geodesically convex
neighbourhood In the previous expression x x  x x  2iT x  T x  2 and T
is a xed arbitrarily chosen time function KW91 The smooth strictly-positive function  is
the so-called Van Vleck-Morette determinant Wa94 KW91 We nally assume that w has a
less singular behaviour with respect to that of x x1 in the sense we are going to specify
An important case is
wx x  vx x ln x x  wx x
for some xed smooth functions v w
With this form of w the right-hand side of 6 is a straightforward generalization of the short
distance structure of the two-point function of Minkowski vacuum for a Klein-Gordon scalar
eld if one also suppose that the eld  satises the Klein-Gordon eld equation   V   0
where V  M  R is any xed smooth function In particular 6-7 are fullled by all the
quasifree states of Hadamard type Wa94 that are dened by 6-7 with a further requirement
on the form of v related to the Klein-Gordon equation Those states are supposed to be the
most signicant states for free QFT in curved spacetime Wa94 and are very often employed in
the rigorous description of thermal properties of quantum elds in the presence of black holes
KW91 FH90 DMP09 However since we do not need to consider free elds or any precise
eld equation we further relax the requirements adopting 6 but in place of 7 assuming a
weaker pair of requirements in the following p  V U s p  V  U s
w is -uniformly bounded by a locally M 2-integrable function
W1 wp p  wp p as   0 almost everywhere in p p for some function w and
W2 wV U s V  U s  wU s U s almost everywhere in U s U s when V V  
0 0 for some function w on H2 and w is V V -uniformly bounded by a locally H2-integrable
function
Notice that W1 and W2 are satised by w whenever it satises 7 and thus they are
valid for Hadamard states in particular
To conclude few words about the precise construction of the functions f f are necessary
Let f and f be some smooth functions with compact support contained respectively in the
regions Os and Ot The associated functions f f are dened as
fV U x3 x4 
fcid18 V
 U x3 x4cid19 
fV U x3 x4 
fcid18 V
 U x3 x4cid19    0 
As in other scaling-limit procedures the pre-factor 1 is introduced in order to keep the result
nite Finally to avoid divergences due to zero-modes in the limit   0 we assume that f f
are of the form2
F 
for xed F F   C0 O1
Alternatively sticking to generic smooth compactly supported functions f and f the divergent
contribution of zero-modes has to be subtracted at the end of the computations With the as-
sumptions 8 and 9 the   0 limit of  ff is precisely the notion of scaling limit
of  V xV y towards the horizon we shall employ The result of such limit represents
the rst contribution to the sought transition probability in an ideal asymptotic expansion for
small 
32 Computation We are in a position to present the most important result of this paper
The proof of the following theorem exploits techniques similar to those employed in the appendix
B of KW91 However our result diers from those presented there because we are not interested
in studying the restriction of the states to the horizon in the symplectic approach while we intend
to compute the scaling limit of the state in the 4D smeared formalism The relevant part for
our computation arises from the V  V  contribution to  in 3 whereas in KW91 only
the U  U contribution plays a relevant role In this respect there are some similarities to
the analysis performed in FH90 although here neither we restrict ourself to the spherically
symmetric case nor we consider any equation of motion for the quantum eld nor we suppose
that the Killing structure extends up to the future null innity as done in FH90
Theorem 31 Assume that the general local geometric hypotheses as in Def21 hold in O
covered by coordinates adapted to H suppose that O1  O is a suciently small open neigh-
bourhood of a point on H with O1  O compact Assume also that the state  has two-point
function given by a distribution as in 6 that veries the requirements W1 and W2 above
in particular w may have the form 7 and may be a Hadamard state for Klein-Gordon elds
If f f are taken as in 8-9 and  is the measure associated to the 2-metric on the bifurcation
surface B it holds

p p in a suciently small O1pp p  2 ifpsp sp    We stress that the limit
in   0 in 11 allows us to take O1 as small as we need Thus by denition of  and of
Gp V  U the denominator 0p p  216 when 1  6 0 Hence the integrand of the
second integral in 12 is jointly smooth in all variables including  even for   0 Then in view
of Lebesgues dominated convergence theorem the limit in  can be computed simply taking
  0 in the integrand For the same reason after changing the integration variables V V  to
V V  the subsequent limit as   0 can be computed under the sign of integration The
resulting integral vanish because in the V V  variables it is noting but the integral of the V V 
derivative of some compactly supported smooth function Thus only the former integral in 12
may survive the limits in 11 Let us focus on that integral Making use of c in proposition
21 in each set Gp V  U  SV U  we dene the function p  0 such that
p p  p2  p qp V  U 
In view of c in proposition 21 the pair   where     is the standard polar angle in
geodesic polar coordinates centred on qp V  U determines an allowable local chart for any
p  Gp V  U see also the appendix B of KW91 that is smooth barring the usual conical
singularity for   0 Notice that due to the last statement in c of proposition 21 when
p  H and V   0  coincides with the standard geodesic radial coordinate centred on sp  B
In the following we shall employ that coordinate system in each Gp V  U Making nally
use of d in proposition 21 and choosing T  U  V 2 we can re-arrange the former integral
in 12 so that

where 12p p  12p pp p From now on we shall assume that the integral in p
is performed before that in p Using this coordinate system the integral in the right-hand side
of 13 can be rewritten3 as
Z 12p pfpfp
lncid02  p qp V  Ucid1p det g

where det g is the determinant of the metric in the coordinates   V  U which parametrically
depends on p Notice that the domain of integration in  is bounded by the support of the
function p p embodied in  For V  V   0 the metric takes the form 1 on B which
does not depend on U U V V  any more while R vanishes By direct inspection one sees that
 det g
is continuous tends to 12 when p  p in H and its -derivative is continuous for  6 0
it being however bounded there If  R det g dp are respectively dened as  R det g
and dp with V and V  rescaled by  changing coordinates V V   V V  the integral in
the right-hand side of 13 can be rearranged as

Leaving unchanged the remaining integrations we can rst integrate by parts in the polar
coordinate  We obtain two boundary terms which are integrals in the remaining variables
evaluated respectively at   0 and   0 suciently large and an integral in all the variable
including  When taking the limits as   0 and   0 concerning the integral representing
the boundary term at   0 we can pass both limits under the sign of the integration by
straightforward application of Lebesgues dominated convergence theorem The result is that
in the integrand only V F and V F  depend on V V  hence performing the integrations in V
and V  both integrals vanish because F and F  are of compact support The remaining boundary
term leads to the limit

g0 0 do not depend on V and the apparently divergent term results once more in the integral
3We henceforth assume to cut the complex plane along the negative real axis to dene the function ln z
of a derivative of a compactly supported smooth function The limits of the remaining terms
can then be computed in the given order exploiting Lebesgues theorem We eventually obtain

33 The correlation functions and their thermal spectrum As is known eg see
Wa84 a timelike Killing vector eld on the one hand provides a natural notion of time which
is nothing but the parameter of the integral lines of the eld On the other hand it gives a
natural notion of conserved energy for elds and matter propagating in the region where the
Killing vector is present We are interested in computing the energy spectrum of the correlation
functions ff seen by an observer that moves along the curves generated by the
Killing eld K and computed with respect to the associated Killing time More precisely
exploiting Theorem 31 we intend to compute that energy spectrum in the limit of test functions
squeezed on the local Killing horizon As the supports of the test functions are innitesimally
close to the horizon we have to focus on what happens for V  0 Therefore we truncate every
component of the formula 2 for the Killing vector at the dominant order in powers of V and
we make use of the right-hand side of 10 as denition of correlation two-point function Now
 is the Killing time namely the integral parameter of the curves tangent to K In the said
approximation the rst identity in the right-hand side of 2 implies
V    e
for V  0 that is in Ot and V    e
for V  0 that is in Os
up to an additive constant in the denition of  which in principle could depend on the integral
curve Our choice is coherent with the standard denitions of  in Schwarzschild spacetime
where  is the Killing time in the external region Indeed we recover those cases in the limit
where the  -constant 2-surfaces are close to the Killing horizon We now examine two situations
a Both the supports of f and f stay in Ot
In that case thinking of the functions F F  as functions of   instead of V V  in view of 15
we can re-arrange the found expression for the correlation function as
ff  lim

64Z F  U xF  U x

where we have used the fact that the functions F and F  are compactly supported by construction
even adopting the new coordinate frame It is known that in the sense of the Fourier transform

where H  2 is the inverse Hawking temperature and we have dened the smooth function
that for E   vanishes faster than En n  0 1 2    uniformly in the remaining coor-
dinates The thermal content of the found correlation function is manifest in view of the Bose
factor 1  eH E1 where the Hawking temperature 1H takes place - xed with respect to
a generally arbitrary choice of the scale necessary to dene the Killing eld K see the remark
below
b The support of f stays in Os while that of f stays in Ot Tunnelling processes
As previously remarked up to normalization ff2 can be interpreted as a tunnelling
probability through the horizon Employing 15 once more we end up with

As expected from the fact that in this case the support of f is always disjoint from the support
of f we can directly pass the limit   0 under the sign of integration simply dropping i in
the denominator Taking advantage of the convolution theorem the nal result reads

Notice that if the arbitrary additive constant dening  in Ot were dierent from that in Os
then a further exponential exp icE would take place in the numerator for some real constant

packets concentrated around to a high value of the energy E0 19 leads to the estimate for the
tunnelling probability

in agreement with the ideas in PW00 ANVZ05 It is nevertheless worth remarking that the
interpretation of E as an energy is questionable for the packet in the internal region Os since
the Killing vector K is spacelike therein
Remark4 It is worth stressing that if K is a future-directed Killing eld for every constant
c  0 cK is a future-directed Killing eld again In general there is no way to x the scale
c This arbitrariness in the denition of K enters the denition aKbK b  2K a of the
associated surface gravity  and in turn it aects the denition of the Hawking temperature
TH  2 In the case of an asymptotically at say Schwarzschild black hole one uses the
asymptotic behaviour of the Killing isometries to normalize the Schwarzschild time parameter
to correspond to ordinary time at innity and of course energy is also dened with respect
to innity xing the scale c However if one is assuming only the existence of a local horizon
and not necessarily any connection with any innity region in the absence of further physical
requirement there is nothing to set the scale So while it may be correct to say that one has
a thermal spectrum in the found expressions for lim0 ff it does not seem very
meaningful to claim that this corresponds to any particular value for the Hawking temperature
in the general case
4 Conclusions
In this paper we have analysed the correlation functions and the tunnelling amplitude through a
Killing horizon for quantum states in a certain physically relevant class of states that includes
the states of Hadamard type Although the equation of motion does not play a relevant role the
results are in particular valid for scalar Klein-Gordon particles The computation is performed
in the limit of test functions squeezed on the Killing horizon The considered local Killing
horizon with positive constant surface gravity may be a part of the complete horizon of a
black hole including non-static black holes as the non-extremal charged rotating one or it
may just temporarily exist in a nite region The considered states are generally not required
to be invariant with respect to the isometry group generated by the Killing eld We have
established that in the limit of test functions sharply localized on the opposite sides of the
horizon the correlation functions have a thermal nature namely they have a spectrum which
decays exponentially as expHawkingE for high energies The energy E and the inverse
4The authors are grateful to one of the referees for this important remark
Hawking temperature are dened with respect to the Killing eld generating the horizon see
however the remark at the end of the previous section This achievement is in agreement with
the result obtained in other recent papers although here it is obtained in the framework of
the rigorous formulation of quantum eld theory on curved spacetime While in the mentioned
literature quantum-mechanical approaches are exploited leaving unresolved the issue concerning
the strongly ambiguous notion of quantum particle in curved spacetime
Furthermore we have also established that when both test functions are localized in the
external side of the horizon a full Bose spectrum at the Hawking temperature arises in the
expression of the correlation functions In both cases the computation is completely local ie
the nature of the geometry at innity does not matter and the results do not depend on the
employed states provided they belong to the mentioned class These results give a strong support
to the idea that the Hawking radiation that it is usually presented as a radiation detected at
future lightlike innity and needs the global structure of a black hole Killing horizon can
also be described as a local phenomenon for local geometric structures local Killing horizons
existing just for a while A fundamental ingredient in our computation is the fact that the
nonvanishing surface gravity is constant on the Killing horizon Thus we could exploit the result
in RW92 and in turn some technical constructions of KW91 Even if this requirement can
easily be physically interpreted as the geometrical description of the thermodynamic equilibrium
it would be interesting to consider from our viewpoint the case of a black hole in formation
where there are no Killing horizons at all The latter situation has already been investigated
at least in the presence of spherical symmetry as in DNVZZ07 HDVNZ09 In those papers
the WKB approach as well as the theory of Kodama-Hayward and the associated notion of
dynamical horizon are exploited As a preliminary comment we notice that the computation of
the scaling limit towards the horizon does not seem to require the presence of a proper Killing
horizon which could be replaced by some more generic null hypersurface
