Abstract
I review recent observations on the evolution of quasars describe
new surveys for quasars at z  5 and for quasars with z  33 down to
luminosities corresponding to L galaxies and note the possible connec-
tion between the evolution of the star formation rate in young galaxies
and the evolution of quasars
Introduction
I appreciate the opportunity to give the rst talk at this meeting and commend
the Scientic Organizing Committee for bringing together researchers on both
quasars and galaxies I wish to mention some of the connections between the two
elds that may be valuable for present and future research Indeed if quasars
are powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies the elds are
not distinct Instead they are concerned with dierent stages of the formation
of galactic- sized objects in the universe
In the case of quasars at z  3 for example we may be seeing the results
of the initial collapse of material at the center of a galaxy and its fueling by the
infall of additional matter The steep decline in the space density of quasars from
z  2 to the present may be caused by the decline in the fueling rate As galaxies
complete their formation as their interaction rate presumably declines and as
the universe continues to expand the amount of matter falling to the centers
of galaxies likely declines thus reducing quasar activity Alfonso Cavaliere will
describe his work on this model later this morning
In the meantime the repair of HST the advent of the Keck telescopes and
the work on many dierent surveys have revolutionized observational research
on the formation and evolution of galaxies The abilities to discover to obtain
images with resolutions near 01 arcsec and to do spectroscopy of galaxies with
redshifts greater than 3 and down to 25th magnitude are truly changing our
views of the universe
At the same time I think we quasar researchers are feeling rather dis-
tressed by all the excitement and developments with young galaxies Not only
have galaxy researchers pushed into the realm formerly occupied exclusively by
quasars but Franx et al 1997 have reached beyond the highest known quasar
redshift to become the current recordholders in the most-distant-known-object
in the universe sweepstakes We will hear from Marijn Franx about the lensed
galaxy at z  492 on Tuesday Perhaps losing the redshift record will spur
quasar researchers to new depths so to speak More seriously the pursuit of
both galaxies and quasars at high redshift is important because it will tell us
the epoch at which highly luminous objects rst appeared in the universe
In this talk I wish to discuss three topics
1 Recent observational results on the evolution of quasars
2 Current surveys my collaborators and I are carrying out for high-redshift
quasars
3 The connection between the luminosity density of quasars and the star
formation rate in high-redshift galaxies
As we shall see the results of 1 provide motivation for 2 while 3 is of
interest because of the similarity of the evolution of the quasar space density
with redshift to the evolution of the star-formation or metal-enrichment rate in
young galaxies Madau et al 1996 Connolly et al 1997
I will concentrate on optically selected quasars Subsequently Isobel Hook
will describe the recent results for radio-selected quasars and Stefano Cristiani
will discuss his surveys for optical quasars
2 Recent Observational Results on the Evolution of Quasars
When plotted on a linear scale against cosmic lookback time   the space density
of quasars shows a striking distribution with a peak near   085 q0  05 and
a width at half maximum of  01 the age of the universe Fig 1 This plot
continues to demand questions such as Was   085 the main epoch of quasar
formation If so why does the peak occur at that time and why does it have
such a narrow width Here I wish to concentrate on the observational issues
In Figure 2 I plot the logarithm of the luminosity density for various quasar
surveys against redshift I choose the luminosity density in this case both for the
comparison to be made in section 4 and because this parameter characterizes
how the integrated energy output of quasars varies with redshift
To illustrate the current observational state of quasar evolution Fig 2
shows the parameterization from the AAT survey Boyle Shanks and Peterson
1988 Boyle 1991 for 0  z  22 together with results from the Large Bright
Quasar Survey LBQS Hewett Foltz and Chaee 1993 the Edinburgh survey
Goldschmidt and Miller 1997 and the Homogeneous Bright Quasar Survey
HBQS La Franca and Cristiani 1997
One of the major recent observational questions at low redshift and bright
magnitudes has been whether the Schmidt and Green 1983 results and the
Boyle parameterization under-represent the true population As we see in Fig 2
the LBQS and Edinburgh surveys do indicate a signicant correction is needed
the HBQS less so My assessment is that a correction on the order of a factor of
several is now indicated at z  04 and thus the Boyle parameterization should
be modied for these redshifts and luminosities Note that this correction is
important but it does not change the qualitative view of Fig 1 because the
space density of quasars at z  05 is still down by two orders of magnitude
from the peak

surveys
At intermediate redshifts 2  z  3 we see from Fig 2 that the quasar
luminosity densifty reaches its peak The calibrated surveys of Warren Hewett
and Osmer 1994 WHO and Schmidt Schneider and Gunn 1995 SSG pro-
vide the main data in this interval WHO nd the peak to be at z  33 while
SSGs results in combination with Boyles indicate that the peak is closer to
z  2 I believe additional work is needed to resolve this issue which can be
done with surveys aimed particularly at the 2  z  3 interval Again the
uncertainty does not change the qualitative look of Fig 1 but it does indicate
that the uncertainty in the location of the peak is  007 times the age of the
universe
At higher redshifts z  3 we see in Fig 2 that the WHO SSG and KDC
Kenneck Djorgovski and de Carvalho 1995 surveys all show good agreement
at z  43 This provides I think persuasive evidence that the apparent space
density of optically selected quasars which are the bulk of the population does
decline for z  3
However Fig 2 also shows that the WHO and SSG parameterizations are
markedly dierent in the slope of the decline with WHO being much steeper
This occurs for two reasons the dierent evolutionary decline with increasing
redshift and the dierent slopes of the luminosity function at the bright end
When projected to z  5 the WHO and SSG results give predictions for the
number of quasars that dier by more than an order of magnitude Clearly
additional surveys over the interval 3  z  5 are needed to place the quasar
space density and the slope of its decline with redshift on rmer ground

3 New Surveys for High-Redshift Quasars
With the success of the multicolor technique for nding quasars at high redshift
WHO KDC Irwin McMahon and Hazard 1993 IMH and the development of
multi-CCD cameras it is now possible to carry out surveys that will either nd
quasars at z  5 or set signicant upper limits on their space density Because
we do not know well either what the slope of the luminosity function is at such
redshifts or the evolutionary decline with redshift it is important to survey a
wide range of surface area and limiting magnitude Here I will describe the
surveys being done by our groups other groups are also doing large programs
for example Hewett and Warren Schmidt Schneider and Gunn Irwin and
McMahon the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
To aid in visualizing the relation of the dierent surveys Fig 3 shows
a plot of the log of their area vs
limiting magnitude The range in area is
from 500 deg2 with the Curtis and Burrell Schmidts in conjunction with the
2nd Palomar Sky Survey to 44 arcmin2 in the Hubble Deep Field HDF The
range in limiting magnitudes is roughly 18 to 28 The main properties of the
surveys are described below
31 Deep Multicolor Survey DMS
P Hall J Kenneck P Osmer R Green and S Warren are the investigators
This survey covers 083 deg2 in UBVRI75I86 to limiting magnitudes of 221
to 238 5 To date 55 quasars with 03  z  43 have been conrmed
spectroscopically along with 43 compact narrow emission-line galaxies Hall et
al 1996ab Kenneck et al 1997 A catalog of 21375 stellar objects with
positions magnitudes in all six bands and error estimates for the magnitudes
is being prepared for publication
32 Bright z  5 Survey
This is being carried out by J Kenneck M Smith P Osmer R de Carvalho
A Athey and P Martini It combines existing data from the Digitized Palomar
Sky Survey DPOSS with new data taken at the Curtis and Burrell Schmidts in
the z09 band to nd z  5 quasars to a limiting magnitude of i  18 Ly 
emission in z  5 quasars will make them very red in g  i and the z band data
help in eliminating late-type stars To date data have been taken for 500 deg2
and spectroscopic observations have been made of candidates selected from 300
deg2 No z  5 quasars have yet been conrmed
33 BTC50 Survey
E Falco P Schechter C Kochanek R Green M Smith J Kenneck P Os-
mer P Hall and M Postman are the investigators for this survey which is
making use of the BTC camera at CTIO to search for z  5 quasars gravita-
tional lenses and distant galaxy clusters The goal is to cover 50 deg2 in BVI
to limiting magnitudes of 25 to 26 in B and V and 24 in I Already 20 deg2 of
data are in hand
34 Big Faint Quasar Survey BFQS
P Hall J Kenneck P Osmer R Green and M Smith are also using the
BTC camera to cover 8 deg2 in BRI to limits of 267 257 and 246 to search
for quasars with 33  z  50 down to luminosities equivalent to those of L
galaxies This survey will also be very useful for studies of the evolution of eld
galaxies
35 Quasars in the Hubble Deep Field HDF
A Conti J Kenneck P Martini P Osmer R Pogge and D Weinberg are
searching for quasars and AGNs in the HDF by making use of the UBVI im-
ages From numerical simulations we nd the limiting magnitudes for classifying
objects with the crude combine images to be 252 270 268 and 258 No clear
z  4 candidates have been found so far One known emission-line galaxy with
z  337 has been independently recovered it serves as a check on our modeling
procedures In addition there are two possible UVX candidates
4 Quasars at z  5
To date I believe approximately 103 deg2 of sky have been surveyed at brighter
magnitudes I  18 by our group and by Hewett and Warren so far with
negative results for quasars at z  5 While the spectroscopy is not nished we
do have about 120 M-type stars which should yield a signicant improvement in
determining the lower end of the stellar luminosity function In the meantime
Franx et al 1997 have discovered a lensed galaxy at z  492 Are we hitting
the wall on distant quasars
In the spirit of Fig 1 and 2 I show in Fig 4 the currently known space
density of z  5 quasars both in a log N vs z and N vs  format Obviously
we need to ll in the diagram for the rst 7 of cosmic time to understand when
quasars rst became visible

5 The Connection between Quasars and Galaxies
The results of Madau et al 1996 1997 on the evolution of the star-formation
history of galaxies show evidence for the star-formation rate SFR to increase
with redshift by an order of magnitude from z  0 to z  1 and then decline
toward higher redshift The behavior is reminiscent of but not identical to the
evolution of the space density of quasars The SFR peaks at a lower redshift and
has a broader distribution Is there a connection between the SFR in galaxies
and quasar evolution
It is worthwhile to investigate the possible connection The same processes
responsible for the fueling of quasars may well trigger star formation in the host
galaxies Such processes include galaxy interactions and instabilities Although
the energy sources for stars and quasars are dierent the integrated ultraviolet
luminosity density reects the SFR for young stars in the case of high-redshift
galaxies and the fueling rate in the case of quasars In addition both luminos-
ity densities are directly observable quantities and both have impacts on the
ionization state of the interstellar and intergalactic media at high redshift
To illustrate the connection I use two forms  The rst Fig 5 left is the
log of the quasar luminosity density adapted from Fig 2 and the log of the
luminosity density for the 2800A emission of galaxies adapted from Connolly et
al 1997 vs redshift We see that the luminosity densities of the two classes
of objects are within an order of magnitude of each other When we consider
that the stellar values have been integrated over a Schechter luminosity function
to represent the entire population of objects while the quasar values are only
for luminous MB  26 quasars the total quasar luminosity density may

5 right shows a linear plot of the metal enrichment rate MER and quasar
luminosity density vs
lookback time The MER is shown because it is less
sensitive than the inferred star formation rate to assumptions about the slope
of the initial mass function Madau et al 1996 This form shows more directly
the oset in cosmic time 025 of the age of the universe and the greater breadth
of the MER relative to quasars1
Although there are still uncertainties in the determination of the SFR and
MER for young galaxies and in the nature of quasar evolution Fig 5 does
provide a framework for observational mapping of the star formation history
and the evolution of nuclear activity in young galaxies Continued observational
work in turn should lead to improved understanding of how galaxies form and
evolve
6 Summary and Future Work
1 The main observational properties of the evolution of optically selected
bright R  20 quasars are reasonably well established for 0  z 
45 However we still need to determine better the redshift at which
1Subsequent to the meeting Boyle and Terlevich 1997 independently noted this connection
and discussed it in terms of the starburst model for quasars
the evolution peaks and especially the slope of its decline toward higher
redshift
2 We now have the observational tools to observe both quasars and galaxies
to z  5 and to magnitudes  25 Thus we have the capability to map
observationally their evolution down to L luminosities at z  5 and 01
L at z  2 The data will be important to improving our theoretical
understanding of galaxy formation and evolution
3 There is reason to expect the discovery of galaxies and quasars at z  5
the increment in cosmic time is only 0001 of the age of the universe
compared to the most distant object now known z  492
Do quasars exist at z  5 Perhaps we will have an answer by the time of the
next meeting on this topic In any case exploring the properties and evolution of
both galaxies and quasars at high redshift will be one of our grandest adventures
