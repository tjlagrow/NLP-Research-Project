The immunological synapse is a patterned collection of dierent types of receptors and ligands
that forms in the intercellular junction between T Cells and antigen presenting cells APCs during
recognition The synapse is implicated in information transfer between cells and is characterized
by dierent spatial patterns of receptors at dierent stages in the life cycle of T cells We obtain
a minimalist model that captures this experimentally observed phenomenology A functional RG
analysis provides further insights

T lymphocytes T cells are the orchestrators of the adaptive immune response in complex organisms A key event
during activation of the immune response is T cell recognition of cells that display peptides derived from foreign
antigens on their surface 1 Recent experiments 2 3 4 5 6 have vividly demonstrated that during this recognition
process a highly organized pattern of dierent types of receptors and ligands forms in the intercellular junction between
T cells and antigen presenting cells This recognition motif is several microns in diameter and since it is implicated
in information transfer between the cells it is called the immunological synapse Formation of a synapse is also
characteristic of an earlier stage in the life cycle of T cells Immature T cells thymocytes are selected in the thymus
so that they are not activated by peptides derived from the organism itself 1 In the thymus thymocytes interact
with cells that display self peptides on their surface Thymocytes that bind strongly are deleted by apoptosis The
synapses formed during thymocyte selection are distinctly dierent in character 7 8 from those observed during
mature T cell activation Understanding the mechanisms via which synapses form under dierent circumstances and
the biological purpose of creating dierent spatial patterns of cell surface receptors are active areas of research In
addition to the biological signicance an understanding of these issues may also inspire the creation of synthetic
mimics that could carry out biomimetic recognition tasks which could be useful in applications such as targeted drug
delivery
In this letter starting from a model proposed by Qi et al 9 we develop a minimalist model that captures some of
the essential physics of synapse formation when apposing membranes contain complementary pairs of receptors and
ligands The model allows us to calculate a phase diagram which delineates the conditions that lead to a transition
from synaptic patterns characteristic of mature T cells to those observed during thymocyte selection This phase
diagram may serve as a guide for the design of synthetic analogs
Consider two membranes containing complementary pairs of receptors and ligands The intramembrane motion of
receptors and ligands is determined either by diusion or a directed velocity toward the center of the junction 10
Complementary receptors and ligands can bind to each other if apposed Dierent receptor-ligand complexes have
dierent topographical size 11 and hence the rate of association depends upon local intermembrane separation
The receptor-ligand complexes also dissociate at a prescribed rate For the case where there are only two types of
receptors-ligand pairs TCR-MHCp and LFA1-ICAM1 in the case of the T cell immunological synapse the pertinent
equations are

The reduction of the full set of equations to one determining the separation z is reminiscent of the elimination of
counter-ions in constructing the PoissonBoltzmann equation where the concentration of counter-ions is obtained
from the Boltzmann weight of a potential itself determined self-consistently from the counterion charge prole Here
z plays the role of the potential while the protein complexes are analogous to the counterions
Bound receptor-ligand complexes do not favor membrane shape changes that deform the bond from its natural
length We thus use a harmonic approximation for the functional form of the bond elasticity energy ie Biz

into KonKof f  and shall be ignored henceforth The natural lengths of receptor-ligand proteins are taken to be those
appropriate for the T cells z1  zT M  15nm and z2  zLI  42nm 11 13 with corresponding spring constants
of i given below With this approximation the dynamical Eq 4 takes the form measuring time in units such that

Eq 6 was solved numerically by a nite dierence method Initially the upper membrane was assigned a parabolic
shape in the contact region and the intermembrane distance was kept constant  50nm outside the contact region
For the membrane parameters we use experimentally determined values 14 of   700kBT m2 and   400kBT 
and for the bond elasticity we take 1  13nm and 2  5nm 9 Simulations were carried out for various ratios

Zero Noise In the absence of noise   0 Eq 6 is a relaxational dynamics toward the minimum of the potential
V z subject to the imposed boundary conditions For C 
2 the minimum at zT M is deeper and indeed in the
numerical simulations a central cluster of TCR-MHCp complex forms quickly in the intercellular contact area As
the boundary of the contact region is kept at a constant height close to zLI the longer LFA1-ICAM1 moves toward
the boundary giving rise to a structure very similar to the nal synaptic pattern obtained in the experimental and
numerical studies 3 9 15 16

synapse is never formed Rather we observe see Fig 2b uctuating patterns with eeting clusters of TCR-MHCp
forming at various locations in a sea of LFA1-ICAM1 Note that this pattern is dierent in character from the one
observed for C 
2  1 in the noiseless case Such dynamic patterns have been observed in recent experiments using
DP thymocytes 7 8 and can be understood using the simple picture of relaxational motion in a potential with
two minima As we lower the TCR concentration the minimum at z  zT M becomes shallower and eventually the
minimum near z  zLI corresponds to the global equilibrium However thermal uctuations allow sampling of the
region near the minimum at z  zT M  This will favor sporadic aggregation of TCR-MHCp at random places As long
as the barrier between the two minima is not very large such transient uctuations will be frequent
The eects of thermal uctuations can be estimated by expanding V z to quadratic order around each of its
minima The total energy cost of a deformation of wavenumber p is given by Eip cid0kBT C

The location of the transition between the two classes of patterns can now be estimated from F 
2  Thermal noise
enhances the minimum with larger  width because of its larger entropy Hence the more exible bond is formed
more easily when thermal noise is present 17 Fig 3 shows that the larger the temperature the smaller the value of
fc This phase diagram could serve as a guide for the design of synthetic systems as it shows how to manipulate
conditions such that synaptic patterns characteristic of mature T cells or thymocytes are realized

Self consistency of the above quadratic expansion requires that the extent of the uctuations should be less than

parameters the constant term in the denominator of Eq 9 dominates until it is cut-o by the bending rigidity at
distances of the order of 1m The overall size of the synapse is of the order of 10m 3 It is then easy to estimate
the value of the integral and we nd that the ratios W11 and W22 are of the order of 01 While these estimated
uctuations are smaller than the width of the attractive potentials they are signicant enough to make nonlinear
corrections to the above quadratic expansion important Thus the phase diagram in Fig 3 using Eq 8 should be

When anharmonic corrections are signicant an alternative approach is to employ a functional renormalization
group RG scheme used 18 19 20 in the context of wetting transitions It consists of the following steps 1
The uctuating eld zx is divided into two parts corresponding to small wavenumbers 0  p  b and large
wavenumbers b  p   2 The large wavenumber uctuations b  p   are integrated out to yield a
coarse grained Hamiltonian and 3 The system is rescaled to new coordinates x  xb and z x  zx The eld
z does not need to be scaled in two dimensions The second step can only be done approximately and a rst order
expansion of the potential V z leads to the linear approximation18

The soft wall renormalizes into an error function of width  while the variance of the Gaussian potential is increased
by 2 Thus the bigger the width of the potential the deeper it gets due to the uctuations as it allows more
exibility entropy in bond formation For large values of the width  highly uctuating surfaces the location of
2  fc  21  038 Due to the factor of b2 in Eq 12 the net potential
the transition point is shifted to C 
gets stronger under RG and the linear approximation eventually breaks down
The RG transformation should be extended to a rescaling factor b at which the curvature at the minimum of the
renormalized potential is such that the resulting uctuations in width are comparatively small Beyond this scale
a quadratic expansion around the minimum of the eective potential should be valid As demonstrated previously
typical parameters for the synapse yield a bare potential at which the above criterion is barely satised Thus the

linear RG approximation is of limited practical value in this context It may however yield interesting information
about the global form of the phase diagram as the concentrations C 
2 are further reduced From the double
well shape of the potential we anticipate that the overall phase diagram consists of a line of discontinuous transitions
separating preferences in the synapse for TM or LI bonds This line is located at C 
2  1 for large concentrations
and moves to C 
2  12 at lower concentrations It presumably terminates at an Ising critical point when the
uctuations in width become of the order of the separation zT M  zLI between the two minima Suciently small

2 should also result in an unbinding transition which is located at C 
values of C 
It is thus useful to make a more detailed study of the phase diagram of the model synapse as well as the dynamic
trajectories as various phase boundaries are approached
