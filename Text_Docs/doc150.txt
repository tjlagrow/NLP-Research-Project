Abstract The evolution of galaxies is driven strongly by dynamical
processes including internal instabilities tidal interactions and mergers
The cluster environment is a useful laboratory for studying these eects
I present recent results on simulations of interacting populations of spiral
and elliptical galaxies in the cosmological collapse of a cluster showing the
formation of the central brightest cluster galaxies through merging the
eect of tidal interactions and merging on galaxy morphology over cosmic
history and the distribution and kinematics of the tidal debris eld See

Introduction
In most cosmological scenarios galaxies form early and rapidly in the collapse
of density perturbations but continue to evolve over a Hubble time both in lu-
minosity and morphology The ageing of the galaxy stellar population leads
to a gradual dimming of their light a signal that is now picked up in distant
spirals and elliptical galaxies eg Vogt et al 1996 Kelson et al 1997 Dy-
namics primarily drives the galaxy morphological evolution through 1 internal
gravitational instabilities such as the bar instability which may inuence bulge
formation 2 tidal interactions which can explain much of the disturbed and
irregular morphology of galaxies at high z eg Oemler et al 1997 3 the
merging of disks to form some or most of the ellipticals Toomre 1977 Merging
obviously contributes to evolution of the galaxy luminosity function
Galaxy clusters are the best place to investigate the connection between
dynamics and morphology because they contain a diverse population of galaxies
that have interacted strongly many times over their lifetime Dressler 1984 has
aptly described clusters as laboratories of galaxy formation in particular in the
way they emphasize the importance of gravitational interactions Here I explic-
itly follow that lead by setting up numerical experiments of galaxy interactions
in cosmological clusters
The simulation of galaxy dynamics in a cosmological context at sucient
resolution to resolve detailed dynamical eects is now becoming feasible Kilo-
parsec scales can now be resolved in the volume surrounding a collapsing cluster
Most aspects of the dynamical evolution of galaxies do not require the compli-
cated details of dissipative galaxy formation so there is no need for expensive
hydro calculations
A simple technique that allows studies of galaxy dynamics in clusters works
as follows First a cosmological N-body simulation in a large volume is run and
a cluster size dark halo is identied at z  0 The simulation is re-examined
at early times z  3 to 2 and all dark halos that will end up in the cluster
are replaced with N-body models of disk and possibly elliptical galaxies scaled
according the mass and circular velocity of the halos with at least 10 the res-
olution The rationale is that galactic disks should form rapidly prior to cluster
collapse and the bulk of their dynamical evolution will be driven by the interac-
tions they experience when they fall into the collapsing cluster Simulations are
then continued with the resolved galaxy models to z  0
So far I have applied this technique in 2 simulations the rst with a poor
cluster   550 kms containing 100 well-resolved disk galaxies inserted at
z  2 Dubinski 1998 and a Virgo-scale cluster   800 kms with 200 disks
and 15 ellipticals inserted at z  3 The main results of these simulations are
discussed below
2 Brightest Cluster Galaxies
Most clusters have a giant elliptical or cD galaxy near their spatial and kinematic
center
They are generically known as brightest cluster galaxies or BCGs
There have been various theories put forward for the origin of these galaxy
giants including star formation in X-ray cooling ows Fabian 1994 galactic
cannibalism and tidal destruction of small galaxies Richstone 1976 Ostriker 
Tremaine 1975 and early galaxy merging during the collapse of cluster core in
hierarchical structure formation Merritt 1985 There is little evidence of young
stars in BCGs which refutes the cooling ow idea and galactic cannibalism can
only account for a small fraction of the luminosity of a BCG since merging is
inecient in virialized clusters  galaxies are moving fast and tidally truncated
so dynamical friction timescales are too long to allow much merging
The idea that seems to work the best is rapid galaxy merging in a cos-
mological hierarchy and has recently been illustrated by Dubinski 1998 in a
simulation of a poor cluster The 7 most massive galaxies in the collapsing
cluster merge rapidly forming a BCG by z  10 building up the bulk of its
luminosity The BCG accretes a further 6 dwarf galaxies vc  100 kms but
they do not add much extra mass The structure and kinematics of the resulting
simulated BCG agree quantitatively with real ones cf Fisher et al 1995 with
de Vaucouleurs light proles re  20 kpc and central velocity dispersions in
the right range   350 kms Furthermore the BCG displays the alignment
eect its long axis is closely aligned with the long axis of the galaxy distribution
Sastry 1968 Carter  Metcalfe 1980 This can be traced back to the collapse
of the cluster along the lament present in the cosmological initial conditions
supporting conjectures that BCGs show alignment correlations with large-scale
structure Binggeli 1982
3 Strong Tidal Interactions and Merging
Moore et al 1996 have pointed out that strong tidal interactions or galaxy
harassment in the cluster environment play an important role in galaxy mor-
phological evolution In the simulations discussed here most galaxies show signs
of tidal disturbance over their history Some major eects are the excitation of
open spiral structures warps and even tidal tails in close encounters of individ-
ual galaxies with the growing central BCG Many galaxies are on orbits that
take them within 100 kpc of the cluster center and the tidal elds within this
radius are sucient to obviously distort galaxies
Isolated disturbed galaxies
seen in clusters may result in high speed encounters with the parent clusters
central potential Higher resolution simulations of individual disks in orbit in
xed cluster potentials clearly demonstrate this eect Dubinski  Hayes 1999
Tidal heating of disks can be strong in this environment and could account
in part for the greater frequency of S0 galaxies in clusters as revealed by the
morphology-density eect Dressler 1980
Galaxy-galaxy interactions also create disturbed galaxies but this occurs
mainly in bound pairs or groups which eventually merge forming elliptical-like
remnants It appears that the general origin of elliptical galaxies in the cluster
environment is the merging of sub-groups in the hierarchy Moore et al 1998
claim that galaxy harassment may also produce dwarf elliptical galaxies but
to be denitive higher resolution is needed since numerical heating eects can
be severe when simulating galaxies over a Hubble time even when using 100K
particles All of this work needs to be placed on a stronger statistical foundation
with more simulations and better resolution
Intergalactic Tidal Debris
Cluster tides are quite eective at stripping stars from galaxies and building
up an intergalactic stellar population and potentially account for the envelopes
of the cD galaxies Richstone 1976 Merritt 1985 The recent discovery of
intergalactic stars in the Virgo and Fornax clusters in the form of planetary
nebulae and red giant-branch stars Theuns  Warren 1996 Arnaboldi et al
1996 Feldmeier et al 1998 Ferguson et al 1998 along with the likelihood
of intergalactic globular clusters have revived interest in the dynamics of the
tidal-stripping process
Analysis of the poor cluster simulation shows that about 10 of the stars are
distributed diusely throughout the cluster with surface brightness dimmer than
  265 assuming an ML  5 Dubinski Murali  Ouyed 1999 The radial
light distribution is approximately a continuation of a deVaucouleurs prole out
to r  1 Mpc from the center of the BCG The Virgo-cluster simulation shows
similar results and there is the hint of a cD envelope
There are also a signicant number of streams and swathes of stars in the
intracluster light that originate in stripping events of spirals and ellipticals
These streams often trace the orbits of galaxies on radial orbits that have suered
a strong tidal encounter with the cluster center Examples of streams just
forming in tidal encounters have recently been detected in the Coma cluster
Gregg and West 1998 Streams may be dicult to detect directly because of
their low surface brightness However the contrast may increase when viewed
in the r  vlos phase-plane A kinematic survey of several hundred planetary
nebulae and globular clusters in the intergalactic space surrounding M87 in
Virgo or NGC 1399 in Fornax may reveal coherent streams on top of a diuse
population New analysis shows how the kinematics of the tidal debris streams
present a new way to measure the gravitational potential of nearby clusters
Dubinski et al 1999
5 Conclusions
The simulations described here provide a detailed quantitative way of probing
the dynamical evolution of galaxies in clusters Future work will concentrate
on producing a simulated survey of clusters covering a wide mass range in dif-
ferent cosmological models to improve statistics on the BCGs and the elliptical
population along with general eects of tidal interactions on galaxy morphology
over cosmic history In principle these eects depend strongly on the cosmolog-
ical model so detailed comparison with the observations will provide interesting
constraints and consistency checks on these models
