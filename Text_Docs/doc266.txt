Abstract We present a new model for the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies
taking into account SN feedback detailed nucleosynthesis and galactic winds We
discuss the eect of galactic winds on the chemical enrichment of the ICM and
compute the energy per particle injected by the galaxies into the ICM

1 The chemical evolution model for Ellipticals
We present the results obtained with a new chemical evolution model
for ellipticals based on the multi-zone model by Martinelli et al 1998
with improved SN feedback and dierent prescriptions for the stellar
nucleosynthesis see Pipino et al 2002 This model can be applied
to infer the age for a single galaxy as MS1512-cB58 see Matteucci 
Pipino 2002 to test dierent scenarios for galaxy formation ie mono-
lithic versus hierarchical and to predict the evolution of the chemical
abundances and the energy per particle released by elliptical galaxies
through galactic winds into the ICM
11 Galactic models
We adopt two dierent recipes for SNIa and SNII respectively For SNII
we assume that the evolution of the energy in the snowplow phase is
regulated by Cio McKee  Bertschinger 1988 cooling time for
a detailed discussion see Pipino et al 2002 This cooling time takes
into account the eect of metallicity and therefore can model in a
self-consistent way the evolution of a SNR in the ISM
On the other hand following Recchi et al 2001 we assume that
SNIa which explode in a medium already heated by SNII contribute
with the total amount of their energy budget without radiative losses
In this way we obtain a total ie SNIaII mean eciency of energy
release by SN to the ISM of  20 for our best model and derive
a maximum possible eciency in order to have realistic models of
about  35 
We study the eects of two dierent sets of stellar yields on the
enrichment of the ICM a For low and intermediate mass stars 08

Nomoto et al 1997 for SNIa
Here we present the results obtained with our best model a multi-
zone model with Salpeter IMF and the choice a for stellar yields The
adopted cosmology is m  03   07 and Ho  70 km s1 Mpc1
and the galaxies form at zf  8 In order to check our results we com-
pared our prediction for the Fe enrichment of the ICM with predictions
from models with dierent prescriptions see Pipino et al 2002 Our
models assume increasing eciency of SF with galactic mass which
makes larger galaxies undergo galactic wind before the smaller ones
This implies shorter star-formation timescales for more massive galaxies
and allows us to reproduce the increasing trend of MgFe with galactic
mass Matteucci 1994
12 The age of the galaxy MS1512-cB58
We can constrain the age of the Lyman break galaxy MS1512-cB58
showing that its chemical properties are consistent with those of an
elliptical galaxy or a bulge in the early phases of its life Matteucci 
Pipino 2002 In particular we nd that this age should be  30M yr
by comparing our model predictions on the chemical abundances with
the observations of Pettini et al 2002 In the rst gure we show
the prediction for XFe vs time left panel assuming that roughly
half of the iron is hidden in dust grains compared to the observations
showed as horizontal lines with their errors The right panel allows
us to make a stronger conclusion on the age because neither O nor N
are dust depleted
2 Evolution of abundances and energy in the ICM
To compute the total masses of the chemical elements gas and total
thermal energy ejected into the ICM by the cluster galaxies we inte-
grate the contributions from the single galaxies over the cluster K-band
luminosity function at each given cosmic time for clusters of dierent
mass temperature For the equations and related details we direct the
reader to Pipino et al 2002
In gure 2 we show the Fe abundance in the ICM predicted by our
models compared to the observed one by White 2000 as functions of

IMF and evolution of Spirals is shown by the long dashed
line We have also computed the amount of metals which remains
locked up inside stars We found that the Fe in the ICM should be
5 times more than the Fe in stars whereas O and the global metal
content should be roughly the same inside stars and in the ICM

The best model can also reproduce the observed Fe ratios in
the ICM In particular there is good agreement between the predicted
 solar and observed  01  01dex SiFe ratios whereas the
predicted OFe ratios are lower  03dex than the solar value
as indicated by some observations eg Ishimaru  Arimoto 1997
However the O measurements in the ICM are still very sparse and
uncertain and more data are required to assess this point but see
Gastaldello  Molendi 2002
Models with the choice b for the stellar yields from massive stars
predict the same amount of Fe and energy in the ICM whereas the
dierences in the predictions for Fe ratios are less than  02dex
On the right-hand side of gure 2 we show the predicted evolution
of the energy per particle in the ICM Epp upper panel and the iron
mass in the ICM lower panel as a function of redshift by the best
model Little evolution is found both for the abundances and for the
heating energy from z0 up to z1 in agreement with observations

3 Conclusions
While type II SNe dominate the chemical evolution of the ellipticals
creating  enhancement  type Ia SNe play a fundamental role in
providing energy  80  95 and Fe  45  80 into the ICM
Comparing masses and energy ejected by galaxies formed at z  8
with those from galaxies formed at z  3 leads to the conclusion that
the bulk of the ejection has to take place at 3  z  5
The best model which reproduces the Fe abundances in the ICM
can provide 020-035 keV of energy per ICM particle depending on
the cluster richness
