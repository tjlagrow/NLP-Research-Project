Abstract
Using the GaussianSchechter composite luminosity functions measured from the ESO-Sculptor Survey
de Lapparent et al 2003 and assuming that these functions do not evolve with redshift out to z  1 we
obtain evidence for evolution in the late spectral class containing late-type Spiral ScSd and dwarf Irregular
dI galaxies There are indications that the ScSd galaxies are the evolving population but we cannot exclude
that the dI galaxies also undergo some evolution This evolution is detected as an increase of the ScSdIm
galaxy density which can be modeled as either nz  1  3z  015 or nz  1  z2 using the currently
favored cosmological parameters m  03 and   07 the uncertainty in the linear and power-law evolution
rates is of order of unity For m  10 and   00 the linear and power-law evolution rates are  4  1 and
 25  1 respectively Both models yield a good match to the ESS BV Rc redshift distributions to 21  22mag and
to the number-counts to 23  235mag which probe the galaxy distribution to redshifts z  05 and z  10
respectively
The present analysis shows the usefulness of the joint use of the magnitude and redshift distributions for studying
galaxy evolution It also illustrates how GaussianSchechter composite luminosity functions provide more robust
constraints on the evolution rate than pure Schechter luminosity functions thus emphasizing the importance of
performing realistic parameterizations of the luminosity functions for studying galaxy evolution
The detected density evolution indicates that mergers could play a signicant role in the evolution of late-type
Spiral and dwarf Irregular galaxies However the ESO-Sculptor density increase with redshift could also be
caused by a  1mag brightening of the ScSddI galaxies at z  05 and a  15  20mag brightening at
z  1 which is compatible with the expected passive brightening of Sc galaxies at these redshifts Distinguishing
between luminosity and density evolution is a major diculty as these produce the same eect on the redshift
and magnitude distributions The detected evolution rate of the ESO-Sculptor ScSddI galaxies is nevertheless
among the range of measured values from the other existing analyses whether they provide evidence for density
or luminosity evolution

Here we report on yet another evidence for evolu-
tion of the late-type galaxies derived from the ESO-
Sculptor Survey ESS hereafter The ESS provides a
nearly complete redshift survey of galaxies at z  05
over a contiguous area of the sky A reliable description
of galaxy evolution require proper identication of the
evolving galaxy populations and detailed knowledge of
their luminosity functions In this context the ESS sam-
ple has the advantage to be split into 3 galaxy classes
which are based on a template-free spectral classica-
tion Galaz  de Lapparent 1998 and which are domi-
nated by the giant morphological types ES0Sa SbSc
and ScSdSm respectively de Lapparent et al 2003
Paper I hereafter In Paper I we have performed a de-
tailed measurement of the shape of the luminosity func-
tions LF hereafter for the 3 ESS spectral classes The
spectral-type LFs show marked dierences among the
classes which are common to the B V  Rc bands and
thus indicate that they measure physical properties of the
underlying galaxy populations
The analysis of the ESS LFs in Paper I also pro-
vides a revival of the view advocated by Binggeli et al
1988 a galaxy LF is the weighted sum of the intrinsic
LFs for each morphological type contained in the con-
sidered galaxy sample in this picture dierences in LFs
mark variations in the galaxy mix rather than variations
in the intrinsic LFs Dressler 1980 Postman  Geller
1984 Binggeli et al 1990 Ferguson  Sandage 1991
Trentham  Hodgkin 2002 Trentham  Tully 2002
Local measures show that giant galaxies Elliptical
Lenticular and Spiral have Gaussian LFs which are
thus bounded at both bright and faint magnitudes
with the Elliptical LF skewed towards faint magnitudes
Sandage et al 1985 Jerjen  Tammann 1997 In con-
trast the LF for dwarf Spheroidal galaxies may be ever
increasing at faint magnitudes to the limit of the existing
surveys Sandage et al 1985 Ferguson  Sandage 1991
Jerjen et al 2000 Flint et al 2001ba Conselice et al
2002 whereas the LF for dwarf Irregular galaxies is at-
ter Pritchet  van den Bergh 1999 and may even be
bounded at faint magnitudes Ferguson  Sandage 1989
Jerjen  Tammann 1997 Jerjen et al 2000 In Paper I
by tting the ESS spectral-type LFs with composite func-
tions based on the Gaussian and Schechter LFs measured
for each morphological type in local galaxy groups and
clusters Sandage et al 1985 Jerjen  Tammann 1997
we conrm the morphological content in giant galaxies of
the ESS classes and we detect an additional contribution
from dwarf Spheroidal dE and dwarf Irregular galaxies
dI in the intermediate-type and late-type classes respec-
tively We then suggest that by providing a good match
to the ESS spectral-type LFs the local intrinsic LFs may
extend to z  05 with only small variations
In the following we report on the measurement of the
amplitude of the LFs for the 3 ESS spectral-type LFs and
on the detection and measurement of redshift evolution for
the late-type galaxies Sect 2 lists the main characteris-
tics of the ESS spectroscopic survey Sect 3 recalls the
denition of the ESS spectral classes and the technique
for deriving the corresponding K-corrections and absolute
magnitudes Sect 4 shows the measured composite ts of
the ESS LFs for the 3 spectral classes In Sect 5 we de-
scribe the various techniques for measuring the amplitude
of the LF Sect 51 and the associated errors Sect 52
we then apply these techniques to the ESS and show the
detected evolution in the late-type galaxies Sect 53 In
Sect 6 we use the ESS magnitude number-counts to de-
rive improved estimate of the late-type galaxy evolution
rate in the B V  and Rc bands We then examine in Sect 7
the redshift distributions for the 3 spectral classes in the
3 lters and we verify that the measured evolution rates
for the late-type galaxies match the ESS expected redshift
distributions Then in Sect 8 we compare the detected
evolution in the ESS LF with those derived from other ex-
isting redshift surveys which detect either number density
evolution Sect 81 or luminosity evolution Sect 82
Finally Sect 9 summarizes the results discusses them in
view of the other analyses which detect evolution in the
late-type galaxies and raises some of the prospects
2 The ESS spectroscopic survey
The ESO-Sculptor Survey ESS hereafter provides a com-
plete photometric and spectroscopic survey of galaxies in
a region centered at  0h22m RA  3006 DEC
near the Southern Galactic Pole The photometric sur-
vey provides standard magnitudes B V  and Rc in the
Johnson-Cousins system for nearly 13000 galaxies to V 
24 over a contiguous rectangular area of  037 deg2
153RA  024DEC Arnouts et al 1997 The
uncertainties in the apparent magnitudes are 005mag in
the B V and Rc bands for Rc  210 Arnouts et al
1997 Multi-slit spectroscopy of the  600 galaxies with
Rc  205 Bellanger et al 1995 have provided a 92
complete redshift survey over a contiguous sub-area of
 025 deg2 102RA  024DEC Additional red-
shifts for  250 galaxies with 205  Rc  215 were
also measured in the same sub-area leading to a 52 red-
shift completeness to Rc  215 see Paper I for details
We also consider here the V  210 and B  220 red-
shifts samples which correspond to the combination of
the Rc  205 nominal limit with the typical colors of
galaxies at that limit B  Rc  15 and V  Rc  05

Arnouts et al 1997 The redshift completeness for the
V  210 and B  220 samples is 91 and 86 respec-
tively
3 Spectral classication and K-corrections
Estimates of morphological types are not available for the
ESS redshift survey In Paper I we estimate the ESS
intrinsic LFs based on a spectral classication Using a
Principal Component Analysis we have derived an ob-
jective spectral sequence which is parameterized continu-
ously using 2 parameters describing respectively the rela-
tive fractions of old to young stellar populations param-
eter denoted here TS and the relative strength of the
emission lines Galaz  de Lapparent 1998
The ESS spectral sequence is separated into 3 classes
denoted early-type intermediate-type and late-
type which correspond to TS  5 5  TS  3
and TS  3 respectively These values separate the ESS
spectroscopic Rc V  and B samples into sub-samples with
as least 100 galaxies see Table 1 Given the moderate
number of objects in the ESS spectroscopic sample these
3 classes thus provide a satisfying compromise between
resolution in spectral-type and signal-to-noise in the cor-
responding LFs
Projection of the Kennicutt 1992 spectra onto the
ESS spectral sequence shows that a tight correspondence
with the Hubble morphological sequence of normal galax-
ies Galaz  de Lapparent 1998 Paper I the ESS early-
type class contains predominantly E S0 and Sa galax-
ies the intermediate-type class Sb and Sc galaxies and
the late-type class Sc Sd and SmIm galaxies We show
that these spectral classes allow us to detect the respec-
tive contributions to the LF from the Elliptical Lenticular
and Spiral galaxies and from the dwarf Spheroidal and
Irregular galaxies
In Paper I we estimate the K-correction for the ESS
by projecting templates extracted from the PEGASE1
spectrophotometric model of galaxy evolution onto the
ESS spectral sequence A ne mesh of model spectra with
varying redshift and spectral-type are generated and K-
corrections in the B V  and Rc lters are calculated for
each of them because the model spectra extend from 2000
A to 10000 A we can derive K-corrections in the 3 bands
up to z  06 the eective depth of the ESS redshift sur-
vey A 2-D polynomial t to the resulting surface in each
lter provides analytical formul for the K-corrections
as a function of redshift and spectral type which are
used for the ESS galaxies these are plotted in Fig 9 be-
low where they are compared with the K-corrections by
Coleman et al 1980 see Paper I for further details and
comparisons For each galaxy the absolute magnitude M
is then derived from the apparent magnitude m the spec-
tral type TS and the redshift z using
M m z TS  m  5 log dLz  Kz TS  25

Throughout the present analysis absolute magnitudes are
calculated with a Hubble constant at present epoch writ-
ten as H0  100h km s1 Mpc1 We also assume a at
Universe with values of the dimensionless matter den-
sity and cosmological constant assigned to m  03

considered see Sects 4 and 6
In Paper I we report on all sources of random and sys-
tematic errors which aect the spectral classication the
K-corrections and the absolute magnitudes By compar-
ison of the 228 pairs of independent spectra we measure
external errors in the K-corrections from 007 to 021
mag and resulting uncertainties in the absolute magni-
tudes from 009 to 024mag with larger errors in bluer
bands for both the K-corrections and the absolute mag-
nitudes From the 228 pairs of spectra we also mea-
sure an external rms uncertainty in the redshifts of
  000055 which causes negligeable uncertainty in the
absolute magnitudes compared to the other sources of er-
4 The shape of the ESS luminosity functions
The shape of the LFs for the 3 ESS spectral classes are
derived in Paper I using both the non-parametric step-
wise maximum likelihood method SWML developed by
Efstathiou et al 1988 and the method of Sandage et al
1979 denote STY which assumes a specic parametric
form for the LF Although pure Schechter 1976 functions
provide acceptable STY ts to the 3 ESS spectral-classes
we show that as good or better STY ts of the Rc LFs are
obtained using composite functions based on the intrinsic
LFs per morphological type measured in local groups and
clusters Jerjen  Tammann 1997 Sandage et al 1985
For the ESS intermediate-type and late-type Rc LFs
we t the sum of a Gaussian component representing the
giant galaxies SbSc and ScSd resp and a Schechter
component representing the dwarf galaxies dSph and dI
resp The Gaussian component is parameterized as
M  dM  0eM0M222
where M0 and  are the peak and rms dispersion respec-
tively The Schechter 1976 component is parameterized

becomes
M  dM  04 ln 10 eX X 1 dM
L  10 04 M M
where M  is the characteristic magnitude and   1 the
faint-end slope
For the ESS early-type Rc LF a two-wing Gaussian
function is used a Gaussian with two dierent dispersion
wings at the bright and faint end as it successfully re-
ects the combination of a skewed LF towards faint magni-
tudes for the Elliptical galaxies with a Gaussian LF for the
Lenticular galaxies displaced towards brighter magnitudes
and with a narrower dispersion The two-wing Gaussian
is parameterized as
M  dM  0eM0M222
 0eM0M222
a dM for M  M0
b dM for M  M0
where M0 is the peak magnitude and a and b are the
dispersion values for the 2 wings The improvement of the
composite LFs over pure Schechter LFs is most marked for
the early-type LF because of its bounded behavior at faint
magnitudes which is better adjusted by a Gaussian than a
Schechter function and for the late-type LF which cannot
be tted by a single Schechter function at simultaneously
faint and intermediate magnitudes
The ESS Rc LFs are measured for both the Rc  205
and Rc  215 samples in Paper I Here we choose to use
the LFs measured from the deeper sample because the
faint-end of the LF is better dened than from the shal-
lower sample Composite ts to the LFs for the V  210
and B  220 samples have not been performed in Paper I
Here we however need these ts in order to use the con-
straints on galaxy evolution provided by the V and B faint
number counts Instead of performing the STY composite
ts in the V and B bands which requires particular care
because of the number of parameters involved we prefer to
use the simpler approach of converting the Rc LF param-
eters into the V and B bands We showed in Paper I that
the shift in magnitude of the V and B LFs with respect to
the Rc is close to the mean V Rc BRc resp color of the
galaxies in the considered spectral class Moreover the se-
lection biases aecting the V and B samples a deciency
in galaxies bluer than B  Rc  15 and V  Rc  05
resp due to the selection of the spectroscopic sample in
the Rc band aect the faint-end of the late-type LF when
tted by pure Schechter functions making it atter than
in the Rc band Conversion of the composite Rc LF into
the B and V bands allow us to circumvent the problem of
incompleteness in the B and V bands
Figure 1 plots the LFs for the 3 galaxy types in
the Rc  215 V  210 and B  220 samples
The points represent the SWML solutions derived with
m 1000 in Paper I For the Rc  215 sample

Paper I note that for the late-type LF we have adopted
the intermediate slope   03 between the values
  08 and   039 measured from the Rc  205 and
Rc  215 samples a slope   03 is also measured for
SmIm galaxies in the Virgo cluster Jerjen  Tammann
1997 The parameters for the V and B composite LFs
middle and right panels resp of Fig 1 are then de-
rived from those for the Rc  215 sample by applying

the mean M V   M Rc and M B  M Rc colors for
each spectral class we use the Rc  205 sample for the
color estimation rather than the Rc  215 sample as
the completeness at magnitudes fainter Rc  205 is bi-
ased in favor of red objects The colors are those listed
in Table 4 of Paper I M V   M Rc  05 04 04 and
M V M Rc  14 10 08 for early-type intermediate-
type and late-type galaxies respectively
Note that the SWML points in Fig 1 account for the
incompleteness per apparent magnitude interval as de-
scribed by Zucca et al 1994 For the SWML points a
bin size of M  048mag is used in all lters smaller
or larger bin sizes within a factor 2 yield similar curves
As the amplitudes of the composite ts and the SWML
solutions in the Fig 1 are so far undetermined they are
measured later on in Sects 5 and 6 we adopt the follow-
ing we use the same normalization of the SWML curves
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
as used in Paper I see Table 3 using the amplitude 
measured from the pure Schechter ts then for each sam-
ple the composite is adjusted by least-square t to the
SWML points with the ratio 004 ln 10  between the
Gaussian and Schechter component kept xed to the val-
ues in Table 1
Figure 1 shows that the composite LFs provide good
adjustment to the SWML solutions for each of the 3 spec-
tral classes in each lter In particular the simple color
shift used to dene the composite LFs in the V and B
bands provides good adjustments to the SWML points in
both bands despite the color biases aecting the redshift
completeness of these samples Note that the composite
spectral-type LFs derived from the Rc  215 sample pro-
vide satisfying adjustment to the SWML points for the
Rc  205 spectral-type samples
In Paper I the LFs are measured for cosmologi-
cal parameters m  10 and   00 Because the
faint number counts which we use below to constrain
the ESS evolution rate are sensitive to the cosmologi-
cal parameters we have converted these values to m 
03 and   07 the currently favored parameters
Riess et al 1998 Perlmutter et al 1999 Phillips et al
2001 Tonry et al 2003 Again rather than re-running
the composite ts we apply the empirical corrections de-
rived by de Lapparent 2003 as follows When changing
from m 0307 to m 1000 the vari-
ation in absolute magnitude due to the change in luminos-
ity distance is M  03mag at z  03 the peak redshift
of the ESS see Figs 13-15 This empirical correction
is conrmed by the results from Fried et al 2001 and
Blanton et al 2001 who calculate galaxy LFs in both
cosmologies de Lapparent 2003 also apply a correction
to the Schechter parameter  with   M3 due to
the strong correlation between the M  and  parame-
ters in a Schechter parameterization Here we neglect this
correction which would amount to   01 for a pure
Schechter parameterization this value is comparable or
smaller than the 1- uncertainty in the faint-end slope
 of the Schechter component for the ESS intermediate-
type and late-type LFs and than the 1- uncertainty in
the dispersion a and b of the 2-wing Gaussian tted to
the ESS early-type LF see Table 1
Table 1 lists the resulting LF shape parameters for the
Gaussian and Schechter components M0 a b M  
for a symmetric Gaussian  is listed in the a column
conversion to m0307 is obtained by shifting
all values of M0 and M  by 03mag The last column of
Table 1 lists the ratio of amplitude 004 ln 10  between
the Gaussian and Schechter component derived from the
composite ts to the Rc  215 sample in Paper I We
adopt the same values of this ratio for the V and B LFs
5 The amplitude of the ESS luminosity functions
The amplitude of the LF is proportional to the mean den-
sity of galaxies brighter than some absolute magnitude
threshold It is therefore a useful indicator of the large-
Fig 2 Absolute Rc magnitudes as a function of redshift z
for the ESS galaxies with Rc  215 using H0  100h km
s1 Mpc1 m  03 and   07 This graph shows
how the apparent limiting magnitude biases the range of
absolute magnitudes detected at increasing redshift and
how the varying K-corrections per spectral type aect the
faintest absolute magnitude reached at a given redshift
scale variations in the luminous component of the matter
density in the Universe and its possible evolution with
redshift
Several other redshift surveys probing the same red-
shift range as the ESS survey 01  z  05 have de-
tected signs of evolution in the intrinsic galaxy LFs see
Sect 8 below The major diculty in measuring evolution
of the LF with redshift originates from the limit in appar-
ent magnitude which aects most redshift surveys The
ux limit results in the detection of galaxies in an absolute
magnitude range which narrows with increasing redshift
to the brightest galaxies Figure 2 shows how the absolute
magnitudes of the faintest detected ESS galaxies is a func-
tion of redshift and spectral-type via the K-correction
the limiting curve at faint magnitudes is dened by replac-
ing in Eq 1 the apparent magnitude m with the Rc  215
magnitude limit and the K-correction KTS z with the
smallest value over the considered spectral class at each
z Faint galaxies 18  5 log h  MRc  15  5 log h
are exclusively detected at z  02 in the ESS whereas
only bright early-type and intermediate-type galaxies with
M Rc  210  5 log h and bright late-type galaxies
with M Rc  200  5 log h are detected at z  05
In the full ESS redshift range 01  z  05 only galax-
ies in the magnitude interval 220  5 log h  MRc
210  5 log h can be observed which is clearly too nar-
row for deriving any constraint on the evolution in the

shape of the LF Figures 3 and 4 which show the abso-
lute V and B magnitudes versus redshift for the 3 spectral
classes in the V  210 and B  220 samples resp dis-
play similar eects Driver 2001 showed that these biases
strongly aect the usual tests for galaxy evolution based
on the shape of the LF
The other limitation for detecting redshift evolution
in the ESS is the limited statistics separation of each of
the 3 spectral classes into even as few as 2 redshifts inter-
vals would yield large uncertainties in the measured shape
of the LFs which would make insignicant any reason-
able dierence between the high and low redshift LFs For
the ESS we can only examine whether the general LF
ie the LF summed over all ESS spectral types evolves
with redshift Here we consider the LF at Rc  205
as varying incompleteness at fainter magnitudes may act
as evolution For m   10 00 the ESS general
LF for Rc  205 can be tted by a Schechter function
with M   2095  012  5 log h and   115  009
STY t The corresponding LF in the redshift interval
z  03 at Rc  205 has M   2117 021  5 log h and
  118 011 at z  03 M   2117 028  5 log h
and   163  031 The values of M  are identi-
cal in the 2 redshift ranges and the slope  diers by
14-sigma using m 0307 yields similar conclu-
sions Given the diculty in determining the parameter
 in a Schechter t Paper I these results are consistent
with the hypothesis of null evolution in the shape of the
ESS Rc general LF in the redshift range 01  z  05
This is however no proof that the individual spectral-type
LFs do not vary in shape one could imagine redshift vari-
ations in the shape of the intrinsic LFs which would con-
spire to combine into a constant general LF
Driver 2001 did suggest that reliable constraints on
evolution of the shape of the galaxy LF at z  125
may only be derived from samples as deep as the Hubble
Deep Field Williams et al 1996 which reaches z  35
Sawicki et al 1997 Driver 2001 recommends that such
analyses be rather based on the bi-variate brightness dis-
tribution for galaxies the function which describes the
galaxy bi-variate distribution in absolute magnitude and
mean surface brightness To circumvent the diculty in
measuring evolution in the shape of the LF we assume in
the following that the shape of the intrinsic LFs for the
ESS early-type intermediate-type and late-type galaxies
as listed in Table 1 is not evolving with redshift Any
possible evolution will then be detected as evolution in
the amplitude of the LF

function
Once the shape of the LF is determined its amplitude

therefore requires to correct the observed number of galax-
ies to the expected number if the survey was limited to the
constant absolute magnitude interval M1  M  M2 The
correction is obtained by multiplying the observed num-
ber of galaxies at redshift z by the inverse of the selection
function Sz dened as
M  dM
maxMbrightzM1 M  dM
Sz  R minMfaintzM2
For the ESS we take in all lters M1  30  5 log h and
M2  16  5 log h see Figs 2-4 Sz then measures
the fraction of galaxies with M1  M  M2 at redshift z
which are included in the survey
Following Davis  Huchra 1982 we dene 3 estima-
tors for the mean density n M1  M  M2 which
are unbiased by the apparent magnitude limit of the
survey in the following although we omit to mention
M1  M  M2 all quoted densities refer to that interval
If N z dz is the observed number of galaxies in a shell
dz at redshift z N z dzSz is the expected number
of galaxies with M1  M  M2 A rst estimator of the
mean density is dened by Davis  Huchra 1982 as
n1zmax 
V zmin zmaxZ zmax
where zmin and zmax are arbitrary choices of the small-
est and largest redshift over which the integrals are per-
formed and V zmin zmax is the total volume of the survey
between these limits
V zmin zmax Z zmax
dV is the comoving volume element at redshift z see
Eq 25 Here we use zmin  01 see Sect 53 Note that
because 1Sz rises sharply with redshift the n1 esti-
mator heavily weights distant structures Davis  Huchra
1982 also showed that n1 is close to the minimum vari-
ance estimator of the mean density
Davis  Huchra 1982 dene another estimator by
equating the observed number of galaxies with the ex-
pected number in a homogeneous universe
n3zmax  R zmax
N z dz
Sz dV
This estimator is much more stable than n1 as all ob-
served galaxies are weighted equally It however heavily
weights galaxies near the peak of the redshift distribution
Davis  Huchra 1982
Finally Davis  Huchra 1982 dene a third and in-
termediate estimator by averaging the expected density
across radial shells
zmax  zmin Z zmax
Sz dV
n2zmax 
The interest of the n2 estimator is that its dierential
Sz dV
can also be calculated as a function of redshift and al-
lows one to examine the variations of the local galaxy
density with redshift Note that the 3 estimators n1 n2
and n3 can be calculated to a varying depth zmax and are
thus dened as functions of zmax In a fair sample of the
galaxy distribution that is a sample which is signicantly
larger than the largest density uctuations all 3 estima-
tors should converge to a common value as zmax reaches
the sample depth
A fourth estimator which we test here is that pro-
posed by Efstathiou et al 1988 This estimator is simi-
lar to n1 but the shell dz is taken to be innitely small so
that galaxies can be counted one by one and the integral
can be re-written as a sum over the galaxies in the sample
nEEPzmax 
V zmin zmax
where zi is the redshift of each galaxy Ngal galaxies are
observed in the redshift range zmin zmax and the volume
V zmin zmax is dened in Eq 11
The variations with zmax of the estimators 1 2 3
and EEP based on n1zmax n2zmax n3zmax and
nEEPzmax respectively can then be dened using Eq 8
In practise the integrals in the n1 n2 and n3 estima-
tors are calculated as discrete sums over a nite redshift
bin z and the selection function correction is approxi-
mated as Szc where zc is the central redshift of the bin
However because the second derivative of the selection
function is positive this yields an underestimate of the
expected number of galaxies The resulting systematic er-
ror in  is  1 It is reduced to  01 by replacing
Szc by its average value over the bin which we adopt
for the n1 n2 and n3 estimators The nEEP estimator is
a priori unbiased by this eect as galaxies are considered
one by one and Sz is calculated at the redshift of each
galaxy Our tests with mock ESS catalogues described
in the next Sect however show that the nEEP estimator
tends to over-estimate the true  by  1 for uniform
distributions with  200 points this bias disappears for
distributions with more than  2000 points In the ESS
spectral classes for which Ngal  100  300 galaxies a
 1 bias is small compared to the random uncertainties
in the n1 n2 and n3 estimators see next Sect
52 Estimation of errors
We estimate the random errors in the amplitude of the
LFs for the ESS by generating mock ESS distributions
with  240  2400 and  24 000 points and a Schechter
LF dened by M   192 and   14 using com-
posite LFs as those listed in Table 1 would not change
any of the reported results the measured values of 
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
are then in proportion of the total number of galaxies in
each simulation The mock distributions have no built-in
clustering and are thus uniform spatial distributions mod-
ulated by the selection function see Eq 9 To neverthe-
less take into account the eects of large-scale clustering
we also introduce in the simulations density uctuations
in redshift which mimic large-scale structure uctuations
resembling those measured in the ESS measured as the
departure from the redshift distribution for a uniform dis-
tribution and various transformations of these including
the inverse of the ESS uctuations We neglect density
uctuations transverse to the line-of-sight as they are ex-
pected to have a negligeable eect on the calculation of
the mean density
For each type of simulation choice of  and uctua-
tions in density we generate 100 samples with dierent
seeds for the random generators The random errors in the
various estimators of  are then calculated directly from
the variance among the 100 realizations of the same distri-
bution and are functions of the redshift zmax out to which
Eq 1013 are integrated We measure that the variance
in the estimator 3 of  based on n3 varies as
3
3 
pNgalzmin zmax
where Ngalzmin zmax is the number of galaxies in the
survey which lie in the redshift interval zmin zmax This
is valid out to the most distant galaxy included in the
survey For the n2 estimator of  we measure
pNgalzmin zmax
2
2 
This is also valid out to the redshift where Ngal cor-
responds  95 of the total number of galaxies in
the sample z  06 in the ESS For the n1 and
nEEP estimators the relative variance in zzmax rise
slowly from 10pNgalzmin zmax at low redshift to
15pNgalzmin zmax when Ngal reaches  85 of the to-
tal number of galaxies in the sample z  04 in the ESS
and can grow to 20pNgalzmin zmax at larger distances
in the redshift interval 04  z  06 for the ESS
Davis  Huchra 1982 calculate that for the mini-
mum variance estimate of the mean density close to n1
the relative uncertainty due to galaxy clustering within
the nite volume sample is
n s J3zmin zmax
V zmin zmax
where 4J3 is the volume integral of the 2-point galaxy
correlation in the survey volume bounded in redshift by
zmin zmax By using the correlation function rP 
measured from the ESS by Slezak  de Lapparent 2004
we calculate the values of J3zmin zmax and we conrm
that the relative uncertainties derived from Eq 18 for one
spectral class are comparable to those given by Eq 16 for
zmin  01 and 01  zmax  06 with Eq 18 becoming
slightly larger than Eq 16 at z  03
As pointed by Lin et al 1996 Eq 18 and the errors
calculated from the mock distributions underestimate the
error in  as they do not take into account the uncer-
tainty in the shape of the LF indeed in our mock distri-
butions the LF is not re-measured as we assume that the
true value is known In that case when the input values
of M  and  are used to calculate  all 4 density es-
timators recover the true value to 01  1 see Eqs 16
and 17 The systematic underestimation of  by 20
calculated by Willmer 1997 for LFs derived by the STY
estimator could be a measure of this eect if one assumes
that  was measured using the biased values of M  and
 but the author unfortunately does not specify Here
however we do not need to evaluate this additional source
of uncertainty because the large amplitude of the density
uctuations on scales of 100 h1 Mpc which are present
in the ESS survey cause systematic variations in the deter-
mination of both  and 0 see Sect 53 which dominate
all the other sources of error discussed here
53 Evolution in the ESS mean density
Figure 5 shows for each of the 3 ESS spectral classes the
variations with redshift zmax of the estimates 1 2 3
and EEP of the amplitude 0 for the Gaussian component
of the composite LFs see Table 1 and Eqs 3 and 6 these
estimates are based on the n1zmax n2zmax n3zmax
nEEPzmax estimators of the mean density resp see
Eqs 1015 for the ESS Rc  215 sample All quantities
plotted in Fig 5 and the other gures in this section use
zmin  01 in order to avoid biasing of the density esti-
mates as the small volume probed at z  01 suers from
under-sampling see Figs 2-4 The estimators n1 n2 n3
are calculated in steps of z  002 The random errors
due to the nite sample size for the n1 n3 and nEEP es-
timators are evaluated using Eq 16 for the n2 estimator
Eq 17 is used
We emphasize that under the assumption of a non-
evolving shape of the intrinsic LFs M  for the various
galaxy types see Sect 5 examining the variations in 0
with redshift is equivalent to examining the variations in
the ESS mean density with redshift see Eq 8 Moreover
in the following we only show and discuss the variations
in the amplitude 0 of the Gaussian component of each
spectral-type LF Nevertheless because the variations in
the amplitude  of the Schechter components for the
intermediate-type and late-type LFs are simply propor-
tional to those in 0 using the ratio 004 ln 10  whose
values are listed in Table 1 all comments on the variations
of 0 also apply to those in  In order to refer to both
0 and  we use in the following the generic amplitude
We rst compare the performances of the 4 estimators
n1 n2 n3 and nEEP Figure 5 shows that the nEEP estima-
tor Efstathiou et al 1988 yields nearly indistinguishable
results from the n1 estimator For all galaxy types the n3
estimator converges at z  05 to a value determined by
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05

the ratio of total number of galaxies in the considered sam-
ple by the integral of M  see Eq 7 the asymptotic
n3 estimator of 0 is however dominated by the observed
number of galaxies at z  03 see Sect 51 In contrast
as the n1 estimator weights dierent parts of the survey
proportionally to their volume it allows one to trace the
large-scale density uctuations across the ESS redshift in-
terval As expected the n2 estimator of 0 Eq 13 yields
intermediate values between the n1 and n3 estimators for
the 3 galaxy types In the following we thus restrict the
discussion to the extreme cases represented by the n1 and
n3 estimators
Figure 6 provides a direct comparison of the amplitude
0 of the Gaussian component of the LFs based on the
n1 estimator denoted 1 hereafter for the 3 ESS spec-
tral types The 3 curves show a relative depression in the
range 033  z  042 followed by an excess at z  045
Both features correspond to large-scale uctuations in the
redshift distribution Note that for the 3 galaxy types the
uctuations in the 1 about its mean value have a typical
amplitude of 0001 corresponding to a relative variation
of  30 These systematic errors largely dominate the
random errors in 1 indicated by the vertical error-bars in
Fig 6 see also Eqs 16 and 17 The other marked eect in
Fig 6 is the steady increase of 1 for the late-type galaxies
compared to the more stable behavior for the early-type
and intermediate-type galaxies a factor  25 increase is
measured from z  015 to z  055 We interpret this
eect as an evolution in 1 for the late-type galaxies and
provide further evidence below An increase of 3 for the
late-type galaxies is also visible in Fig 5 but the eect is
smaller as 3 applies a lower weight to the distant struc-
tures relative to those nearby

- The listed values of the luminosity function amplitude 0 are in units of h3 Mpc3 mag1 and are obtained with H0  100h
km s1 Mpc1 m  03 and   07
- The corresponding amplitude  of the Schechter component for the intermediate-type and late-type galaxies can be derived
using the values of the ratio 004 ln 10  listed in Table 1
- The 1z parameterization of the evolving amplitude 0 for the late-type galaxies should be used with caution especially
in the V and B bands more realistic parameterizations are obtained in the Rc V and B bands from the adjustment of the
number counts see Table 4 Sect 6
The variations of 1 with redshift in Fig 6 thus re-
sult from the combination of the density uctuations pro-
duced by the pattern of large-scale structure with the
possible evolution in the amplitude of the LF A sur-
vey with a wider angular extent would be necessary to
average out the eect of large-scale structures perpen-
dicular to the line-of-sight Although the dierent galaxy
types have dierent clustering properties Loveday et al
1995 which on small scales are characterized by the
morphology-density relationship Dressler 1980 they do
trace the same pattern of walls and voids at large scales
Huchra et al 1990 There has been so far no detection
of systematic variations in the proportions of the dierent
galaxy types on scales larger than  10 h1 Mpc and
thus outside galaxy clusters We therefore make the hy-
pothesis that the proportions of the dierent galaxy types
are constant at large scales and we eliminate the uctua-
tions caused by the large-scale structure by normalizing 1
for the intermediate and late-type galaxies by 1 for the
early-type galaxies The resulting relative variations of 0
in the Rc  215 sample are shown in Fig 7 The normal-
ization erases most of the uctuations in Fig 6 and only
the deviations from a distribution having similar large-
scale clustering as the early-type galaxies remain Whereas
the relative density for the intermediate-type galaxies re-
mains within the narrow interval  0810 in the redshift
interval 015  z  05 the relative density of late-type
galaxies shows a linear increase by a factor of nearly 2 in
this interval
Under the assumption that the shape M  of the in-
trinsic LFs for the various galaxy types are non-evolving
with redshift see Sect 5 the systematic increase with
redshift in the 1 estimate of 0 for the late-type galax-
ies detected in Fig7 can be interpreted as evidence for

The zero-point late
015 is measured by adjusting the
linear t to the measured values of the 1 estimate of
0 at z  051 for the late-type galaxies which is listed
in Table 2 The linear evolution model of Eq 20 is over-
plotted in Fig 6 with extrapolation to the redshift inter-
vals 01  z  015 and 05  z  06 This model follows
satisfactorily the increasing trend of the 1 estimator of 0
for the late-type galaxies recall that the deviations from
the model are mostly caused by the large-scale structures
We emphasize that the 1z estimator at redshift z
is a cumulative measure over the redshift interval 01  z
which may therefore underestimate the evolution rate for
the late-type galaxies However the contribution at each
redshift is proportional to the volume sampled as the vol-
ume increases with z2 this puts most of the weight on the
structures at z making 1 a good approximation to an in-
cremental measure of the density variations with redshift
We also conrm this result by measuring the estimate of
0 using the incremental estimator of the mean density
dn2 described in Sect 51 Eq 14 The estimator dn2
yields a similar rate of increase in 0 as the n1 estimator
but its large error bars prevent any reliable measure
Other authors have modeled the evolution in the am-
plitude  of the LF as a power of 1  z Lilly et al 1996
Heyl et al 1997 as it converts to a power of cosmic time
for m1000 1  z  t23 Cole et al 1992
Using the adopted values m0307 adjustment
of late
by a power-law function dened as
0 early
z  late
0 1  z
over the redshift interval 015  z  05 deviates from
the linear model by at most  00001 h3 Mpc3 mag1
signicantly smaller than the 1- random errors in the
measurement of late
see Fig 6 Therefore in the lim-
ited redshift range of the ESS both the linear and power-
law models provide good descriptions of the evolution of
the relative density of late-type galaxies at Rc  215 In
Sect 6 we show that when extrapolated to z  1 both
the linear and power-law models can also adjust the ESS
faint BV Rc number-counts
For numerical comparison of the 1 and 3 es-
timators of 0 we list in Table 2 their values at
zmax  051 for each spectral class of the Rc  215
Rc  205 V  210 and B  220 samples For
the early-type and intermediate-type galaxies the val-
ues of 3051 show a systematic dierence of 000006 
00008 h3 Mpc3 mag1 with the corresponding values of
1051 due to the dierent weighting of the large-scale
structure by the 2 estimators see Sect 51 In contrast
for the late-type galaxies 3051 is systematically lower
than 1051 by  0001 h3 Mpc3 mag1
in Rc to
 0002 h3 Mpc3 mag1 in V and B Ignoring the evo-
lution in the late-type density and using the 3 estima-

this t is over-plotted in Fig 7 Note that the linear t is
performed in the restricted redshift interval 015  z  05
because the survey volume is too small at z  01 see
Figs 2-4 and the redshift survey is too diluted at z 
05 to provide a reliable estimate of 0 We now assume
that 0 for the early-type galaxies does not evolve with
redshift at z  05 and that the redshift evolution in
Eq 19 can be fully attributed to the late-type galaxies
The parameterization of the late-type density evolution
therefore becomes

tor of 0 rather than 1 would then underestimate 0 at
z  05 by  40  50 in Rc and by  70 in V and B
For the late-type galaxies we also list in Table 2
the linear parameterization of 1z Eqs 20 and 21
Comparison of the zero-point of the linear parameteri-
zation 1015 with the listed value of 1051 illustrates
the increase in 1 from z  015 to z  051 Note that
Table 2 also lists the parameters derived from the shal-
lower but more complete Rc  205 sample using the
same LFs as for the Rc  215 sample see Table 1 The
evolution rate P015  445 is close to that for the deeper
Rc sample and the values of 1 and 3 dier from those
from the Rc  215 sample by less than 1- the uncer-
tainties in 1 and 3 for all considered samples in Table 2
are in the interval  00002  00003 for zmax  03
We apply a similar analysis to the ESS V  210 and
B  220 samples The measured and modeled relative 1
estimators of 0 are plotted in Fig 8 the relative 1 for
the intermediate-type galaxies are also plotted in Fig 8
As in the Rc lter the ts are performed in the restricted
redshift interval 015  z  05 In both the V and B
bands we nd an increase of the late-type galaxy density
which conrms the reality of the eect detected in the Rc
band We however measure a factor of 2 higher evolution
rate P015 in V and B than in Rc see Table 2 This may
be due to the fact that when going to bluer bands the
late-type galaxies are favored The higher evolution rate
in the V and B bands may also reect the color-dependent
selection eects aecting the redshift samples in the V and
B bands Moreover the variations in P015 from band to
band are symptomatic of the limited constraints provided
by the ESS redshift distributions In the following we show
that measuring the evolutions rates from the ESS faint
magnitude number counts yields better agreement among
the 3 lters
6 Modeling the ESS number-counts
Because the ESS number-counts extend nearly 3 magni-
tudes fainter than the spectroscopic catalogue comparison
of the observed galaxy counts with those predicted by the
LFs provides a test of how well the measured LFs and
evolution rates can be extrapolated from z  05 to z  1
Figures 10 11 12 show the observed number counts
in the Rc V and B bands resp binned in intervals of
025mag Arnouts et al 1997 In each band the magni-
tude of the faintest plotted point corresponds to the com-
pleteness limit Rc  235 V  235 and B  24 respec-
tively At bright magnitudes the plotted number count
distributions start in the rst 025mag bin where the count
is larger or equal to 50 galaxies as the counts are highly
uncertain at low count level For the same reason the ts
described in the following start in the rst bin where the
count is larger or equal to 100 that is in the bins centered
at Rc  18875 V  19625 and B  20325 respectively
For modeling the galaxy number-counts one must de-
ne a set of K-corrections We cannot use the ESS poly-
nomials K-corrections described in Sect 3 as these are
Fig 9 K-corrections in the Rc bands top panel V
middle panel and B bottom panel derived from
Coleman et al 1980 labeled CWW extrap in graph
see text for details which are used for predicting the ESO-
Sculptor galaxy number counts in Figs 10 11 and 12
Elliptical Sbc and Magellanic Irregular types are plot-
ted as dashed lines running from top to bottom and
are used to model the ESO-Sculptor K-corrections for the
early-type intermediate-type and late-type galaxies re-
spectively K-corrections for CWW extrap type Scd are
shown as dotted lines for comparison The polynomial
K-corrections calculated for the 3 ESO-Sculptor spectral
classes and valid only for z  06 are shown as heavy
solid lines with early-type intermediate-type and late-
type galaxies plotted from top to bottom
unconstrained at z  06 whereas the number-counts to
magnitudes  24 are produced by galaxies out to z  15
In replacement we use the K-corrections obtained from
the optical spectra of Coleman et al 1980 which have
been extrapolated in the UV and the IR by using the
theoretical SEDs of the GISSEL library Charlot et al
1996 for the 4 types Elliptical Sbc Scd and Magellanic
Irregular see Sawicki et al 1997 Arnouts et al 1999
These K-corrections are shown in Fig 9 for the B V
and Rc bands labeled CWW extrap We choose to use
for the ESS early-type intermediate-type and late-type
the K-corrections for the Elliptical Sbc and Magellanic
Irregular types respectively This choice is motivated by

served counts by  25 in the Rc band and by  60 in
the V and B bands
Moreover there is no value of non-evolving amplitude
for the late-type LF which can both match the bright and
faint ESS number-counts in all 3 bands A simple scaling
of the amplitude of the late-type LFs by a factor 137
185 and 190 in the Rc V and B bands resp obtained
by a weighted least-square minimization of the summed
counts to the observed counts still fails to match simul-
taneously the observed number-counts at bright and faint
magnitudes in all 3 bands this scaling makes little change
to the slope of the total counts and essentially shifts them
upward
Figures 10 11 and 12 show that in each band the num-
ber counts at magnitudes fainter than the limit of the red-
shift sample  2122mag are dominated by the late-type
galaxies Introducing a scaling factor or some evolution
in the amplitude of the early-type andor intermediate-
type LFs would therefore bring no improvement in match-
ing the observed faint number-counts Better adjustments
may only be obtained by increasing the contribution from
the late-type galaxies at faint magnitude This provides
further evidence that the late-type galaxies are evolving
In the following we show that by introducing a linear or
power-law evolution in the amplitude of the late-type LF
one obtains a very good adjustment of the observed num-
ber counts in the 3 lters Note that we deliberately do not
consider any evolution in the early-type and intermediate-
type ESS galaxy populations for the following reasons
 there are several
indications of a marked decrease
in the number density of E galaxies with redshift
Fried et al 2001 Wolf et al 2003 which compen-
sates for their passive luminosity evolution and ex-
plains that no evolution is detected by the ESS in this
population
 as far as the ESS intermediate spectral class is consid-
ered although a signicant brightening due to passive
evolution is expected for galaxies with present-day col-
ors resembling those of Sb to Sbc morphological types
using intermediate values between those provided for
Sa and Sc galaxies by Poggianti 1997 little or no evo-
lution in their luminosity density is detected out to
z  05  10 Lin et al 1999 Wolf et al 2003
We now determine the optimal evolution rate P015
dened in Eq 20 for the late-type galaxies by a 2-stage
procedure We rst vary the value of P015 and per-
form a weighted least-square t of the summed predicted
counts to the observed counts with the amplitude of
the early-type and intermediate-type LFs kept xed The
weights are dened as the square-root of the observed to-
tal counts and might thus underestimates the true uncer-
tainty in the observed counts which should also account
for galaxy clustering we however veried that increasing
the rms errors by as much as a factor of 2 a wide overes-
timate of cosmic variance over the area of the ESS would
make negligeable change in the derived evolution rates
For each value of P015 the amplitude of the late-type LF
Fig 12 Same as Fig 10 for the ESS number-counts per
025 mag interval in the B band The amplitude 0 of the
Gaussian component of the luminosity function used for
each galaxy class is is identical to that used in Fig 15
The values of zhigh are 15 in the Rc band and 20 in the
B and V bands Note that N m and NTS m in Eqs 23
and 24 resp are dened as number counts per unit solid
angle and per unit magnitude interval The curves plot-
ted in Figs 13 to 15 are then multiplied by 025mag and

see next Sect The reference amplitude of the late-type
LF is therefore a function of P015 As this value may
however not provide the optimal match between the pre-
dicted and observed late-type counts we allow in each
least-square t for a scaling factor to the amplitude of the
late-type LF The full procedure yields a rst estimate
of the evolution parameter P015 dened as the value for
which the reduced 2 is smallest 22 43 and 33 in the
Rc V  and B bands resp with scaling factors 0931 1005
and 11287 for the late-type LF amplitude The predicted
number-counts for the late-type galaxies with the above
quoted evolution rates and scaling factors are plotted as a
light solid line in Figs 10 11 and 12 and the correspond-
ing summed counts over the 3 galaxy types as a heavy
solid line
We have also looked for other minima of the reduced
2 by allowing for a scaling factor in the amplitude of the
early-type and intermediate-type LFs and searching for a
common scaling factor for the 3 galaxy types For values
of P015 around the rst minima listed above we iterate
over the values of the scaling factors for the 3 classes
the output scaling factors for the late-type galaxies are
applied to both the early-type and intermediate-type LF
amplitudes and the new scaling factor for the late-type
galaxies which minimizes the 2 is calculated After 5 to
10 iterations this converges to a common scaling factor for
the 3 galaxy types When considering the nal reduced 2
obtained by these iterations a slightly smaller evolution
rate P015  20 is obtained for the Rc counts with a com-
mon scaling factor of 0972 the same minimum P015  43
is conrmed in the V band with a common scaling factor
of 1003 for the 3 galaxy types and a slightly higher evo-
lution rate P015  38 is obtained in the B band with a
common scaling factor 1055 Note that in each lter the
common scaling factor for the 3 galaxy types is closer to
unity than the factor used when scaling only the late-type
LF The predicted number-counts with a common scaling
factor are indistinguishable from those in which only the
late-type LFs are scaled which are shown in Figs 10-12

ing the linear evolution model of the amplitude of the

de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
of early-type and intermediate-type galaxies provides ev-
idence that the late-type galaxies evolve out to z  10
The inserts of Figs 10 11 and 12 show that in the 3 bands
the expected redshift distribution of the galaxies detected
in the ESS number counts have a peak near z  05 and
extend to z  1 Note also that the number counts provide
better agreement among the evolution rates in the 3 bands
P015  20 22 in Rc P015  43 in V  P015  33 38
in B that those measured from the redshift survey only
P015  35 in Rc P015  75 in V  P015  86 in B see
Sect 53
We estimate the uncertainty in the value of P015 mea-
sured from the number-counts by applying the following
tests i in the late-type LF we change alternatively the
slope  of the Schechter component from 03 to 039 the
value actually measured from the Rc  215 sample see
Paper I and the peak magnitude M0 of the Gaussian
component by 03mag as these are the 2 parameters
which have the largest impact on P015 ii we vary the
amplitude of the early-type or intermediate-type LFs by
10 which provides a conservative estimate of the un-
certainties in the values of  and 0 for these samples
see Eqs 16-17 Each of these tests yields a change in
P015 by  05 We thus adopt as a conservative uncer-
tainty P015  10 The above values of P015 obtained
from the number-counts then dier by 1  2 from lter
to lter
We emphasize that despite the incompleteness in blue
galaxies in the ESS V and B spectroscopic samples when
used together with the ESS V and B magnitude number-
counts they do provide useful constraints on the evolution
rate for the late-type galaxies and yield consistent results
with those derived from the Rc number-counts Note that
in the estimation of P015 from the number-counts the
V and B spectroscopic samples are used only to derive
the amplitude of the LFs by normalizing to the observed
redshift distributions The consistent evolution rates ob-
tained in the B V  and Rc bands reinforces the detected
evolution as a real eect The tendency of an increased
evolution rate measured in the V and B bands compared
to the Rc may be due to the higher sensitivity of the
V and B bands to the late-type galaxies already men-
tioned in Sect 53 at the peak redshift probed by the
ESS number-counts z  05 taken together the B and V
bands probe the rest-wavelength interval  2700 4000A
lying just blue-ward of the CaII H  K break the signif-
icant star formation activity present in late-type galaxies
does cause an increased ux at these wavelengths
Note that applying the above analysis using pure
Schechter LFs with a common slope   148 for the Rc
V  and B LFs Paper I yields values of P015 smaller by
05 than those derived from the composite LFs However
the use of pure Schechter LFs yields a marked degeneracy
between the slope  of the late-type LF and the evolution
rate P015 For example changing the slope  of the late-
type LF from 164 measured from the Rc  205 sample
to 148 measured from the Rc  215 sample Paper I
yields an increase in P015 by nearly one unit This is to be
contrasted with the change of only 03 in P015 obtained
when changing the slope of the Schechter component of
the late-type composite LF from 03 to 039 note the
large variation The degeneracy in the faint-end slope 
of a Schechter LF could be partially reduced using the red-
shift distribution but there remains large uncertainties as
the ESS spectroscopic sample is far from a fair sample of
Universe and the redshift distribution fails in averaging
out the large-scale structure see Sect 7
In Table 4 we list the values of P015 obtained in the
3 lters for m0307 there the secondary iter-
ation stage aimed at obtaining a common scaling factor
for the 3 spectral classes is not used as it makes a small
dierence in the evolution parameter We also measure
P015 for m1000 in that case the LF char-
acteristic magnitudes M0 and M  listed in Table 1 are
shifted by M  03mag the variation in absolute magni-
tude corresponding to the change in luminosity distance
at z  03 the approximate peak redshift of the ESS see
Sect 4 The corresponding values of 0 and  for the
early-type intermediate-type and non-evolving late-type
LFs obtained by normalizing the integral of the expected
redshift distribution with m1000 to the ob-
served number of galaxies in the interval 001  z  081
are also listed in Table 3
Finally we apply the power-law evolution model of
Eq 22 to the number-counts and derive the best-t value
of  for both sets of cosmological parameters the resulting
values of  are listed in Table 4 As for the P015 parameter
the uncertainty in  is estimated to be of order of 10 In
the 3 bands the minimum 2 is systematically smaller for
the linear evolution model than for the power-law model
but the dierence is small Note that the larger evolu-
tion parameters obtained with cosmological parameters
m1000 are due to the corresponding smaller
volume element at increasing z

spectral-type
In Figs 13 14 and 15 we compare the observed redshift
distributions for the 3 spectral classes in the Rc  215
V  210 and B  220 samples resp with the expected
distributions calculated using the composite LFs listed in
Table 1 For the observed distributions we plot the 2
histograms obtained with a redshift bin z  008 and
oset by 004 in redshift in order to illustrate visually
the uncertainties in the observed distribution A large
bin size in redshift is used in order to smooth out the
variations due to large-scale clustering this scale would
correspond to  120 h1 Mpc at small redshift larger
than the typical size of the voids in the redshift surveys to

As in Sect 51 the expected curves in Figs 13 14 and
15 are based on the integral of the selection function over
the bin-size z  008 and we use the K-corrections cal-
culated for the average spectral-type  TS  among each
spectral class see Eq 1 For the 3 galaxy types and in
the 3 lters the amplitudes 0 and  dening each non-

integral of the expected distribution to the observed num-

004 ln 10  takes the values listed in Table 1 The re-
sulting values of 0 and  are indicated inside each graph
of Figs 13 to 15 and are also listed in Table 3 in column
labeled m0307 These values of 0 dier from
the estimates 3051 listed in Table 2 because the latter
result from an integral over the narrower redshift interval
01  z  051 see Sect 53
For the early-type and intermediate-type galaxies the
expected distributions in Figs 13 14 and 15 provide a
good match to the observed histograms For the late-type
galaxies the expected no-evolution redshift curves with
P015  00 show a systematic shift towards low redshifts
when compared to the observed distributions Moreover
the expected curves lie systematically near the lower val-
ues of the observed histograms for z  03 These eects
are present in the 3 lters
For the late-type galaxies we also plot in Figs 13
14 and 15 the expected redshift distributions with the
values of the evolution factor P015 listed in Table 4 for
m0307 The values of 0015 and 015
which normalize the integral of each evolving distribution

interval 001  z  081 are indicated in Figs 13 to 15
Note that these values dier from those listed in Table 4
as the latter are derived by normalization to the total
number-counts The dierence is however small  10
thus bringing a posteriori evidence of consistency between
the redshift and magnitude distributions Note also that in
the evolving curves we have extrapolated to 0  z  015
the linear evolution of  for the late-type galaxies param-
eterized in Eq 20 although it was measured from the re-
stricted redshift interval 015  z  05 Our motivations
for this choice are
 if we assume that  remains constant and at the value
of the linear t at z  015 for redshifts  015 the
expected redshift distributions show an marked excess
of galaxies at these redshifts which does not match
the observed distribution this eect is observed in all
lters
 the location of the ESS was visually selected by ex-
amining copies of the ESOSERC R and J atlas sky
survey with the criteria to avoid nearby galaxies and
nearby groups and clusters of galaxies This implies
that the ESS survey has a systematically low density
of galaxies at z  01
In contrast to the no-evolution curves the evolving
late-type distributions provide a good match to the ob-

of galaxies in the interval 001  z  081
served histograms in Figs 13 14 and 15 the low redshift
peak is shifted to higher redshift z  02 and the high
redshift tail has a higher amplitude which better matches
the observed data The best agreement of the observed
and evolving expected curve is obtained in the Rc band
Fig 13 In the V and B bands Figs 14 and 15 the ex-
pected curves with P015  43 and P015  33 resp may
be still be too low at z  03 Using P015  70 and
P015  80 in the V and B bands as obtained from the
direct ts of 1 in Sect 53 yields a better match of
the observed redshift distributions at z  03 but sys-
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
tematically underestimate the distributions at z  015
This may be an indication that extrapolation of the lin-
ear model of Eq 20 to z  015 is not satisfying for large
values of P015 The varying incompleteness with galaxy
type which aects the V and B samples is also likely to
complicate the adjustment of the redshift distributions
Note that the incompleteness of the full sample is
used to correct for the incompleteness in apparent mag-
nitude of each spectral-type sample in Figs 13 14 and
15 Ideally one should use the incompleteness calculated
for each spectral class However galaxies with no red-
shift measurement have no spectral-type determination
We have examined the dependence of the incompleteness
as a function of galaxy-type using the colors of the galax-
ies without redshift as these are correlated with galaxy
type For the Rc  205 sample the incompleteness is
uniform with galaxy colors justifying the use of the aver-
age incompleteness for the full sample For the V  210
and B  220 samples the incompleteness is signicantly
stronger for the bluer galaxies we cannot however evalu-
ate the incompleteness per spectral-type from the colors
as the relation between color and spectral-type suers a
large dispersion The relative larger incompleteness in blue
galaxies at faint magnitudes of the V and B spectroscopic
samples converts into a relative larger incompleteness in
faint late-type galaxies compared to early-type galaxies
This might explain why the expected curves for the late-
type galaxies in Figs 14 and 15 appear to systematically
under-estimate the observed distribution
As already mentioned in Sect 3 the ESS late-type
class contains predominantly ScSd and dI galaxies An
interesting issue is how the giant ScSd and dwarf dI
galaxies contribute to this evolution In the composite t
to the late-type LF at Rc  215 shown in the lower left
panel of Fig 1 the giant and dwarf components cross-
over near M Rc  1855 log h for m 1000
for m 0307 this magnitude converts approx-
imately to M Rc  188  5 log h see Sect 4 We
therefore calculate the observed and expected redshift
distributions for the 2 following sub-samples the bright
sample with M Rc  190  5 log h containing 227
galaxies which are predominantly ScSd galaxies the
faint sample with M Rc  190  5 log h containing
82 galaxies which are predominantly dI galaxies Lower
panel of Fig 16 shows that an evolution factor with
P015  30 has a small impact on the distribution of
galaxies with M Rc  190  5 log h and both ex-
pected curves are compatible with the observed distribu-
tion In contrast the expected no evolution curve provides
a poor match to the observed distribution of galaxies with
M Rc  1905 log h whereas the expected curve with
P015  30 provides a better agreement The expected dis-
tribution for a higher evolution rate P015  60 is also
shown in Fig 16 for the bright galaxies it provides an even
better adjustment note that if the dI galaxies where not
evolving a higher evolution rate than measured for the
ScSddI altogether would be expected for the ScSd
galaxies alone This suggests that the ScSd galaxies are
likely to contribute signicantly to the detected late-type
evolution We however cannot exclude evolution of the dI
galaxies
8 Comparison of the ESS evolution with other
surveys
Most other redshift surveys to z  05  10 detect evo-
lution in the luminosity function The evolution aects
either the amplitude  of the LF number-density evolu-
tion or its shape via the characteristic magnitude lumi-
nosity evolution andor its faint-end behavior Evolution
in the luminosity density is also often used for measur-
ing the evolution rate as it has the advantage to account
for the 3 types of evolution Note that for a non-evolving
shape of the luminosity function M dM  any evolution
in the amplitude  see Eq 7 yields an identical evolution
rate of the luminosity density
In the following we only consider the evidence for
separate evolution of the ES0 and Spiral galaxies as
evolution in the full galaxy population does not allow
one to isolate the evolving population For instance the
total luminosity density L in the CFRS shows an in-
crease with redshift which Lilly et al 1996 model as
Lz  1  z2705 at 4400 A for an m1000
cosmology This is close to the value   26 obtained from
the ESS B band number-counts in Table 4 suggesting that
the evolution rate for the Spiral galaxies in the CFRS may
be higher than in the ESS A direct measure of the evolu-
tion rate of the blue galaxies in the CFRS bluer than a
non-evolving Sbc galaxy would however be required for a
quantitative comparison with the ESS
Because there is weak evidence for evolution in
the faint-end slope of the LF in the existing surveys
Heyl et al 1997 we restrict the following discussion to
the evidence for i number-density evolution and ii lu-
minosity evolution
81 Number-density evolution
Ellis et al 1996 detect a marked density evolution in
the Autob star-forming galaxies by a factor 2 between
z  015 and z  04 which would correspond to an over-
all fading of the population by 05mag in the bJ band This
is comparable to the ESS evolution rate derived above
for P015  30 the density increases by a factor 175
between z  015 and z  04 Further analysis of the
Autob survey based on galaxy spectral types Heyl et al
1997 leads to detection of a strong density evolution in
the late-type spiral galaxies Sbc and Scd which they
model as z  1  z29 for the Sbc galaxies and as
z  1  z35 for the Scd galaxies in a cosmology with
m1000 These values are in acceptable agree-
ment with the   26 value derived from the ESS in the
B band
In the CNOC2 the dominant evolution detected by
Lin et al 1999 in the redshift range 01  z  055 is a
strong density evolution of the late-type galaxies dened
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
as galaxies with U BV RcIc colors similar to those com-
puted from the Scd and Im templates of Coleman et al
1980 the authors model the evolution as z  eP z
with P  28 10 and P  23 10 in the BAB band for
m  10 m  02 resp and P  2910 P  2610
in the Rc band for m  10 m  02 respectively At
z  01 eP z and 1  z can be expanded into 1 P z and
1  z resp which would yield a reasonable agreement at
low redshift between the CNOC2 and the ESS in both the
B and Rc bands However at z  1 e25z is a factor of 2
larger than 1  z25 implying a stronger evolution rate
in the CNOC2 than in the ESS
Obtained with a similar observational technique as the
CNOC2 the eld sample of the CNOC1 Lin et al 1997
shows an increase of the luminosity density of galaxies by
a factor 3 between z  025 and z  055 for galaxies with
rest-frame colors bluer than a non-evolving Sbc galaxy In
the NORRIS survey of the Corona Borealis Supercluster
Small et al 1997b detect a similar evolution rate the
amplitude  of the Schechter LF for galaxies with strong
OII emission line increases by nearly a factor 3 from z 
02 to 02  z  05 These various values of the number-
density evolution rate are stronger than the increase by a
factor 18 in the ESS density of late-type galaxies which
we derive for P015  30 between z  02 et z  05
In the CADIS survey in which redshifts are derived
from a combination of wide and medium-band lters
Fried et al 2001 detect an increase of the Johnson B
luminosity density of Sa-Sc galaxies with redshift which
is partly due to an increase in the amplitude  of the
tted Schechter luminosity function and can be mod-
eled as z  1  69z for m1000 and
as z  1  078z for m0307 The evolv-
ing term in the luminosity density can be converted into
z  1  34z  015 resp z  1  070z 015
Whereas the CADIS evolution rate is similar to that in the
ESS for m1000 it is much smaller than in the
ESS for m0307 see Table 4 note however
that this comparison may be complicated by the fact that
the considered evolving CADIS population contains early-
type Spiral galaxies to the contrary of the ESS late-type
spectral class
In contrast the recent COMBO-17 survey Wolf et al
2003 which is also based on a combination of wide and
medium-band lters shows no signicant evolution in the
number-density and luminosity density of either Sa-Sc
and Sbc-Starburst galaxies from z  03 to z  11 in
the Johnson B and SDSS r bands Fukugita et al 1996
Moreover whereas the various mentioned surveys CFRS
Autob NORRIS CNOC2 CNOC1 CADIS show no
or a weak change in the luminosity density of early-type
E-S0 or red galaxies over the considered redshift range
the COMBO-17 survey detects a marked increase with
redshift by a factor of 4 in the contribution from the
E-Sa galaxies to the r and B luminosity densities for
m0307 Wolf et al 2003 The dierent re-
sults between the COMBO-17 and the other redshift sur-
veys may be due to the complex selection eects inher-
ent to surveys based on multi-medium-band photometry
such as the COMBO-17 and which are most critical for
emission-line galaxies These eects however do not seem
to aect the CADIS survey
At last the evolution detected in the far infrared from
IRAS galaxies Saunders et al 1990 Bertin et al 1997
Takeuchi et al 2003 can be characterized as z  1
z with   3  34 for pure density evolution both
cosmologies considered in this article are used depending
on the authors The evolution of the IRAS galaxies is
consistent with the ESS late-type evolution in agreement
with the fact that IRAS galaxies may represent a sub-
population of the optical spiral galaxies
82 Luminosity evolution
The apparent density evolution detected in the ESS could
also be produced by a luminosity evolution of the late-type
spiral galaxies if these galaxies were brighter at higher
redshift they would enter the survey in larger numbers
at a given apparent magnitude Using the values of the
power-law index  listed in Table 4 and the slopes of the
ESS magnitude number-counts Arnouts et al 1997 we
can estimate a corresponding magnitude brightening For
cosmological parameters m1000 we measure
from Table 4 an increase in the number-density of galaxies
by a factor 28 between z  0 and z  05 and by a factor
57 between z  05 and z  1 in the Rc band in the B
bands the density increases by a factor 29 at z  05
and 61 at z  1 For m0307 the density in-
creases by 21 and 35 at z  05 and z  1 resp in Rc
and by 24 and 46 at z  05 and z  1 resp in B Using
the slopes   038 in the Rc band and   046 in the
B band nm  10m for the ESS magnitude number-
counts Arnouts et al 1997 these values of the density
increase are equivalent to  12mag and  20mag bright-
ening of the late-type ESS galaxies at z  05 and z  1
resp in Rc and a  11mag and a  17mag brightening
resp in B for m1000 and to  08mag and
 14mag brightening resp in both the Rc and B bands
for m0307 the steeper evolution rate in the
B band is compensated by a steeper slope of the number-
counts also in the B band
These brightening estimates for the ESS late-type
galaxies with m0307 are comparable to those
caused by the passive evolution of an Sc galaxy due to
the evolution of the stellar population From the model
predictions of Poggianti 1997 using m04500
and H0  50 km s1 Mpc1 which imply an age of
the Universe of 15 Gyr an Sc galaxy brightens by 
06mag and  12mag in its rest-frame R band at z  05
and z  10 resp and by  09mag  15mag resp in
its rest-frame B band A comparable or stronger bright-
ening is expected for the Elliptical galaxies at these red-
shifts  06mag
 30mag in B Poggianti 1997 However there are indi-
cations of a marked decrease in the number density of E
in R  07mag
and  14mag
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
galaxies with redshift Fried et al 2001 Wolf et al 2003
which compensates for their luminosity evolution which
explains why no evolution in this population is detected
by the ESS
Lilly et al 1995 detect a 1mag brightening of the
CFRS blue galaxies dened as galaxies with rest-frame
colors bluer than a non-evolving Sbc template from
Coleman et al 1980 between the intervals 02  z  05
and 05  z  075 in an m1000 cosmology
they however cannot discriminate whether this brighten-
ing is due to luminosity or density evolution With   26
see Table 4 the ESS B density of late-type galaxies in-
creases by a factor 16 between z  025 and z  0625
the median value of the 2 quoted CFRS intervals which
corresponds to a brightening of  044mag nearly a factor
2 smaller than in the CFRS Cohen 2002 also detect for
the emission-line dominated galaxies at z  1 when com-
pared to the measurement of Lin et al 1996 at z  0
a mild brightening by  075mag in the R band for an
m0300 cosmology which is a factor 2 smaller
than in the ESS estimated brightening in the Rc band for
m0307
9 Conclusions further discussion and prospects
Using the GaussianSchechter composite LFs measured
for the ESO-Sculptor Survey we obtain evidence for evo-
lution in the late spectral-type population containing late-
type Spiral ScSd and dwarf Irregular galaxies This
evolution is detected as an increase of the galaxy density
nz which can be modeled as nz  1  P015z  015
with P015  3  1 or as nz  1  z with  
2 1 using the currently favored cosmological parameters
m0307 for m1000 P015  4  1
and   25  1 Both models yield a good match of the
ESS BV Rc redshift distributions to 21  22mag and the
number-counts to 23  235mag which probe the galaxy
distribution to redshifts z  05 and z  10 respectively
Using both the redshift distributions and the number-
counts allows us to lift part of the degeneracies aecting
faint galaxy number counts the redshift distributions al-
low to isolate the evolving populations whereas the faint
number counts provide better constraints on the evolution
rate These results are based on the hypothesis that the
shape of the LF for the ESS late-type class does not evolve
with redshift out to z  1
Examination of the other existing redshift surveys to
z  0510 indicates that a wide range of number-density
evolution rates have been obtained The evolution rate
of the ScSddI galaxies detected in the ESS is among
the range of measured values with some surveys having
weaker of higher evolution rates The most similar survey
to the ESS the CNOC2 yields a twice larger increase
in the number density of late-type Spiral and Irregular
galaxies at z  1
A priori density evolution indicates that mergers could
play a signicant role in the evolution of late-type Spiral
and Irregular galaxies Le Fevre et al 2000 detect a
 20 increase in the fraction of galaxy mergers from
z  0 to z  1 which can be modeled as  1  z32
interestingly examination of their Fig1 indicates that a
signicant fraction of the merger galaxies have a Spiral or
Irregular structure
The ESS density increase for the ScSddI galaxies
could also be caused by a  1mag brightening of these
galaxy populations at z  05 and a  15 20mag bright-
ening at z  1 depending on the lter and cosmological
parameters This luminosity evolution is compatible with
the expected passive brightening of Sc galaxies at increas-
ing redshifts Poggianti 1997 Driver 2001 also shows
that the Hubble Deep Field Williams et al 1996 bi-
variate brightness distributions for Elliptical Spiral and
Irregular galaxies are all consistent with passive luminos-
ity evolution in the 3 redshift bins 03  06 06  08
08  10 The ESS brightening at z  1 agrees with the
value measured from the CFRS blue galaxies Lilly et al
1995 but is twice smaller than that measured by Cohen
2002 for emission-line dominated galaxies
In all analyses of the redshift and magnitude dis-
tributions the major diculty is to distinguish be-
tween luminosity and density evolution as these pro-
duce the same net eect on the redshift and magni-
tude distributions Interpretation of density and lumi-
nosity evolution of a galaxy population is also com-
plicated by possible variations in the star formation
rate with cosmic time Lilly et al 1998 evaluate an
increase in the star formation rate of galaxies with
large disks by a factor of  3 at z  07 which
shows as an increase of the luminosity density at bluer
wavelengths Using PEGASE Fioc  Rocca-Volmerange
1997 Rocca-Volmerange  Fioc 1999 also show that
the Sa-Sbc galaxies have a star formation rate which varies
more rapidly in the interval 0  z  1 than for the ES0
or Sc-Im galaxies
The ESS suggests that the ScSd galaxies are an
evolving population but evolution in the dI galaxies can-
not be excluded Whether the Spiral galaxies or the
Irregular galaxies or both populations contribute signif-
icantly to the excess number-counts is still unclear from
the various existing analyses using photometric redshifts
Liu et al 1998 detected a signicant amplitude increase
and brightening of the U LF of Sbc and bluer galaxies in
the redshift interval 0  z  05 together with an excess
population of starburst galaxies at z  03 which are ab-
sent at z  03 galaxy number counts in the near infrared
Martini 2001 Totani et al 2001 which are less sensi-
tive to current star formation also allow some moderate
number evolution of the Spiral galaxies andor Irregular
galaxies with   1 see above Evolutionary eects are
also detected at higher redshifts Driver et al 1998 show
that at 1  z  3 the redshift distributions of Sabc galax-
ies to I  25 and of SdIrr galaxies to I  24 require some
number and luminosity evolution but see Driver 2001
This could be consistent with the recent deep optical and
infrared observations which favor mild luminosity evolu-
tion of the overall galaxy population Pozzetti et al 2003
de Lapparent et al The ESO-Sculptor Survey Evolution at z  01  05
Kashikawa et al 2003 Nevertheless none of these sur-
veys allow one to isolate one evolving population among
the Spiral and IrregularPeculiar galaxies
In contrast some surveys favor IrregularPeculiar
galaxies as a major contributor to the excess count an
excess population of IrregularPeculiar galaxies was di-
rectly identied as the cause for a strong deviation from
no-evolution in the I and K number-counts per morpho-
logical type Glazebrook et al 1995 Huang et al 1998
a population of gently-evolving starbursting dwarves was
also invoked to explain these excess objects Campos
1997 Using morphology of galaxies obtained from Hubble
Space Telescope images Im et al 1999 provide further
evidence for a marked increase in the relative abun-
dance of Irregular and Peculiar galaxies which they in-
terpret as starbursting sub-L ES0 and Spiral galaxies
Totani  Yoshii 1998 also detect such an excess popu-
lation at z  05 Using again Hubble Space Telescope
imaging for galaxy morphology Brinchmann et al 1998
estimate a  30 increase in the proportion of galaxies
with an irregular morphology at 07  z  09 see also
Abraham et al 1996 Volonteri et al 2000
Other surveys identify Spiral galaxies as the evolv-
ing population morphological number counts based
on Hubble Space Telescope images indicate that the
Spiral counts rise more steeply than the no-evolution
model Abraham et al 1996 By complementing space-
based images with ground-based spectroscopic redshifts
Brinchmann et al 1998 detect a  1mag brightening of
the Spiral galaxies by z  1 Schade et al 1996 also mea-
sure a  16mag brightening of the central surface bright-
ness of galaxy disks at 05  z  11
We emphasize that measuring a reliable evolution rate
requires a realistic parameterization of the intrinsic LFs
of each galaxy population We show here that the ESS
GaussianSchechter composite LFs provide more robust
constraints on the evolution rate than pure Schechter LFs
as a small change in the faint-end slope has a large inci-
dence onto the number-counts In contrast variations in
the faint-end slope of the dE and dI galaxies the only
populations for which the Schechter faint-end is poorly de-
termined have a smaller impact on the adjustment on the
number counts Totani et al 2001 also show that sepa-
rating the E and dE galaxies into a GaussianSchechter
LF does yield a better agreement of the K number-counts
at K  225 than a pure Schechter function for the joint
class of EdE
By using better measures of the intrinsic LFs for
the various galaxy types one should be able to ob-
tain improved measurements of the galaxy evolution
rates and eventually to use the faint number counts to
probe the cosmological parameters Koo et al 1993 and
Gronwall  Koo 1995 had already suggested that pas-
sive luminosity evolution is sucient to match the B num-
ber counts thus implying that the number counts could
be used to probe the curvature of space Pozzetti et al
1996 and Metcalfe et al 2001 then showed that pas-
sive luminosity evolution with a low value of m provide
good ts to UV-optical-near-infrared galaxy counts The
recent adjustments of very deep optical and near-infrared
galaxy counts Totani  Yoshii 2000 Nagashima et al
2001 Totani et al 2001 Nagashima et al 2002 which
probe the galaxy distribution to z  3 further conrm that
the Einstein-de Sitter cosmology with m1000
is excluded at a high condence level see also Totani et al
1997 He et al 2000 whereas by using the currently fa-
vored values of m  03 and   07 these ts con-
strain the evolution rate of galaxies in the hierarchical
clustering picture with only some mild number evolution
of SbcSdm galaxies allowed Totani et al 2001
Under-going deep redshift surveys to z  1 raise
new prospects along this line The present ESS analy-
sis shows the usefulness of using both the magnitude
and redshift distributions for studying galaxy evolution
By obtaining the redshift distributions per galaxy type
to z  1 over large volumes which average out the
large-scale structure spectroscopic redshift survey such
as the VIRMOS Le Fevre  Vettolani 2003 and DEEP2
Davis et al 2003 projects should provide improved clues
on the evolving galaxy populations at z  1 and bet-
ter constrain the nature of this evolution If these surveys
conrm that all galaxy types only experience mild lumi-
nositydensity evolution complementing the deep infrared
galaxy counts with morphological information might allow
one to lift the degeneracy in the faint infrared number-
counts and to conrm whether a low matter-density uni-
verse is favored This will however require a detailed
knowledge i of the luminosity-size relation for distant
galaxies of various morphological type used to model the
selection eects caused by the cosmological dimming in
surface brightness see Totani  Yoshii 2000 and ii of
the interstellar and intergalactic extinction
