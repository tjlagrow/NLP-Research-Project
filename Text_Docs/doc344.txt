Abstract The present-day globular cluster populations of galaxies re-
ect the cumulative eects of billions of years of galaxy evolution via such
processes as mergers tidal stripping accretion and in some cases the
partial or even complete destruction of other galaxies If large galaxies
have grown by consuming their smaller neighbors or by accreting ma-
terial stripped from other galaxies then their observed globular cluster
systems are an amalgamation of the globular cluster systems of their pro-
genitors Careful analysis of the globular cluster populations of galaxies
can thus allow astronomers to reconstruct their dynamical histories
Introduction
The origin of galaxies is one of the great outstanding problems in modern astro-
physics How and when did galaxies form How have they evolved over time
How does environment inuence their properties
One way to unravel the secrets of galaxy formation is by studying their
globular cluster populations Most galaxies possess globular cluster systems of
various richness ranging from dwarf galaxies with only a handful of globulars
to supergiant elliptical galaxies with tens of thousands of globulars surrounding
them see Harris 1991 or van den Bergh 2000 for reviews Because globular
clusters are among the oldest stellar ensembles in the universe they can provide
important clues about the formation of their parent galaxies
The earliest studies of globular clusters were by necessity limited to our
own Galaxy and its nearest neighbors Over the past few decades however
there has been tremendous progress in our understanding of globular cluster
systems of other galaxies One of the most important recent discoveries in
the study of extragalactic globular cluster systems is that most large galaxies
appear to possess two or more chemically distinct globular cluster populations
eg Gebhardt  Kissler-Patig 1999 Forbes  Forte 2000 Kundu  Whitmore
2001 Some examples are shown in Figure 1 where two peaks are seen in
the distribution of globular cluster metallicities for clusters associated with four
large elliptical galaxies
A number of dierent theories have been proposed to explain the origin
of these bimodal globular cluster metallicity distributions An obvious way to

systems associated with four giant elliptical galaxies Note the presence
of two distinct peaks in most cases The majority of large elliptical
galaxies studied to date exhibit bimodal globular cluster metallicity
distributions
generate two or more chemically distinct globular cluster populations in galaxies
would be through two or more bursts of globular cluster formation This might
occur for example if mergers of gas-rich galaxies trigger the formation of new
globulars Schweizer 1987 Ashman  Zepf 1992 resulting in the birth of mul-
tiple generations of globular clusters Similarly one might envision a multiphase
galaxy collapse model in which the metal-poor globular clusters formed during
the initial collapse of a protogalactic gas cloud and the metal-rich globulars
formed some time later Forbes Brodie  Grillmair 1997 Larsen et al 2001
In both of these scenarios the metal-poor globular clusters surrounding galaxies
such as those shown in Figure 1 would be their original population that formed
Galaxy Deconstruction
from low-metallicity gas at early epochs and the metal-rich globulars would
have formed more recently from gas that was enriched by stellar evolution
Alternatively bimodal or multimodal globular cluster metallicity distribu-
tions could also arise quite naturally from galaxy mergers andor accretion of
globulars stripped from other galaxies without needing to invoke the formation
of multiple generations of globulars Cote Marzke  West 1998 Cote Marzke
West  Minniti 2000 Motivation for this model came from a simple fact for
those elliptical galaxies that exhibit a bimodal globular cluster metallicity dis-
tribution the metallicity of the metal-rich peak shows a clear correlation with
parent galaxy luminosity in the sense that the most luminous galaxies have the
most metal-rich globulars Forbes Brodie  Grillmair 1997 Forbes  Forte
2001 However no such correlation is seen for the metal-poor peak it appears
to be largely independent of parent galaxy luminosity To my collaborators and
I this suggests that the metal-rich globular clusters are innate to large ellipticals
and the metal-poor ones were added later either through mergers or accretion
2 Globular clusters as diagnostics of galaxy mergers
There is no doubt that galaxy mergers have occurred frequently throughout
the history of the universe Figure 2 shows an image of a supergiant elliptical
galaxy in which the partially digested remains of several smaller galaxies are still
clearly visible Many large galaxies today may have grown to their present sizes
by devouring smaller companions If so what becomes of the globular cluster
populations of the galaxies that were consumed
There is also evidence of ongoing galaxy destruction in rich clusters and
countless galaxies may have met their demise over a Hubble time eg Gregg
 West 1998 Calcaneo-Rodin et al 2000 An example is shown in Figure 3
Because they are dense stellar systems globular clusters are likely to survive
the disruption of their parent galaxy and will accumulate over time in the cores
of rich galaxy clusters The ongoing destruction of the moderate-sized elliptical
galaxy shown in Figure 3 for example will likely strew several hundred globulars
into intergalactic space Some of these may eventually be incorporated into other
galaxies a sort of recycling on cosmic scales Muzzio 1987 In particular giant
elliptical galaxies at the centers of rich galaxy clusters which are observed to
have enormously rich globular cluster populations may have inherited myriad
intergalactic globular clusters West et al 1995
If large galaxies have grown by consuming smaller neighbors or by accreting
material torn from other galaxies then their present-day globular cluster systems
are an amalgamation of the globular cluster systems of their victims Cote et al
1998 and Cote et al 2000 showed that the growth of large galaxies through
mergers or accretion will invariably be accompanied by the capture of metal-poor
globulars resulting in bimodal or even multi-modal metallicity distributions
that are strikingly similar to those see in Figure 1
Our prescription for building a large elliptical galaxy with a bimodal glob-
ular cluster metallicity distribution is remarkably simple
Galaxy Deconstruction
Figure 2
The brightest elliptical galaxy in the cluster Abell 3827
Several smaller cannibalized galaxies are clearly evident in the central
regions Globular clusters belonging to these galaxies are likely to
survive the eventual disruption of their parent galaxies and thus will
become part of this giant elliptical If most large elliptical galaxies have
grown by cannibalizing smaller neighbors then their globular cluster
populations today are composite systems that can provide information
about the progenitor galaxies
 We assume that galaxies obey a Schechter-like luminosity function as is
observed This sets the relative numbers of galaxies of dierent luminosi-
ties that are available for merging
 We assume that each galaxy is born with its own intrinsic globular cluster
population and that the number of globulars per unit galaxy luminosity
is constant which is consistent with observations Harris 1991 This
Galaxy Deconstruction
determines how many globular clusters each galaxy has available to donate
during mergers
 We assume again from observations that the mean metallicity of a galaxys
original globular cluster population increases monotonically with parent
galaxy luminosity Cote et al 1998 Smaller galaxies have metal-poorer
globulars on average than larger galaxies
Figure 3
A tidally disrupted galaxy in the Coma cluster from Gregg
 West 1998 The top panel shows the raw image and the bottom
panel has been cleaned of foreground objects to highlight the  150
kpc long plume of material The partial or in some cases complete
disruption of galaxies in dense environments will create a population of
intergalactic stars and globular clusters These freely roaming globulars
may be accreted later by other galaxies
Galaxy Deconstruction
Beginning with a medium-sized elliptical galaxy as a seed we allow it to
consume its smaller neighbors at random stopping after enough mergers have
occurred to yield a large elliptical We assume that globular cluster numbers
are conserved during mergers so the larger galaxy gains the globulars from the
smaller galaxies that it consumed
Figure 4 shows some results of Monte Carlo simulations based on the Cote
et al 1998 2000 model Our simulations indicate that 80 to 90 of large ellip-
tical galaxies formed in this way exhibit bimodal or in some cases multimodal
globular cluster distributions The locations of the metal-rich and metal-poor
peaks also agree well with observations compare Figures 1 and 4 In our model
Figure 4
Results from some simulations based on the dissipationless
merger model of Cote Marzke  West 1998 These simulations show
that bimodal globular cluster metallicity distributions are easily pro-
duced by dissipationless galaxy mergers and accretion without needing
to posit the formation of multiple bursts of globular cluster formation
Galaxy Deconstruction
the metal-rich globular clisuters of large ellipticals belonged to the progenitor
galaxy seed and the metal-poor globulars were inherited from the many smaller
galaxies that it consumed during its growth or by accretion of intergalactic
globulars that were torn from other galaxies The globulars gained from merg-
ers or accretion are predominantly metal-poor because they originate mostly in
low-mass galaxies
It is noteworthy that unimodal globular cluster metallicity distributions
also occur from time to time in our model An example can be seen in Figure
4 This is not surprising given the stochastic nature of the merger process For
instance a large elliptical could in principle be built by merging many small
dwarf galaxies resulting in the globular cluster metallicity distribution of the
nal merger remnant exhibiting a single metal-poor peak or by merging two
or three medium-sized galaxies which might lead to a single metal-rich peak
or by merging galaxies over a wide range of luminosities which yields bimodal
or multimodal globular cluster metallicity distributions
Unfortunately our model seems to often be misunderstood or misrepre-
sented in the literature For example claims that the Cote et al 1998 2000
model is ruled out by the discovery of bimodality in some low-luminosity ellipti-
cals eg Forte et al 2001 Kundu  Whitmore 2001 are completely unfounded
Cote et al 2000 demonstrated that it is quite straightforward to reproduce the
bimodal globular cluster metallicity distribution of our own Galactic spheroid
which has MV  199 as a consequence of accretion and mergers and hence
the same should be true for intermediate- and low-luminosity elliptical galaxies
Similarly recent assertions that the location of the metal-poor globular cluster
peak also correlates weakly with parent galaxy luminosity is not hard to explain
within the accretionmerger pictures Larsen et al 2001 A careful reading
of the original Cote West  Marzke 1998 paper would show that in fact we
predict this very result see Section 312 of that paper which states there is a
slight tendency for the brighter gEs to capture globular cluster populations that
are more metal-rich than those accreted by their fainter counterparts since the
brighter gEs are able to accommodate the capture of more luminous intruder
galaxies
If our model is correct then it oers the exciting possibility of placing some
quantitative constraints on the number and types of mergers that galaxies have
experienced over their lifetimes by comparing the relative numbers of metal-rich
and metal-poor globulars that they possess Cote et al 1998 used this rea-
soning to conclude that M49 the most luminous elliptical galaxy in the Virgo
cluster must have gained roughly 23 of its present luminosity by consuming
other smaller Virgo galaxies More recently we have applied these same tech-
niques to understanding the formation of our own Milky Way galaxy Cote et al
2000 showed that the present-day globular cluster system of the Milky Way
strongly suggests that the Galaxys spheroid was assembled from a large number
of metal-poor protogalactic fragments Hence even a relatively low luminosity
system like the Milky Way spheroid can and does possess a bimodal distribution
of globular cluster metallicities
Galaxy Deconstruction
3 Where do we go from here
Clearly the competing theories for the origin of bimodal globular cluster metallic-
ity distributions make quite dierent predictions regarding the ages of globulars
If the metal-poor and metal-rich globulars surrounding large elliptical galaxies
are the result of multiple bursts of cluster formation then the two populations
should have quite dierent ages If on the other hand bimodal metallicity dis-
tributions can be explained by dissipationless merging as described above then
the metal-poor and metal-rich globulars should all be old
Recently Beasley et al 2000 measured ages and metallicities of globu-
lar clusters in M49 and concluded that within the sizeable uncertainties the
metal-poor and metal-rich populations are coeval and old This clearly seems
to support the Cote et al 1998 2000 picture However more precise data are
needed to reduce the uncertainties before rm conclusions can be drawn With
that goal we have obtained Hubble Space Telescope observations of  103 globu-
lar clusters associated with the giant elliptical galaxy M87 in order to accurately
determine their ages using a powerful narrow-band photometry technique
The hypothesis that galaxies might accrete substantial numbers of inter-
galactic globular clusters also needs to be tested with direct observations of
these objects to determine if they really exist and in what numbers Unlike
many theories for the origin of globular cluster populations the intergalactic
globulars hypothesis is easily falsiable if a signicant population of intergalac-
tic globulars is not detected in the cores of galaxy clusters then this idea will
have to be abandoned My collaborators and I are currently analyzing HST
Keck Subaru and CFHT images that we obtained to search for intergalactic
globulars in the Virgo Coma and Abell 1185 galaxy clusters
There is also work to be done on the theoretical front The simple merger
model described here is admittedly somewhat naive For example we assumed
equal merger probabilities for all galaxies when in reality there is likely to
be some mass dependence of merging As a step towards more realistic models
Frazer Pearce and I are collaborating in a study of the merger histories of galaxies
that form in very high-resolution N-body cosmological simulations By following
the detailed merger histories of galaxies from high redshifts to the present and
inputting simple models of globular cluster formation at dierent epochs we
will be able to make quantitative predictions regarding the evolution of globular
cluster metallicity distributions in galaxies as a function of time

Discussion
Michael Rich I support your view in fact in the Milky Way there are old
metal-rich globular clusters in the bulge and as I mentioned in my talk when
you age-date them they seem to be rather old  at least of order 13Gyr We
have a white dwarf distance modulus distance to 47 Tuc which gives a 13Gyr
age and then we can compare 6528 and 6553 to that and we think that these
red globular clusters were formed along with the Galactic bulge very early in
the history of the Galaxy So I think that red cluster systems have to do with
the formation of the bulge Now is the bulge formed in a merger event Maybe
the simulations show these very early mergers On the other hand black hole
mass is correlated with bulge velocity dispersion and black holes are very early
galaxy formation events So I dont know but I would tend to support the view
that the red clusters were formed in the metal-rich spheroid
West Thanks Pat Cote Ron Marke Dante Minniti and I published a paper
just last year in which we showed that one can account for the properties of the
Milky Way spheroid and its globular cluster system if it consumed upwards of
103 little dwarf galaxies during its formation
Hugh Harris The clusters are usually found more widely distributed spatially
than the halo light in their galaxy How do you interpret that
West We think that accretion not just mergers has probably played an im-
portant role by stripping globular clusters from some galaxies and then adding
these to the outer regions of others especially giant ellipticals in the centers
of rich clusters This would explain why some of large ellipticals like M87 for
example have far more globulars per unit galaxy luminosity than expected and
why they have very extended distributions
Alan Stockton The problem with making large bulges or large ellipticals from
a lot of small things of course is the luminosity-color relation or luminosity-
metallicity relation So you indicated in most cases you favor starting with a
fairly large progenitor and then putting a bunch of small things on it Do you
still run into any problem with the observed dispersion in that relation
West One can imagine making a large elliptical in many dierent ways either
from the merger of many small dwarfs in which case the elliptical should be
pretty blue as well or from a number of bigger progenitors which would have
had redder colors The existence of the observed luminosity-color relation for
galaxies suggests that in most cases large ellipticals cant have formed just from
the merger of many dwarfs  that probably wouldnt work youre right
suggests that most large ellipticals must have started from fairly large progenitor
seeds As this seed galaxy consumes smaller neighbors this will dilute the
luminosity-color relation but wont necessarily obliterate it
