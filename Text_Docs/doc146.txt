ABSTRACT
Hubble Space Telescope1 B and I images are presented of 32 galaxies with secure
redshifts in the range 05  z  12 from the Canada-France Redshift Survey a
complete sample of galaxies with 175  IAB  225 These galaxies exhibit the same
range of morphological types as seen locally ie ellipticals spirals and irregulars The
galaxies look far less regular in the B images rest-frame ultraviolet than at longer
wavelengths underlining the fact that optical images of galaxies at still higher redshift
should be interpreted with caution
Quantitative analyses of the galaxies yield disk sizes bulge fractions and
colors for each component At these redshifts galaxy disks show clear evidence
for surface brightness evolution The mean rest-frame central surface brightness
of the disks of normal late-type galaxies is ABB  202  025 mag arcsec2
about 12 magnitudes brighter than the Freeman 1970 value Some degree of
peculiarityasymmetry is measurable in 10 30 of the galaxies and 4 13
show clear signs of interactionmergers There are 9 galaxies 30 dominated by
blue compact components These components which appear to be related to star
formation occur most often in peculiarasymmetric galaxies some of which appear
to be interacting but a few are in otherwise normal galaxies Thus of the galaxies
bluer than present-day Sb one-third are blue nucleated galaxies and half are
late-type galaxies with disks which are signicantly brighter than normal galaxies at
z  0 Taken together these two eects must be responsible for much of the observed
evolution of the luminosity function of blue galaxies

INTRODUCTION
The spatial resolution of HST images makes it possible to recognize the same features that are
familiar from studies of nearby galaxies in objects as distant as redshift z  1 corresponding to a
lookback time of 23o for 
  1 HST imaging is thus a powerful tool that can help distinguish
between competing explanations of eld galaxy evolution eg widespread merging Broadhurst
Ellis and Glazebrook 1992 fading low-mass populations Babul and Rees 1992 dierential
luminosity evolution or any combination thereof see Lilly 1993 for a review
Several studies of the eld galaxy population with HST are in progress but no clear picture
has yet emerged eg Mutz et al 1994 Koo et al 1994 Forbes et al 1994 Griths et al 1994a
b Glazebrook et al 1995 One of the diculties in interpreting the data has been the lack of
complete redshift data for the observed samples Redshifts are essential since for example at
IAB  225 galaxies span a factor of ten in redshift from z  01 to z  1 and thus exhibit
an enormous range of luminosity scale size and epoch The morphologies of large numbers of
faint galaxies revealed on the HST images can be investigated but their interpretation relies on
modelling and extrapolating data from the local population The approach adopted in this Letter
involves the analysis of a sample drawn from a complete redshift survey whose selection properties
are well-determined In this case the luminosities rest-frame colors spectral energy distributions
and scale sizes in physical units are all known allowing a more direct interpretation of the results
The Canada-France Redshift Survey CFRS contains spectra of a statistically complete
magnitude-limited sample of 943 objects with 175  IAB  225 see Le Fevre et al 1995 CFRS
II Crampton et al 1995 CFRS V and references therein Four HST pointings in F450W B
and F814W I in the 030000 Hammer et al 1995 CFRS IV and 141552Lilly et al 1995b
CFRS III CFRS elds were obtained with integration times of 6000s each in 1994 November
and December The PC was pointed at random z  06 galaxies with the result that images were
obtained for 45 galaxies with secure redshifts 0  z  12 one QSO at z  16 8 stars and 3
objects for which the CFRS spectra did not yield secure spectroscopic identications The HST
photometric zeropoints were adopted and found to be in good agreement to 01 mag with the
ground-based photometry Lilly et al 1995a CFRS I Rest-frame U  V AB colors and B-band
luminosities were derived from the observed magnitudes and redshifts interpolating among the
spectral energy distributions of Coleman Wu and Weedman 1980 as described by Lilly et al
1995b CFRS VI
This Letter analyzes the images of the subsample of 32 galaxies with secure redshifts z  047
Of the three spectroscopically unidentied galaxies two of them are likely to lie at z  05 on
the basis of tentative redshifts derived from their spectra and their colors see Crampton et al
1995 CFRS V but these two galaxies have morphologies similar to those of the identied galaxies
and their exclusion is unlikely to bias the sample signicantly The qualitative properties of the
galaxies in our sample are discussed in x2 Quantitative analyses of the light proles are described
in x3 and a discussion of the results in x4 It is assumed that H  50 km sec1 Mpc1 and
q  05 throughout
2 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF HIGH REDSHIFT GALAXIES
Figures 1-2 plates XXX show images of the 32 CFRS galaxies with 05  z  12 observed
with HST At these redshifts I is equivalent to rest-frame B or V so that direct visual comparisons
can be made with local galaxies The B band samples the rest-frame ultraviolet region shortward
of 2900 A The galaxies are arranged from the top left in order of rest-frame U  V  color bluer
toward the right and rest-frame blue luminosity decreasing downward Identication and details
of all the galaxies are listed in Table 1 Pseudo true-color images produced by combining the two
images are shown in Figure 3 plate XXX
Many of the galaxies in Figures 1-3 have close counterparts in the Hubble Atlas of Galaxies
Sandage 1961 eg cf 140393 to M101 Spiral structure is visually apparent in ve galaxies
and obvious irregular structure in several Among those objects that appear to have normal
disk-plus-bulge morphology most have component colors consistent with what is found locally
ie redder bulge bluer disk eg 141043 140854 140393 However nine of the galaxies eg
031540 and 140985 appear to have blue central concentrations The frequency of asymmetric
or irregular structure increases at low luminosity Companions within 25 h1
05 kpc are seen in
ve cases If merging galaxies are dened as those objects with high surface-brightness irregular
structure accompanied by low surface brightness asymmetric tidal features then there are four
cases of mergers 140972 141139 030488 031540
As anticipated the galaxies look much less regular in the B images rest-frame ultraviolet
For example 141043 appears to be a normal early-type spiral in the I band image whereas it
shows two equal surface-brightness components in the B frame 030445 is unclassiable in the B
image although it is a regular spiral in I Many of the galaxies which look irregularpeculiar
in the B images would be characterized as normal in the I images This emphasizes the severe
diculties involved in interpreting optical images of galaxies at z 1
3 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES
Two fundamental properties of a galaxy are its size and morphological type These quantitites
were estimated by tting bulge-plus-disk models to symmetric I images of the galaxies
generated in the following way see eg Elmegreen Elmegreen  Montenegro 1992 An
asymmetric image was rst constructed by rotating the original image about the galaxy center
and subtracting this from the original image The resulting frame was clipped to exclude positive
structure less signicant than 2 and then subtracted from the original giving an image from
which strong asymmetric structures have been removed A 2 minimization procedure Schade et
al 1995 was used to determine the best t disk scale length bulge eective radius and surface
brightness inclination and orientation for each component Structural parameters were derived
from the I image and component colors were determined by scaling the surface brightness of the
bulge and disk separately holding structural parameters xed until a satisfactory t to the B
image was achieved The rest-frame colors and luminosities were determined for the bulge and
disk components individually Using these colors the nal bulge fraction BT  was dened in
rest-frame B
The best-t model was subtracted from the original image and residual structure measured
using indices which estimate the remaining ux Dening Iij as the original image and Rij and
ij as the residual original minus model image and its counterpart after a 180 degree rotation
RT  P 1
2jRij  R180
RA  P 1
2jRij  R180
The total and asymmetric indices RT and RA computed within a radius of 5 kpc are
approximately equal to the total and asymmetric residual ux respectively expressed as a fraction
of the total galaxy ux An object was classied asymmetric if RT  RA  014 In practical
terms most objects with RA  5 of the galaxy ux are classied as asymmetric
4 RESULTS
41 Color versus morphology
The local galaxy population exhibits well-dened relations between integrated color and
morphological type eg Buta et al 1994 due largely to the varying proportions of bulge
red and disk bluer luminosity as a function of Hubble type Since the bulgetotal luminosity
BT  correlates with Hubble type a variation of BT with color is expected Figure 4 shows
the color-morphology relation for the 32 high redshift galaxies The symbols indicate integrated
U  V  restframe colors and BT  and the arrows show the colors of the corresponding bulge
and disk components Open symbols indicate those galaxies classied as asymmetricpeculiar
The expected galaxy sequences are present in this diagram Early-type galaxies populate the
quadrant U  V AB  14 BT  05 There is a group of disk-dominated galaxies with
U  V AB  14 BT  05 Note however that there are nine galaxies with decomposed colors
dashed arrows indicating blue compact components unlike those in normal galaxy sequences
Although we refer to decomposition into bulges these components are sometimes not centered
in the galaxies and so we refer to these galaxies as blue nucleated galaxies BNGs The
association of asymmetricpeculiar structure open symbols with the BNG phemomenon dashed
arrows is clear
42 Blue nucleated galaxies
Among the nine BNGs three show clear indications of interactionmerging based on the
presence of high surface brightness irregular structure in addition to the presence of low surface
brightness asymmetric presumably tidally-induced structure Seven of the nine BNG objects are
asymmetricpeculiar as measured by our objective residual indices A test of these correlations
using a four-fold table Sachs 1984 indicates that the associations of merginginteraction and
asymmetric structure with the BNG phenomenon are signicant at the 97 and 999 level of
condence respectively These associations suggest that these are not simply blue bulges it seems
more likely that they are associated with starburst phenomena Measurements of the OIIH
and OIIIH ratios from our spectra indicate that BNGs are the result of star formation rather
than an AGN-related phenomenon
43 Disk surface brightness
Figure 5 shows the relationship between disk luminosity and scale length The solid circles
show disks of galaxies with BT  05 and open circles those of galaxies with BT  075
Asymmetric galaxies as dened in x3 have been excluded For comparison equivalent data
from Kent 1985 small open squares and van der Kruit 1987 small open triangles have also
been plotted converted to BAB  B  02 The dotted line represents the Freeman 1970
constant surface brightness law If the z  0 locus dened by Freemans law is correct and it
is supported by the two datasets shown then this sample of disk galaxies at z  05 shows
strong evolution in rest-frame central surface brightness The mean rest-frame value excluding
irregular and bulge-dominated galaxies and corrected for inclination is ABB  202  025 mag
arcsec2 approximately 12 magnitudes nearly 5 brighter than the Freeman value Galaxies
showing obvious spiral structure have a mean AB B  201  02 small featureless objects have
ABB  1973  05 and irregular objects where the meaning of the tted disk central surface
brightness may be questionable have ABB  2055 08 Thus there is no signicant dierence
in ABB among these subsamples and therefore no evidence that the observed surface brightness
evolution is dependent upon a galaxys membership in an easily recognized Hubble class nor
even upon its degree of regularity It should be noted that surface brightness measurements are
independent of q
5 DISCUSSION
Three conclusions follow from the present observations First the galaxy population at
z  075 is broadly similar to the local galaxy population The same range in morphological
properties is apparent and all present-day galaxy types are represented The basic similarity
of the high-redshift and local populations indicates that exotic evolutionary processes do not
dominate luminous galaxy evolution
Second in addition to populations that are normal in the context of the color-morphology
relation there exist blue nucleated galaxies BNGs 30 of the sample which are predominantly
associated with asymmetric structure and in a few cases with obvious interactionsmergers
Because the BNGs represent 35 of the blue galaxy population whose luminosity function is
known to be strongly evolving Lilly et al 1995b they must play a signicant role in that
evolution
Finally the average central surface brightness of the disks of normal late-type galaxies
BT  05 is higher by 12  025 magnitudearcsec2 than in the local population If it is
assumed that disk sizes have been constant then this represents the second major component of
the observed evolution in the luminosity function of blue galaxies since they represent 50 of
the blue galaxies The surface brightness enhancement is seen in galaxies dominated by regular
bulge-plus-disk structure with clear spiral arms and also in irregular and compact objects 15 of
the blue galaxies are asymmetricpeculiar and are not BNGs but show high disk central surface
brightness These results imply that the majority of disk galaxies at z  075 are forming stars
over much of the extent of their disks at a rate of 2-3 times higher than the local average rate
An order of magnitude increase in sample size is required to provide denitive estimates of
the distribution of morphological types and the frequency of bars spiral structure merging and
the BNG phenomomen Even the small sample analysed here however illustrates the enormous
power of HST resolution combined with necessary redshift information to allow us to see the
distant universe in terms that are comparable to the way we observe the universe locally
