Abstract Metallicity appears to be one the most important tool to study the formation
and evolution of galaxies Recently we have shown that metallicity of local galaxies is
tightly related not only to stellar mass but also to star formation rate SFR At low stellar
mass metallicity decreases sharply with increasing SFR while at high stellar mass metal-
licity does not depend on SFR The residual metallicity dispersion across this Fundamental
Metallicity Relation FMR is very small about 005 dex High redshift galaxies up to
z25 are found to follow the same FMR dened by local SDSS galaxies with no indi-
cation of evolution At z25 evolution of about 06 dex o the FMR is observed with
high-redshift galaxies showing lower metallicities This result can be combined with our
recent discover of metallicity gradients in three high redshift galaxies showing disk dynam-
ics In these galaxies the regions with higher SFR also show lower metallicities Both these
evidences can be explained by the eect of smooth infall of gas into previously enriched
galaxies with the star-formation activity triggered by the infalling gas

and many dierent explanations have been
proposed including ejection of metal-enriched
gas eg Edmunds 1990 Lehnert  Heckman

of star

The mass-metallicity relation has been
studied by Erb et al 2006 at z22 and
by Maiolino et al 2008 and Mannucci et al
2009 at z34 nding a strong and mono-
tonic evolution with metallicity decreasing
with redshift at a given mass see g1 The
same authors Erb et al 2006 Erb 2008
Mannucci et al 2009 have also studied the re-
lation between metallicity and gas fraction ie

the importance of infall in high redshift galax-

tinction as estimated from the Balmer decre-
ment The conversion factor between H lu-
minosity and SFR in Kennicutt 1998 was
used corrected to a Chabrier 2003 IMF
Oxygen gas-phase abundances were measured
from the emission line ratios as described in
Maiolino et al 2008 An average between
the values obtain from NII6584H and
R23OII3727OIII49585007H was
used The nal galaxy sample contains 141825
galaxies
The grey-shaded area in the left panel
of Fig 2 shows the mass-metallicity relation
for our sample of SDSS galaxies Despite
the dierences in the selection of the sample
and in the measure of metallicity our results
are very similar to what has been found by
Tremonti et al 2004 The metallicity disper-
sion of our sample 008 dex is somewhat
smaller to what have been found by these au-
thors 010 dex possibly due to dierent sam-
ple selections and metallicity calibration
The left panel of Fig 2 also shows as a
function of M the median metallicities of
SDSS galaxies having dierent levels of SFR
It is evident that a systematic segregation in
SFR is present in the data While galaxies with
high M logM109 show no correlation
between metallicity and SFR at low M more
active galaxies also show lower metallicity
The same systematic dependence of metallic-
ity on SFR can be seen in the right panel of
Fig 2 where metallicity is plotted as a function
of SFR for dierent values of mass Galaxies
with high SFRs show a sharp dependence of
metallicity on SFR while less active galaxies
show a less pronounced dependence
The dependence of metallicity on M and
SFR can be better visualized in a 3D space with
these three coordinates as shown in Figure 3
SDSS galaxies appear to dene a tight sur-
face in the space the Fundamental Metallicity
Relation FMR The introduction of the FMR
results in a signicant reduction of residual
metallicity scatter with respect to the simple
mass-metallicity relation The dispersion of in-
dividual SDSS galaxies around the FMR is

2 The local Fundamental Metallicity
Relation
To test the hypothesis of a correlation between
SFR and metallicity in the present universe and
at high redshift we have studied several sam-
ples of galaxies at dierent redshifts whose
metallicity M and SFR have been measured
A full description of the data set is given in
Mannucci et al 2010
Local galaxies are well measured by the
SDSS project Abazajian et al 2009 Among
the  106 galaxies with observed spectra
we selected star forming objects with red-
shift between 007 and 030 having a signal-
to-noise ratio SNR of H of SNR25 and
dust extinction AV  25 Total stellar
masses M from Kaumann et al 2003 were
used scaled to the Chabrier 2003 initial

Fig 2 Left panel The mass-metallicity relation of local SDSS galaxies The grey-shaded areas contain
64 and 90 of all SDSS galaxies with the thick central line showing the median relation The col-
ored lines show the median metallicities as a function of M of SDSS galaxies with dierent values of
SFR Right panel median metallicity as a function of SFR for galaxies of dierent M At all M with
logM107 metallicity decreases with increasing SFR at constant mass 
006 dex when computed across the full FMR
and reduces to 005 dex ie about 12 in the
central part of the relation where most of the
galaxies are found The nal scatter is consis-
tent with the intrinsic uncertainties in the mea-
sure of metallicity 003 dex for the calibra-
tion to be added to the uncertainties in the line
ratios on mass estimated to be 009 dex by
Tremonti et al 2004 and on the SFR which
are dominated by the uncertainties on dust ex-
tinction
The reduction in scatter with respect to the
mass-metallicity relation becomes even more
signicant when considering that most of the
galaxies in the sample cover a small range
in SFR with 64 of the galaxies 1 is
contained inside 08 dex The mass-metallicity
relation is not an adequate representation of
galaxy samples with a larger spread of SFRs
as usually nd at intermediate redshifts
3 The FMR at high-redshift
The local galaxies can be compared with
several samples of high-redshift objects We
extracted from the literature samples of
galaxies in four
for a to-
redshift bins

ues of emission line uxes M and dust

The same procedure used for the SDSS galax-
ies was applied to these galaxies
Galaxies at all redshifts follow well dened
mass-metallicity relations see for example
Mannucci et al 2009 and references therein
For this reason each of these samples except
the one an z33 that contains 16 objects only
is divided into two equally-numerous samples
of low- and high-M objects Median values
of M SFR and metallicities are computed for
each of these samples
Galaxies up to z25 follow the FMR de-
ned locally with no sign of evolution This
is an unexpected result as simultaneously the
mass-metallicity relation is observed to evolve
rapidly with redshift see Fig1 The solution
of this apparent paradox is that distant galaxies

Fig 3 Three projections of the Fundamental Metallicity Relation among M SFR and gas-phase metal-
licity Circles without error bars are the median values of metallicity of local SDSS galaxies in bin of M
and SFR color-coded with SFR as shown in the colorbar on the right These galaxies dene a tight surface
in the 3D space with dispersion of single galaxies around this surface of 005 dex The black dots show
a second-order t to these SDSS data extrapolated toward higher SFR Square dots with error bars are the
median values of high redshift galaxies as explained in the text Labels show the corresponding redshifts
The projection in the lower-left panel emphasizes that most of the high-redshift data except the point at
z33 are found on the same surface dened by low-redshift data The projection in the lower-right panel
corresponds to the mass-metallicity relation as in Fig 2 showing that the origin of the observed evolution
in metallicity up to z25 is due to the progressively increasing SFR
have on average larger SFRs and therefore
fall in a dierent part of the same FMR
In the SDSS sample metallicity changes
more with M 05 dex from one extreme to
the other at constant SFR see Fig 2 than with
SFR 030 dex at constant mass Therefore
mass is the main driver of the level of chem-
ical enrichment of SDSS galaxies This is re-
lated to the fact that galaxies with high SFRs
the objects showing the strongest dependence
of metallicity on SFR see the right panel of
g 2 are quite rare in the local universe At
high redshifts mainly active galaxies are se-
lected and the dependence of metallicity on
SFR becomes dominant
Galaxies at z33 show metallicities lower
of about 06 dex with respect to both the FMR
dened by the SDSS sample and galaxies at
05z25 This is an indication that some evo-
lution of the FMR appears at z25 although
its size can be aected several potential bi-
ases see Mannucci et al 2010 for a full dis-
cussion A larger data set at z3 is needed to
solve this question
4 What the FMR is telling us
The interpretation of these results must take
into account several eects
In principle
metallicity is a simple quantity as it is domi-
nated by three processes star formation infall
outow If the scaling laws of each of these
three processes are known the dependence of
metallicity on SFR and M can be predicted
In practice these three processes have a very
complex dependence of the properties of the
galaxies and can introduce scaling relations in
many dierent ways First it is not known how
outows due to either SNe or AGNs depend
on the properties of the galaxies Second in-
falls of pristine gas are expected to inuence
metallicity in two ways metallicity can be re-
duced by the direct accretion of metal-poor
gas and can be increased by the star forma-
tion activity which is likely to follow accretion
Third the star formation activity is known to
depend on galaxy mass with heavier galaxies
forming a larger fraction of stars at higher red-
shifts and this eect produce higher metallici-
ties in more massive galaxies
The dependence of metallicity on SFR can
be explained by the dilution eect of the in-

their dispersion around the FMR All the galaxy samples up to z25 are consistent with no evolution of the
FMR dened locally Metallicities lower by 06 dex are observed at z33
falling gas A simple model can be constructed
see Mannucci et al 2010 where a variable
amount of metal-poor infalling gas forming
stars according to the Schmidt-Kennicutt law
can explain the dependence of metallicity on
SFR For this scenario to work the timescales
of chemical enrichment must be longer than
the dynamical scales of the galaxies over
which the SFR is expected to evolve In other
words galaxies on the FMR are in a tran-
sient phase after an infall galaxies rst evolve
towards higher SFR and lower metallicities
Later while gas is converted into stars and new
metals are produced either galaxies drop out
of the sample because they have faint H or
evolve toward higher values of mass and metal-
licities along the FMR In this scenario the de-
pendence of metallicity on SFR is due to infall
and dominates at high redshifts where galaxies
with massive infalls and large SFRs are found
In contrast in the local universe such galaxies
are rare most of the galaxies have low level
of accretion and abundances are dominated by
the dependence on mass possibly due to out-
In many local galaxies
timescales of
chemical enrichment can be shorter than the
other relevant
timescales eg Silk 1993
and galaxies can be in a quasi steady-state
situation in which gas infall star formation
and metal ejection occur
simultaneously
Bouche et al 2009 Assuming this quasi
steady-state situation
in which infall and
SFR are slowly evolving with respect to the
timescale of chemical enrichment
be shown Mannucci et al 2010 that our
results support a scenario where outows are
inversely proportional to mass and increase
with SFR065
The small scatter of SDSS galaxies around
the FMR can be used to constrain the charac-
teristics of gas accretion For this infalloutow
scenario to work and produce a very small scat-
ter round the FMR two conditions are simulta-
neously required 1 star formation is always
associated to the same level of metallicity dilu-

tion due to infall of metal-poor gas 2 there is
a relation between the amount of infalling and
outowing gas and the level of star formation
These conditions for the existence of the FMR
ts into the smooth accretion models proposed
by several groups Bournaud  Elmegreen
2009 Dekel et al 2009 where continuos in-
fall of pristine gas is the main driver of the
grow of galaxies In this case metal-poor gas
is continuously accreted by galaxies and con-
verted in stars and a long-lasting equilibrium
between gas accretion star formation and
metal ejection is expected to established
5 Abundance gradients in
high-redshift galaxies
Recently Cresci et al 2010 we have ob-
tained a direct evidence of the presence of
smooth accretion of gas in high redshift galax-
We selected three Lyman-break galaxies
among the AMAZE Maiolino et al 2008
and LSD Mannucci et al 2009 samples
which show a remarkably symmetric velocity
eld in the OIII emission line which traces
the ionized gas kinematics see Fig 4 Such
kinematics indicates that these are rotation-
ally supported disks Gnerucci et al in prepa-
ration with no evidence for more complex
merger-induced dynamics Near-infrared spec-
troscopic observations of the galaxies were
obtained with the integral eld spectrometer
SINFONI on VLT and we used the ux ra-
tios between the main rest-frame optical lines
to obtain the metallicity map shown in Fig 4
An unresolved region with lower metallicity
is evident in each map surrounded by a more
uniform disk of higher metal content In one
case CDFa-C9 the lower metallicity region
is coincident with the galaxy center as traced
by the continuum peak while it is oset by
 060 46 kpc in SS22a-C16 and  045
34 kpc in SS22a-M38 On the other hand
in all the galaxies the area of lower metal-
licity is coincident or closer than 025 19
kpc half of the PSF FWHM to the regions
of enhanced line emission tracing the more
active star forming regions The average dif-
ference between high and low metallicity re-
gions in the three galaxies is 055 in units of
12logOH larger than the  02  04 dex
gradients measured in the Milky Way and other
local spirals van Zee et al 1998 on the same
spatial scales The measured gas phase abun-
dance variations have a signicance between
98 and 998  It can be shown Cresci et al
2010 that variations of ionization parame-
ter across the galaxies cannot explain the ob-
served gradients of line ratios and that dier-
ent metallicities are really requested
Current models of chemical enrichment
in galaxies Molla et al 1997 cannot repro-
duce our observations at the moment as they
assume radially isotropic gas accretion onto
the disk and the instantaneous recycling ap-
proximation Nevertheless the detected gra-
dients can be explained in the framework of
the cold gas accretion scenario Keres et al
2005 recently proposed to explain the proper-
ties of gas rich rotationally supported galaxies
observed at high redshift Cresci et al 2009
Forster Schreiber et al 2009 In this scenario
the observed low metallicity regions are cre-
ated by the local accretion of metal-poor gas
in clumpy streams Dekel et al 2009 pene-
trating deep onto the galaxy following the po-
tential well and sustaining the observed high
star formation rate in the pre-enriched disk
Stream-driven turbulence is then responsible
for the fragmentation of the disks into giant
clumps as observed at z  2 Genzel et al
2008 Mannucci et al 2009 that are the sites
of ecient star formation and possibly the pro-
genitors of the central spheroid This scenario
is also in agreement with the dynamical prop-
erties of our sample which appears to be dom-
inated by gas rotation in a disk with no evi-
dence of the dynamical asymmetries typically
induced by mergers The study of the rela-
tions between metallicity gas fractions eec-
tive yields and SFR Cresci et al 2010 show
that the low-metallicity regions can be well
explained by amounts of infalling gas much
larger than in the remaining high-metallicity
regions
Our observations of low metallicity regions
in these three galaxies at z  3 therefore pro-
vide the evidence for the actual presence of
accretion of metal-poor gas in massive high-
