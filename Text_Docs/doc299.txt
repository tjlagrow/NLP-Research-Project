ABSTRACT Contribution to the gamma-ray background GRB by galaxies bright in the far-
IR FIR is discussed Using observational correlations between the FIR and synchrotron emission
in radio wavelengths it is shown that the concentration of cosmic ray electrons in FIR luminous
galaxies is substantially higher than in the general population of galaxies Microwave background
and intrinsic galaxy radiation scattered via the inverse Compton IC eect by cosmic ray electrons
into high energies makes the FIR galaxies relatively strong gamma-ray sources in comparison with
normal galaxies Using the FIR galaxy luminosity function and the relationship between FIR and
radio luminosities the contribution due to the IC only of FIR luminous galaxies to the GRB
above  1 MeV is estimated at  10  to 25  depending on the rate of cosmic evolution of star
burst galaxies This is substantially larger than the normal galaxies contribution To obtain more
accurate assessment of relationship between the GRB and FIR galaxies gamma-ray observations
of individual galaxies bright in the FIR are required

1 INTRODUCTION
The origin of extragalactic diuse  radiation is unknown see Pohl 1998 for a recent
review and earlier references Various mechanisms producing the -ray background
GRB have been proposed They include rather exotic processes like annihilation
of miscellaneous particles formed in the early universe Rudaz  Stecker 1991 or
evaporation of primordial micro-black-holes Page  Hawking 1976 as well as a
superposition of large number of AGNs However spectra of ordinary Seyfert
galaxies fall steeply above  100 keV and these objects contribute mostly to the
diuse background below  50 keV Johnson et al 1994 The most promising
candidate producing the GRB above 10 MeV seem to be BL Lac objects Several
dozen blazars have been detected by EGRET and some of them are also strong
sources at COMPTEL energies von Montigny et al 1995 Mukherjee et al 1997
Quantitative estimates of the blazar contribution to the GRB rely on the specula-
tive assumptions on the -ray evolution and vary between 20 and 90  eg Mucke
 Pohl 1998 Sreekumar et al 1997 and references therein In the present paper
we discuss -ray emission by galaxies luminous in the far-infrared FIR domain
and the potential role of these objects for the GRB We calculate the production of
-rays by cosmic ray electrons scattering low energy photons Energetic electrons
produce the -rays a interacting with the interstellar medium Bremsstrahlung
and b scattering o the cosmic microwave background CMB and intrinsic galaxy
radiation via the inverse Compton IC process Although Skibo  Ramaty 1993
estimate that the former process dominates in the -ray band we restrict our in-
vestigation to the IC mechanism only This is because IC calculations are subject
to smaller uncertainties But one should note that the total contribution of the FIR
galaxies to the GRB likely exceeds the gures obtained in the paper
2 COSMIC-RAY ELECTRONS IN FIR GALAXIES
The dominant component of radio emission in galaxies is synchrotron radiation by
cosmic ray electrons moving in the magnetic eld which lls the interstellar space
If the electron energy spectrum has the power law form N E  NEp using
standard formulae eg Rybicki  Lightman 1979 one can get
P   119  1033 N b175 075
erg s1Hz1 
where b  B5G B is the strength of magnetic eld 9 is radiation frequency in
GHz and we have put p  25 Galaxies with a high star formation rate starburst
galaxies are bright in the far infrared They are also rich in cosmic rays what makes
them relatively bright radio sources The observational correlation between the
luminosities in these two domains can be tted using the power law approximation
Chi  Wolfendale 1990
log P149  117 log LFIR  997
where P149 is a luminosity in W Hz1 at   149 GHz and LFIR is the luminosity
in solar units integrated from 40 to 120 m Since there is a dependence of B on
LFIR Chi  Wolfendale 1990 B  L0125
FIR  Eq 1 and 2 could be combined to
give the relationship between the LFIR and the normalization of cosmic ray electron
distribution
N  167  1052 L095
These cosmic ray electrons produce the -ray photons via the IC process on the
radiation eld in the galaxy In eect the most luminous FIR galaxies of LFIR 
1012 L become also strong -ray sources with luminosities at 10 MeV of L  31 
1038erg s1MeV1
3 THE GAMMA-RAY BACKGROUND
The total number of cosmic ray electrons in FIR galaxies within 1 Mpc3 is given
by the integral over the FIR luminosity function and the corresponding local lu-
minosity density at 10 MeV produced via the IC eect by these electrons L 
14  1040 MeVs MeV Mpc3 One can calculate the intensity of the X-ray back-
ground XRB and GRB produced by the luminosity density taking into account

symbols have their usual meaning

Evolution of the luminosity density LE z results from the dependence of the
CMB temperature on redshift evolution of the FIR radiation eld and the variations
of the cosmic electron concentration in galaxies In Fig 1 we show the predicted
background for selected models Crosses denote the background produced by scat-
tering of CMB photons only assuming no evolution of cosmic ray electrons At
10 MeV the model produces roughly 05  of the observed background However
it is likely that the population of galaxies luminous in the FIR is subject to strong
evolution The redshift distribution of IRAS galaxies eg Saunders et al 1990 is
consistent with the density evolution  1  z6723 for z  025 Samples are not
deep enough to provide direct information on the FIR evolution at higher redshits
but it is generally accepted that starburst galaxies which are the major constituent
of the FIR galaxies exhibit a strong increase of the spatial density andor luminos-
ity up to z  25 with a decay at higher redshifts eg Moorwood 1996 Franceschini
et al 1997 Bechtold et al 1998 In agreement with the available data we have
used the following parametrization of the evolution of the FIR luminosities
z  z 
z  z 
LFIRz  LFIR0 cid26 1  z
1  z expaz  z
where we put z  25 a  125 We have considerd two rates of evolution   25
and 30 The XRB and GRB produced by galaxies subjected to these evolution
models is shown in Fig 1 with open squares for   25 and with full squares for
  30 It is conspicuous that at energies above  5 MeV the model with   30
produces 20 - 25  of the observed background
4 PROSPECTS FOR THE FUTURE
Indirect methods which use objects selected at one energy band to predict the
background at another energy and exploit correlations between luminosities in these
two bands are not capable to provide accurate estimates of the background Studies
of the soft X-ray background in the last 20 years clearly show that However the
present calculations demonstrate that the FIR galaxies potentially are an important
constituent of the GRB To determine the contribution of these objects to the GRB
one should make direct observations in the -ray band of nearby IRAS sources 
known bright starburst galaxies Unfortunately prospects for the detection of these
galaxies in the -ray range with the present day instruments are discouraging This
is because in the present model a substantial fraction of the GRB is produced by
a large number of relatively weak -ray sources EGRET observations show that
some AGNs reach luminosities of 1047  1049 erg s1 von Montigny et al 1995
while in our model local -ray luminosities due to the IC process cover the range of
1036  1039 erg s1 The total -ray luminosities of FIR galaxies are most probably
substantialy larger because of the Bremsstrahlung but still are several orders of
magnitude below blazar luminosities However it is likely that the relatively high
spatial density of FIR galaxies makes them dominant contributors to the GRB
