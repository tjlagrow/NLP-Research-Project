Star forming dwarf galaxies

Abstract abstract
Star forming dwarf galaxies SFDGs have a high gas content and low metallic-
ities reminiscent of the basic entities in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios In
the young universe they probably also played a major role in the cosmic reioniza-
tion Their abundant presence in the local volume and their youthful character make
them ideal objects for detailed studies of the initial stellar mass function IMF fun-
damental star formation processes and its feedback to the interstellar medium Oc-
casionally we witness SFDGs involved in extreme starbursts giving rise to strongly
elevated production of super star clusters and global superwinds mechanisms yet to
be explored in more detail SFDGs is the initial state of all dwarf galaxies and the
relation to the environment provides us with a key to how different types of dwarf
galaxies are emerging In this review we will put the emphasis on the exotic star-
burst phase as it seems less important for present day galaxy evolution but perhaps
fundamental in the initial phase of galaxy formation
1 Introduction
Star forming dwarf galaxies SFDGs are characterized by low mass low chemi-
cal abundances high gas and dark matter DM content They constitute one of the
most common types of galaxies in the local universe eg 25 and increase in impor-
tance with redshift SFDGs reside in low density environments mostly with lack of
massive neighbors 165 166 In this review with focus on starburst dwarfs we will
consider a range of morphological types - SmIm dI gas rich low surface brightness

More than 70 of all galaxies in the local universe are SFDGs 66 Most of
these live a quiet family life and consume their gas at a slow pace eg 90 This
leads to a modest chemical enrichment in the low mass end probably further di-
luted by selective metal ejection by stellar winds or infall of fresh gas Occasionally
SFDGs go wild and enter a starburst phase but in most cases eventually return to
the quiescent phase without changing their properties radically Most of the basic
characteristics of SFDGs have been summarized in the review paper by Gallagher
III and Hunter 34
There is no commonly accepted denition of a dwarf galaxy In the traditional
sense 51 a dwarf refers to a galaxy of low luminosity and small size and low
surface brightness Sometimes only one of these criteria is used eg 59 126 154
Normally a magnitude limit of MB  16 is applied and this is useful under normal
conditions But gas rich galaxies can change the luminosity and surface brightness
drastically if they enter into a starburst phase violating both the luminosity and the
surface brightness criteria A mass constraint combined with a relative gas mass
fraction is probably the most relevant but hard to apply way of characterizing a
As is evident from studies of the local sample of SFDGs eg 42 148 158 165
the details of the star formation history SFH of SFDGs can be very different from
individual to individual Over long time scales it is controlled by feedback processes
111 and environmental inuences Starburst galaxies are rare and in the present
epoch do not signicantly inuence the evolution of star forming dwarfs as a type
12 35 90 On the individual level however starbursts may signicantly alter the
conditions momentarily although it seems unlikely that a major fraction of the gas
can be permanently expelled as a consequence of the supernovae winds and thus
transform a gas rich galaxy to a gas poor An increase in the star formation rate
SFR with a factor of 2-3 may be sustained over long time periods while it is unclear
if an extraordinary increase in SFR can survive over a time long enough to consume
a signicant fraction of the gas before it is quenched by feedback effects The major
difference between the bursting state and the normal one seems rather to be the
mode of star formation the tendency for stars to form in super star clusters SSCs
eg 1 111 and possibly switch to a atter IMF 45 139 164
Why is it interesting to study SFDGs In many respects these galaxies resemble
our notions of the fundamental building blocks of galaxies in the early universe
Very likely the rst dwarf population was the main driver of the cosmic reionization
Searches for Lyman continuum leakage from local SFDGs are therefore important
to better constrain the intergalactic ionization eld in the early days
Simulations of structure formation show that dwarfs merge into more massive
units Locally we can directly study this process and its effect on the star formation
morphology and gas content We can learn about star formation processes shocks
and chemical pollution The lack of shear and the slow rotation of low mass SFDGs
open for direct studies of the star formation processes and its evolution over long
time scales The rich variation in star formation histories SFHs and the frequent
occurrence of SFDGs in the local universe give us a wealth of information in great
detail The low dust content make them transparent and relatively easy to study
Star forming dwarf galaxies
Finally dwarfs help us to understand the nature of dark matter DM It is still a
puzzle why dwarfs have such a surprisingly low baryonDM ratio with respect to
the cosmic value 106
2 Recent surveys
Our understanding of SFDGs has drastically improved in recent years thanks to data
from space telescopes and large groundbased optical near-IR and radio telescopes
In particular the data from HST GALEX and 21-cm surveys have improved our
understanding of the formation and evolution of SFDGs and their relation to other
galaxy types The ACS nearby galaxy survey ANGST 22 uses data from HST to
derive CMDs and detailed SF histories The survey contains 69 galaxies of which
58 are dIs 17 spirals and the rest dEs The 11 Mpc H and Ultraviolet Galaxy
Survey 11HUGS 89 uses H and GALEX images to look at the SF properties of
SFDGs in the local volume out to 11 Mpc Both these surveys also use Spitzer data
A dedicated Spitzer programme the Spitzer Local Volume Legacy Syrvey LVL
has observed 258 nearby galaxies many of which are supplemented by groundbased
images in broadbands and H The Faint Irregular Galaxies 65 dIs GMRT Survey
FIGGS 4 is using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope GMRT to perform
volume limited 10Mpc H I observations of SFDGs The H I Nearby Galaxy
Survey THINGS 163 at the VLA includes 34 galaxies of which about a dozen
are SFDGs in the distance interval 3D15 Mpc The resolution is 7 and 5 kms1
A similar study Little Things concerns VLA observations of 41 dIs Finally the
Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA ALFALFA blind extragalactic H I survey 39 will
survey galaxies at high latitudes out to a radial velocity of 18000 km s1 It will
improve dramatically on the predecessor HI Parkes All-Sky Survey HIPASS 3
As part of the results the survey will provide us with data of hundreds of dwarf
galaxies with H I masses 1075Mcid12
3 Basic structure and morphology
There is a rich variation in morphologies of SFDGs The local group galaxy
NGC6822 is in many respects a prototype of the normal dIs It is the nearest SFDG
without a massive neighbor In the central area it contains a rich number of H II
regions and star clusters of various ages On larger scales the stars are embedded
in an 18 108Mcid12 H I disk 24 Young stars trace the H I structure out to large dis-
tances 72 Apparently also NGC6822 has been inuenced by tidal interaction that
has caused tidal tails and enhanced star formation in the outer regions Older stars
are more spherically distributed This demonstrates that also dIs may have had an
initial intense star formation epoch during which the galaxy was taken shape but
still in the collapse state The mean SFR over the past 100 Myr is estimated to

14102Mcid12yr1 29 Correcting for He H2 41 and heavy elements we arrive at
a gas consumption timescale of about 19 Gyr rather typical for its type 55
While the luminosity proles of dIs follow a simple exponential law the more
enhanced SF activity in the centres of BCGs possibly linked to dynamical instabil-
ities show a more complex behavior 14 77 111 BCGs often have morphologies
reminiscent of mergers and sometimes experience strong starbursts In an effort to
develop a classication system for BCGs Loose and Thuan 96 proposed four dif-
ferent types with the most common one having several star forming regions near the
centre embedded in a regular halo Kunth et al 77 associated the structure with
that of dEs Papaderos et al 124 found that the luminosity distribution in BCGs
in the optical region could be represented by 1 an exponential component at large
radii describing an underlying older stellar population 2 a plateau at intermedi-
ate radii and 3 a gaussian component at small radii Infrared observations reveal
in many cases a attening of the exponential prole 113 towards the centre The
faint component emerges at very low surface brightness and supports a high age
The presence of a faint extended red component indicates that the host has simi-
larities to dEs In some cases as in the extremely metal poor SFDG SBS 0335052
we observe faint extended emission that is strongly inuenced by nebular emission
After correction the remaining stellar component agrees with a fairly young popu-
lation 62 123 as if the galaxy formed recently
4 Gas content
A substantial part of the SFDGs have high gas mass fractions H I masses range
from a few 106Mcid12 at MB  -10 represented in the FIGGS sample up to a few
times 109Mcid12 at MB -20 The relative H I mass fraction varies from about 5
of the dynamical mass at the high mass end to almost 100 at the low mass end
4 142 The H I disk thickness increases with decreasing luminosity reaching a
mean axis ratio of  q 06 in the faintest dI galaxies 136
In Fig 1 we show the relation between MHI and MB based on 199 galaxies
loosely classied as Irregular 315 LSB galaxies and 224 galaxies classied as
BCGs or H II galaxies The sample has been collected from various publications
4 13 37 50 63 95 129 137 161 Bergvall et al unpublished The classica-
tion is therefore not homogeneous and the sample is not in any sense complete But
it displays interesting relations There is a fairly tight linear relation between H I
mass and luminosity for the different types The MHILB varies with more than one
magnitude over the luminosity range The spread in luminosity is not signicantly
different for the different samples We also see that the distribution of dIs nicely
attaches to the faint end of the BCG distribution It seems that BCGs are merely
scaled up versions of dIs It raises the question about the bursty character of the
BCGs How many galaxies classied as BCGs really differ signicantly from nor-
mal SFDGs in terms of SFRs and gas consumption rates One could have expected
that the BCGs if they are bursting would have an increased dispersion in luminos-

ity since we would catch the galaxy in different stages of a transient event But this
is not the case Is it telling s that the BCGs are not bursting but form stars at a sightly
higher rate than LSBGs over a long period of time
There is an ongoing discussion about the relationships between the morphologi-
cal types of SFDGs and one important question is how LSBGs and BCGs are related
eg 146 Both have low metallicities and high gas mass fractions and reside in sim-
ilar environments 128 134 If BCGs are bursting clearly their progenitors must
be either irregulars or LSBGs As the galaxy enters the burst the luminosity would
increase while the H I mass slowly would decrease The galaxy would move to the
right in Fig 1 As we see the relation for the BCGs is shifted relative to the LSBGs
with about one magnitude Thus it seems obvious that if LSBGs are the progenitors
and the B luminosity roughly can be used as a measure of the SFR they would in-
crease the SFR with a factor of  2 in the transition This agrees with results from
previous investigations eg 125 However with such a small change Occams ra-
zor urges us to primarily consider the case where BCGs always had a higher SFR
than the LSBGs Thus there is no strong support of starbursts in BCGs from these
data More surprise is found from the positions of three well known BCGs in the
diagram NGC 6456 see below I Zw 18 II Zw 70 67 and ESO 338-04 Tol
1924-416 see below The galaxies all cluster along the mean line This is unex-
pected since they are regarded as strong starbursts and therefore should be separated
from the distribution of normal BCGs We would expect strong starburst BCGs to
deviate from their candidate progenitors with 2-3 magnitudes But the shift is only
 1 mag Extinction effects play a minor role since EB-V005 in all 4 galaxies

Another clue to the relation between LSBGs and BCGs can be obtained from a
study of the spatial distribution of H I The scalelength versus MHI from small sizes
up to a few 10 kpc follows that of a constant surface density But the scalelength also
correlates with surface brightness In a comparison between BCGs LSBGs and dI
galaxies van Zee et al 162 nd that the scalelength of BCGs is systematically
smaller than for LSBGs and dIs and roughly corresponds to the optical radius The
central surface density is about a factor of 5 higher Thus if LSBGs are progenitors
of BCGs they rst must reduce the angular momentum of the gas during the tran-
sition phase in order to increase the H I surface density and thereby the SFR In a
similar discussion Staveley-Smith et al 150 concluded that LSBGs and BCGs as
classes probably were unrelated
An important issue concerns the H2 content Stars form out of molecular clouds
and it is known that the relative H2 mass can be substantial in SFGDs H2 lacks
a dipole moment making direct observations of H2 extremely difcult Instead in-
direct observations of the associated CO molecule is used The H2 mass is then
calculated using the CO-to-H2 conversion factor CO The value of COis however
very poorly constrained at low metallicities since the CO line becomes weaker and
also because the radiation eld especially from starburst regions tend to dissociate
the molecule The conditions under which this happens cannot be modelled to high
accuracy and consequently much of our knowledge about the conversion factor is
empirical The problem becomes evident from observations of galaxies in the local
group Leroy et al 94 nd that while M31 M33 LMC and the Milky Way have
quite similar values CO can increase with a factor of 5-10 in SMC and NGC6822
This has serious implications for models of chemical evolution see below and
timescales of gas consumption a central issue as we discuss starburst dwarfs The
transition from normal to high values of CO seems to take place at a metallicity of
12  logOH  82-84 Alternative means of estimating the H2 mass have been
exploited Much H2 is residing in photodissociation regions PDRs In fact PDRs
may be the dominating phase in starburst nuclei 149 PDRs contain ions of low
ionisation potential like C giving rise to the strong emission line C II 158
The emission is strongly correlated with H2 17 and can be used to estimate the
H2 mass As an example we can have a look at IC 10 where Madden et al 99
speculate that as a consequence of the strong UV eld and low metallicity small
CO cores are formed surrounded by extensive C II emitting regions containing
H2 H2 masses based on the CO ux would therefore be severely underestimated
A similar situation may be at hand in the luminous MB -21 BCG Haro 11 6
No doubt the Herschel observatory will provide us with data to further unveil the
interplay between star formation and the ISM
Although with some scatter there is a clear one-to-one relation between SFR and
molecular mass 73 93 In more massive systems one may explain this relation as
a coupling between the coolant CO associated with H2 and conditions for collapse
of giant molecular clouds GMC In low mass systems though a more likely ex-
planation seems to be that the transition from predominantly atomic hydrogen to
molecular occurs under the same conditions as a dramatic drop in gas temperature
that destabilizes clouds and initiates collapse 73 While the mean ratio between
Star forming dwarf galaxies
H2 and H I masses increases with metallicity the scatter is large at low metallicities
and there are cases when the H2 mass is more than 10 times higher than the H I
mass like NGC4630 93 Another case is perhaps Haro 11 discussed above Per-
haps there is a yet unknown mechanism that stimulates an overproduction of gas in
molecular state leading to a starburst event
5 Chemical abundances
SFDGs are characterized by low chemical abundances For a review of metal poor
SFDGs see Kunth and Ostlin 78 In H II regions OH varies from 3 solar
to about half solar using the solar oxygen abundance from Asplund 2 for the
most massive SFDGs 36 As shown by Skillman et al 147 there is a correlation
between luminosity and metallicity among local SFDGs As more data are added
though the scatter increases in particular if the luminosities are based on emission
in the blue part of the spectrum dominated by young stars eg 44 This is partly
due to inhomogeneities in the data but cannot be the full explanation as becomes
evident if we compare the location of LSBGs in the L-Z diagram with that of BCGs
Fig 2a Again the data sample is selected in a subjective way and is limited in
size since we included only galaxies with both H I masses and O abundances We
see a few striking details First of all there is a clear separation between the LSBG
sample and the BCGdI sample They seem to form two parallel sequences shifted
in luminosity by almost 3 magnitudes We see this division also in Fig 2b A least
square t through the whole sample makes no sense it is only confusing since ap-
parently we are dealing with two different categories of galaxies In Fig 2c showing
OH vs MHILB  the two types merge If the B band mainly reects the star for-
mation rate in the galaxies then there is no difference between BCGs and LSBGs
as concerns the star formation efciency per gas mass The major reason for the
difference shown in Fig a and b is probably the scale size and surface density of
the neutral hydrogen gas At the same metallicity the LSBGs are larger brighter
and more extended making the star formation proceed at a slow speed compared to
normal galaxies Perhaps one could say that the difference in distribution between
LSBGs and BCGsdIs reects a division line between dwarfs and normal galax-
ies Only disk galaxies can produce metal rich galaxies the others remain below a
metallicity ceiling of 12logOH83 Tidal dwarfs 28 form an exception to the
rule and are found at O abundances 85 Among the brighter galaxies we nd a
small number of BCGs with higher metallicities mixed with the LSBGs Possibly
we nd progenitors to more luminous MB -16 BCGs among the LSBGs but
hardly among the fainter BCGs since either the LSBG has to get rid of more than
50 of the gas or increase the metallicity with a factor of a few
Before one draws too strong conclusions based on the L-Z or mass-metallicity
diagrams one should consider the inuence of mass exchange between galaxy and
the environment Kunth et al 75 realized the importance of determining the abun-
dances in the neutral H I envelope to better understand the chemical evolution

Kunth and Lebouteiller 74 nd a correlation between metallicities in the neutral
gas and the H II gas indicating that mixing between the newly produced metals and
the H I envelope is taking place There is however a systematic difference in metal-
licity between the two states In the L-Z diagram the most violent starburst dwarfs
are found in the lower rightmost wing of the BCG distribution One of the reasons
may be that the stellar population in these galaxies manages to ionize a large part
of the gas in the central region and consequently the measured metallicity will be
lower than for a milder starburst The most metal poor galaxies the low luminosity
dwarfs IZw18 and SBS0335-052 have metallicities of a few  solarThis is close to
the metallicity derived for the neutral gas in these and other BCGs using UV spec-
troscopy 49 63 63 83 84 156 It appears as if there is a minimum plateau dened
by the mean metallicity of the intergalactic medium ie logOH  -5 156 157
6 Star formation and stellar content
Star formation in SFDGs is strongly self regulated In its simple form it can be quan-
tied as a function of gas temperature and density where the density dependence
roughly can be described as a quadratic Schmidt-type law 80 141 As massive
stars are formed the gas is heated and ionized striving to quench further star forma-
tion But there is also a positive feedback from star formation that seems to stimulate
cloud formation as demonstrated in the correlation between stellar surface density
and the presence of young stars 56 Chemodynamical modelling demonstrate that
Star forming dwarf galaxies
these feedback effects on the order of a few Myr establishes an equilibrium that sta-
bilizes the star formation 71 Because of the density dependence low mass SFDGs
consume their gas very slowly on a time scale larger than a Hubble time 55 57
occasionally eg when galaxies collide and merge bursts of star formation may
occur All these basic properties of SFDGs were discussed amost 40 years ago by
Searle et al 144 Some of the most metal poor galaxies resemble young systems
and for a period of time the possibility that these galaxies could be genuinely young
was discussed After a while it became evident that almost all young galaxy candi-
dates hosted a regular component with colours similar to an old stellar population
eg 58 It is now generally believed that with few exceptions the minimum age
of the oldest population in the SFDGs is at least 1-2 Gyr Whether this is true or
not for the most widely discussed young galaxy candidate I Zw 18 is still a matter
of debate 64 115 159 whereas a second young candidate SBS 0335-052 is still
lacking any evidence for the presence of old stars
While the fundamental principles of local star formation processes can be fairly
well understood the parameters determining the global star formation processes
partly have to be determined empirically We know that small gas rich SFDGs have
consumed less than 5 of their present gas mass in star formation 142 The
relative amount of stars increases with luminosity We can think of three basic sce-
narios to explain this Either the star formation efciency increases with mass so
that most of the stars in massive galaxies were formed at high redshifts while the
low mass galaxies have had more or less a constant SFR This is the closed-box
scenario In the other two scenarios the box is open We can assume that the star
formation efciencies SFEs have been comparable but low mass galaxies have to
a larger extent renewed their gas supply through a continuous infall of fresh gas In
the third alternative SFEs are similar but we now assume that the massive galaxies
have expelled their gas Finally we have to be open for the possibility both the SFE
and the mass in-and outows are dependent on both the galaxy mass and metallic-
ity We can hope to distinguish between the alternatives through observations of the
chemical abundances and in observations of the environments around the galaxies
The SFR in low mass galaxies have been determined using different methods
the UV ux the 77 PAH ux the FIR dust emission the radio continuum or the
H luminosity 69 138 While most methods give information about the present
SFR radio continuum uxes also give a direct measurement of the SFR during the
latest 108 years 16 The most common method however is to use the H lumi-
nosity after correction for dust extinction This works quite well in most SFDGs
At higher masses and in particular in starbursts 48 a substantial fraction of the
ionizing radiation is absorbed by dust and extinction corrections are not adequate
Therefore the SFR determined from H has to be supplemented by the amount de-
rived from the far infrared In low mass galaxies with low SFRs or in LSB galaxies
where the star forming regions are sparsely distributed we notice a signicant dif-
ference between the SFR determined from H as that derived from the UV ux but
see 86 87 These observations and recent analyses of GALEX data 88 indicate
that stochastic effects due to low SFR per area have more impact on H than on the
Nils Bergvall
UV uxes representing a broader range in stellar mass UV uxes therefore may be
more useful to measure SFR in the low mass - low surface luminosity end
Using H Kennicutt Jr 68 studied star formation in disk galaxies and found
that the SFRs declined dramatically at a H I surface density of 3-4 Mcid12pc2 He de-
rived a value for this critical column density from the Toomre criterion In a later
investigation Kennicutt Jr 69 derived a relation between SFR and gas over a wide
mass range incorporating dwarfs as well as massive starburst galaxies He found
that the SFR follows the relation nowadays called the Kennicutt-Schmidt law ie
SFR   14
g  where g is the gas surface mass density As a rst approximation one
may interpret this relation if the SFR is a product between the surface mass density
and the collapse time of a supermassive molecular cloud But Kennicutt also found
that the SFR correlated with the rotation period of the disk so there must also be
some dynamics involved How valid are these relations for the SFDGs In a study
of star formation in dI galaxies Hunter et al 56 found that gas was a factor of
2 lower than the critical density in disk galaxies In the FIGGS survery the low
mass end of SFDGs is mapped in H I 135 Some of the galaxies investigated as
well as other dIs have surface densities below the critical limit The FIGGS survey
contains galaxies with surface densities constantly below the Kennicutt threshold
The median H I mass of 28 107Mcid12and a median blue magnitude MB -132 These
galaxies do have lower SFR than the Kennicutt-Schmidt law predicts but star for-
mation is not completely halted They should be quite relevant as templates for the
rst generation galaxies in the early universe
Star formation cannot occur without formation of molecular clouds All massive
molecular clouds collapse and form stars This is evident from the nearly linear re-
lation between SFR and mass of molecular clouds 93 Leroy et al calculated the
ratio between molecular gas mass and K luminosity B luminosity FIR luminosity
and dynamical mass Somewhat surprisingly these ratios were not found to vary
signicantly along the Hubble sequence The dwarf galaxies in this respect are just
scaled down versions of larger galaxies The molecular mass is proportional to the
stellar mass The MmolMmolHI ratio however increases with mass Thus the more
massive galaxies are more efcient in forming molecular clouds probably as an ef-
fect of increasing pressure with gas mass The resulting increased density in the gas
governs the formation of molecules The scatter in the SFR-Mmol relation however
increases with decreasing mass and as mentioned above the H2 content of low mass
SFDGs is still an open issue
In previous sections we discussed the star formation activity in different SFDG
types based on the B luminosity A more accurate information be be obtained from
H Hunter and Elmegreen 55 investigated over 100 SFDGs and compared the
SFR between galaxies of types classied as Im BCDs Sm and Sab-Sd galaxies A
prominent difference between BCDs and the other types is the high concentration
of star formation towards the centre in BCGs and that there is a much stronger
gradient in the ratio between the H and V luminosities This indicates that gas
recently migrated from the outer regions to the inner within one gigayear As a
consequence the gas surface densities have increased Consequently applying the
Kennicutt-Schmidt law the star formation rate per gas mass has increased and the
Star forming dwarf galaxies
surface brightness is higher The star formation efciency however does not seem
to be signicantly higher in BCDs compared to the other types
In the 11HUGS survey 300 SFDGs within the 11 Mpc distance are imaged in
H and UV An important result is that most of the stars formed in these galaxies
are formed in a quiescent mode Only about 14 are formed in bursts and only a few
 of the galaxies are now in a bursting mode in their study a burst was dened
as a galaxy having an equivalent width in H  EWH  100 A This result is
in agreement with the star formation properties of galaxies in the SDSS where it is
argued that 20 of the star formation occurs in bursts 12
This modest well regulated SF activity is conrmed also in more detailed studies
of galaxies the backyard universe Recently a study of colour-magnitude diagrams
of 60 local dwarf galaxies from the ANGST project was presented 165 Almost
80 of these are SFDGs The galaxies range in MB from -823 to -1777 and in
distance from 13 to 46 Mpc It was found that on average the typical dwarf galaxy
formed 50 of its stellar mass by z  2 and 60 by z  1 Much of the differences
between the different morphological types including dSph occur during the latest 1
Gyr and is strongly environmentally dependent Stellar feedback seems to have less
importance for the transition between the different types Instead a mechanism of
the type tidal stirring 103105 seems to be more attractive A simple description
of the SF history as eg an exponentially decaying SF appears to be inconsistent
with the observations A more complex SF history is needed
7 Starbursts
The name Blue Compact Galaxy was coined by Fritz Zwicky 169 due to their
blue colours and compact appearance on photographic plates About 10 years later
we got access to observational capacities good enough to make it possible to study
these galaxies in detail It was found that indeed the galaxies had high gas masses
and low metallicities as expected if they were young In 1972-73 Searle Sargent
and Bagnuolo applied a model of the spectral evolution of galaxies on observations
of late type galaxies 143 144 Among these were a few of the bluest Searle et
al addressed the question of youth and concluded that probably the galaxies were
not young but experienced short bursts of star formation Prior to this Larson and
Tinsley 82 came to the conclusion that starbursts were generated by interaction
and mergers According to their study starburst should be a common phenomenon
and a characteristic consequence of close encounters and mergers This generated
a new mode of interpretation of star forming galaxies and in 1980 132 the word
starburst was accepted A few years later starburst galaxies had become one of the
hottest topics in extragalactic astronomy During the 2000s about 800 papers per
year contain the word starburst in the abstract
At the same time as this outstanding burst of interest in starbursts occurred there
was also a growing confusion concerning starbursts What was it How should a
starburst be dened This is a persistent problem 70 Classically it was consid-
Nils Bergvall
ered that the star formation rate in a starburst should be signicantly enhanced
compared to the normal SFR for that specic morphological type Alternatively
the gas consumption time scale should be signicantly smaller than a Hubble time
Gradually there was a need to subdivide the starburst population into global star-
bursts and nuclear starbursts The latter occur almost exclusively in normal non-
dwarf galaxies in a local  kpc sized region in the centre Many workers use
EWH as a measure of a starburst One rather widely used criterion for a starburst
is EWH100 A According to models 168 however a galaxy with constant
SFR will have EWH100 A after a Hubble time Thus the EWH criterion
is not optional A better starburst indicator is probably the birthrate parameter b
69 140 It is dened as the ratio between the present SFR and the mean past SFR
b  SFR
SFR A galaxy with b 3 can be regarded as a mild starburst galaxy while one
with b  10 is of the classical starburst type In the study of star forming galaxies
in the SDSS Brinchmann et al 12 concluded that about 20 of star formation
takes place in galaxies with b2-3 It is a matter of taste if one wants to call this a
starburst but the starburst concept gets very watered-down if all galaxies with b2
are to be regarded as starbursts If we use the strong starburst criterion b 10 only
3 of the star formation takes place in bursts

Star forming dwarf galaxies
We Bergvall et al 2011 in proc of Star forming dwarf galaxies Crete 2008
carried out a similar study as Brinchmann et al but with different models and a sup-
plementary set of data of post-starburst galaxies We modelled the stellar population
simply as a mixture of an old stellar population and a young burst In Fig 3 we
show the luminosity function for different subsamples of SFDGs in SDSS DR7 As
concerns the relative number of galaxies with EWH 100 A our results agree
with the results from the 11HUGS survey ie that these constitute a few percent of
galaxies in the luminosity range -17MB -15 If we apply b  3 as a condition for
starbursts we nd that it is fullled by 1 of the sample We also nd that the
b  3 criterion is almost fullled for galaxies with EWH100 A at the low lu-
minosity end of the distribution As we go towards higher luminosities the EWH
criterion is loosing relevance as a starburst criterion
It is interesting to compare these results with studies of nearby galaxies In the
low mass end the starburst concept more or less looses its meaning Stochastic ef-
fects dominate the star formation history and single star forming events can change
the galaxy luminosity signicantly Since the typical dwarf galaxy formed 40 of
its stellar mass at z2 a birthrate parameter of b3 means that the SFR increases
with a factor of 6 with regard to the mean SFR from z2 33 Gyr Therefore it may
be well motivated to redene the criterion Thus in their study of nearby SFGDs
McQuinn et al 107 109 accordingly consider only the latest 6 Gyr when they
discuss starburst properties bb  b 06Gyr They also prefer to lower the con-
dition further and consider the galaxy to be in a starburst condition if this modied b
is  2 Among their targets NGC 6456 has the record b76 We added this galaxy
to the Fig 1 Surprisingly the galaxy deviates very little from the mean relation for
BCGs Quinn et al derive the star formation history from CMDs The nd that the
duration of the starburst in these 18 galaxies is surprisingly long typically 450-650
Myr This is three times the duration adopted by Lee et al 90 and indicates that
self-quenching of the starburst is a rare phenomenon McQuinn et al continues to
discuss other similar studies of the duration of starbursts and cite several indepen-
dent investigations that arrive at much shorter durations often  10 Myr In Fig 4
we have a look at the durations we derived for the SDSS sample If we apply the
EWH100 A criterion the duration of this period agrees with what McQuinn et
al found If we apply the birthrate criterion the duration we obtain is inbetween the
McQuinn value and the Lee et al value What is also interesting to see in the diagram
is that starbursts consume a minute fraction of the available gas Mass consumption
rates higher than a few  are only found among the very longlived bursts
From an historical point of view is becomes clear that the starburst concept now
has become rather watered-down The problem becomes apparent when we go to
the most extreme starburst dwarfs where we may have b014Gyr 15-20 ie with
a specic SFR about 20 times higher than starbursts classied with the weak crite-
rion SFDGs with b014Gyr 3 are rare constituting  1 of all dwarf galaxies
Although these galaxies are involved in a starburst at the moment it does not neces-
sarily mean that the starburst will inuence the evolution of the galaxy signicantly
Neither the mass consumption during the burst or the effects of the stellar winds may
be important Let us look at two examples ESO 338-04 and Haro 11 ESO 338-04

is interacting with a neighboring galaxy 15 It has a b parameter of 11 117 and
produces myriads of clusterssuper star clusters 118 The formation of massive star
clusters is a common phenomenon in starburst galaxies and is explained as an effect
of high pressure 31 What is surprising is that in Fig 1 the galaxy looks completely
normal Since the b parameter is a comparison between the past star formation and
the present the past star formation may have been very modest Then we can obtain
a high b parameter even if the SFE is normal in relation to the available gas mass
The other example is Haro 11 mentioned above in connection to the H2 discus-
sions It has no neighbors but morphologically and kinematically the galaxy appears
to be involved in a merger 116 117 121 It has a gas consumption timescale of
 100 Myr a birthrate parameter b  15 and is involved in a vigorous global star-
burst producing a large number of super star clusters 1 The cluster formation
efciency is about 10 times higher than in large spiral galaxies The FIR SED of
Haro11 is abnormal 32 This is probably due to a very young stellar population
and suggests that stellar winds should be important A strong superwind 8 43 is
observed from the central region and Chandra observations 43 conrm that this
wind is penetrating the gaseous halo and may open channels to the halo In this
context it is interesting to compare Haro 11 to high redshift galaxies in particular
Lyman break galaxies 43 There have been claims for and against a Lyman contin-
uum leakage in the galaxy 43 Leitet et al submitted and therefore Haro 11 may
also be a proxy for Lyman continuum galaxies in the era of cosmic reionization
Today there is a strong support for the scenario that SFDGs were the main drivers of
the cosmic reionization eg 10 11 40 130 and there are indications 120 that the
dwarf galaxies at high redshifts are both metal poor have a atter IMF and a higher
escape rate than local galaxies But from studies of local metal poor dwarfs that are
leaking we can better understand the physical conditions necessary for leakage
Star forming dwarf galaxies
8 Additional evolutionary aspects
Strong starbursts typically have low ages Therefore we expect to be able to trace the
history of this dramatic event What triggered the burst Hunter and Elmegreen 55
found no support for tidally triggered starbursts in their sample of BCGs Several
strong starburst dwarfs live in isolation but show signs of multiple nuclei unordered
velocity elds morphological large-scale distortions etc which supports mergers as
the most common triggering mechanism eg 117 Understanding the triggering
mechanism in low mass starbursts is more of a challenge since the turbulent ve-
locities caused by stellar winds are comparable to the gravitational effects and the
possible merging components have no prominent central concentrations
A burning question is how the different types of dwarf galaxies are related and
the possible transition from one type to another This is an ongoing discussion since
the 1970s 23 27 53 65 97 124 125 144 155 162 It is clear of course that gas
rich galaxies in isolation turn into gas poor But the reverse should not be excluded
There are various possibilities of how this could be achieved except for pure gas
consumption in star formation In starbursts gas may be expelled as consequence
of winds from massive stars and supernovae Ram pressure stripping as the galaxy
falls in towards a cluster with a higher density of the intergalactic medium is another
option Harassment and tidal stirring have also been proposed as important mecha-
nisms The rst step in these studies is to make a comparative investigation of the
stellar populations and their distributions in gas-rich vs gas-poor galaxies
Papaderos et al 125 compare the structural properties of different dwarf galaxy
types The BCDs typically has a central surface brightness 15 mag brighter and a
scale length a factor of 2 smaller than dEs and dIs They conclude that there may
be evolutionary connections between BCDs dEs provided the BCD modies its
structural properties during the transition by a change in the potential eld as a result
of eg a global in- or outows of gas 81 Outows of gas in galactic superwinds
47 is found in many starburst galaxies eg 49 60 61 76 91 100 110 122 153
167 and the energetics cope with those needed to expel the gas In some SFDGs
it has been argued that outows have been efcient mechanisms to remove the gas
eg 30 43 This has been supported by some models of SN driven gas outows
26 30 49 98 From a cosmological point of view dwarf galaxies are remarkably
devoid of baryons 106 and it has been argued that outows could explain this
condition 145 Eg Garnett 36 Pilyugin et al 127 Tremonti et al 160 and
Dalcanton 21 all nd that the effective yields are lower than expected in a closed-
box scenario supporting an ejection of metals Dalcanton argues however that the
amount of mass lost need not be more than 15 In the dwarf starburst Mrk 33
Summers et al 153 nd support for ejection of most of the produced metals and
a small amount 1 of the ISM These ndings are in conict with other results
79 85 which nd support for the closed-box model A potential problem when
investigating the validity of the closed box model is to derive reliable gas masses
at low metallicities in particular molecular hydrogen The galaxies producing the
most metals are also supposed to have the largest amounts of molecular hydrogen
and therefore the total gas mass and effective yield may be underestimated
Nils Bergvall
While the question about selective metal outows is still unsettled there is little
support of SN blowouts of large fractions of the ISM both from observations and
recent modelling 131 No large sinks of gas either neutral molecular or ionized
are found in the intergalactic medium in groups eg 19 52 and when outows
are observed it appears difcult to transfer the gas to the IGM environment eg
151 152 Rather to explain the remarkably low baryon content in dwarf galaxies
X-ray observations 20 seem to favour a baryon loss due to preheating A second
possibility is that large quantities of baryons never was involved in galaxy forma-
tion but reside as warm-hot gas in the large scale cosmic walls 33 The scatter in
the fractional gasstar content however is increasing with decreasing mass so at the
lowest masses SN winds or other mechanisms may play a fundamental role
So what are then the dominating mechanisms that can explain a relationship
between more massive dwarf galaxies What will happen to a BCG after a bursting
phase Meurer et al 112 nd that the DM halos in two BCGs is  10 times higher
than in dIs A high central mass density is found also in Haro 11 18 which makes it
unlikely that BCGs can transform into dIs It seems more probable that BCGs could
develop into dEs eg 38 101 119 125 An attractive mechanism to reduce the gas
content seems to be the scenario of tidal stirring tested by 103 on the local group
galaxies But while it appears attractive in an group environment it will not work
on isolated BCGs so the problem remains
9 Final remarks
With the advent of new instrumentation we expect a strong progress in the research
of star forming dwarf galaxies We already mentioned the recentongoing surveys
with HST Spitzer GALEX and radio observatories The Herschel observatory will
provide information about heating and cooling processes of gas and dust in low
metallicity environments This will also help us to better understand the important
question of H2 in metal poor SFDGs LOFAR will eventually detect low-frequency
radiation from halos of starburst dwarfs Using wide eld 2-D spectroscopy we will
study the nature and triggering mechanisms of starbursts The conditions for Ly
emission and the coupling to Lyman continuum leakage will be explored and ap-
plied on starburst dwarfs at high redshifts 46 Gradually we will understand the
importance of SFDGs in the cosmic reionization and formation of massive galax-
ies the regulating mechanisms of starbursts the violent star formation processes
the mass exchange with the environment and the relation between different types of
dwarf galaxies
