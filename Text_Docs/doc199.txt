THE DEPENDENCE OF GALAXY COLORS ON LUMINOSITY AND ENVIRONMENT AT Z  041
HKC Yee2 BC Hsieh34 H Lin5 MD Gladders6
ABSTRACT
We analyse the B  Rc colors of galaxies as functions of luminosity and local galaxy density using a
large photometric redshift catalog based on the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey We select two samples of
galaxies with a magnitude limit of MRc  185 and redshift ranges of 02  z  04 and 04  z  06
containing  105 galaxies each We model the color distributions of subsamples of galaxies and derive
the red galaxy fraction and peak colors of red and blue galaxies as functions of galaxy luminosity
and environment The evolution of these relationships over the redshift range of z05 to z005 is
analysed in combination with published results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey We nd that there
is a strong evolution in the restframe peak color of bright blue galaxies in that they become redder
with decreasing redshift while the colors of faint blue galaxies remain approximately constant This
eect supports the downsizing scenario of star formation in galaxies While the general dependence
of the galaxy color distributions on the environment is small we nd that the change of red galaxy
fraction with epoch is a function of the local galaxy density suggesting that the downsizing eect may
operate with dierent timescales in regions of dierent galaxy densities

1 INTRODUCTION
Many investigations in the past 30 years have shown
that galaxy populations manifested by galaxy colors
spectra and morphological distributions have a strong
dependence on the environment and luminosity of the
galaxies eg Melnick  Sargent 1970 Dressler 1980 de
Vaucouleurs 1961 and many other subsequent studies
More recently much more detailed analyzes of galaxy
color distributions in the local universe have become
available using large galaxy samples of tens of thousands
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS Baldry et al
2004 and others show that the colors of galaxies can be
neatly separated into components of red and blue galax-
ies Balogh et al
2004 hereafter B04 were able to
delineate the dependence of galaxy colors on galaxy lu-
minosity and environment concluding that there is only
a weak dependence on the latter
In this Letter we present a similar study of galaxy sam-
ples at redshift between 02 and 06 using the photometric
redshift galaxy catalogs from the Red-Sequence Cluster
Survey RCS from Hsieh et al 2005 hereafter H05
Combined with results from a z005 sample from the
SDSS B04 we examine the trend of the dependence
of galaxy colors on luminosity and environment at dif-
ferent epochs In 2 we briey describe the photometric

2 THE PHOTOMETRIC REDSHIFT GALAXY DATA
The RCS is a 92 square degree imaging survey in the z 
and Rc bands conducted with the CFHT 36m and the
CTIO 4m to search for galaxy clusters in the redshift
range of z  14 see Gladders  Yee 2005 Additional
imaging in the V and B bands was also obtained for
336 square degrees in the northern patches using the
CFH12K camera The observation and data reduction
techniques are discussed in detail in Gladders  Yee
2005 for the z  and Rc data and in H05 for the V
and B data Photometric redshifts for 12 million galax-
ies using the four-color photometry are derived using an
empirical training set method with 4924 spectroscopic
redshifts Detailed descriptions of the photometric red-
shift method and the precision and completeness of the
sample are presented in H05
We select samples of galaxies covering two moderate
redshift intervals using conservative criteria to minimize
redshift and color errors We choose galaxies with abso-
lute magnitudes MRc  185 in the photometric red-
shift bins 02  z  04 hereafter the z03 sample
and 04  z  06 hereafter the z05 sample with
redshift uncertainty z1  z  01 where z is the
computed photometric redshift uncertainty see H05
The absolute magnitudes are corrected for K-correction
and estimated evolution For each galaxy we use model
colors computed from the spectral energy distributions
of galaxies from Coleman et al 1980 to estimate a
galaxy spectral type based on the observed Rc  z  color
and derive K-corrections for the B and Rc magnitudes
We approximate the Rc band luminosity evolution by
M z  M 0  Qz see Lin et al 1999 where we
adopted Q  15 for early-type galaxies B  R  18

ple of 106095 and 124004 galaxies for the z03 and
z05 sample respectively
We estimate the local galaxy density using a projected
surface density as a proxy see eg Dressler 1980 For
each galaxy in the primary sample we measure R5 the
distance to the fth nearest neighbor with MRc  195
from which a local surface density parameter 5 in units
of Mpc2 proportional to R2
5  is computed For count-
ing the ve objects we select only those with photometric
redshifts within 2z of the primary galaxy A complete-
ness correction for each neighbor is applied as not all
galaxies within the sampling magnitude range satisfy the
redshift uncertainty criterion The completeness factor
is estimated using the ratio of the total number of galax-
ies within a 01 mag bin at the magnitude of the neigh-
criterion Since red galaxies on average have lower photo-
metric redshift uncertainties we rene our completeness
correction by computing the factor separately for red and
blue galaxies separated at B  Rc  18 The average
completeness correction factor is 110 We count the
nearest neighbors to the primary galaxy by summing the
corrected weight for each galaxy until the total is  50
To be able to put the 5 parameter for galaxies at
dierent redshift on a comparative scale a background
correction must be applied to 5 This is estimated for
each primary galaxy by computing the average number of
galaxies in a circle of radius R5 using galaxies in the same
RCS patch of size  25 deg 2 see Gladders  Yee 2005
that satisfy the redshift and magnitude criteria used for
the counting of the neighbors Completeness corrections
are also applied in the counting of the background galax-

galaxy distributions as a function of local galaxy density for sam-

3 RESULTS
The two panels of Figure 1 show the rest B  Rc0 dis-
tributions in bins of absolute magnitude and 5 for the
z03 and z05 bins We divide the galaxies into sub-
samples of local density such that the rst bin contains
the least dense 125 of the galaxies the next three
bins each of the successive 25 and the last bin the
most dense 125 The solid lines are the two-Gaussian
ts for the red and blue populations Qualitatively the
two-Gaussian model that has been used for the SDSS
z  005 galaxy samples by Baldry et al 2004 and B04
is also a reasonable descriptor of the data at these higher
and our data are r  Rc05 and ur  2B Rc04
based on galaxy color data from Fukugita et al 1995
We also repeat the calculation using a sample with a
more liberal error criterion z1  z  04 this pro-
duces qualitatively identical results showing that the in-
completeness correction works well
Figure 2 shows the fraction of red galaxies fr de-
rived from integrating the Gaussian ts as a function
of local density for each magnitude bin for the two red-
shift samples The uncertainty for each fr value is esti-
mated by generating 100 Monte-Carlo realizations based
on the errors on the parameters of the corresponding
two-Gaussian t We take the 68 condence limits on
fr for the 100 results to be the 1 uncertainty For
both redshift bins there is a strong dependence of fr on
luminosity covering a factor of 56 with the luminous
galaxy samples having the higher values Within each
magnitude bin the dependence of fr on local density
however is relatively moderate especially for the fainter
galaxies
Figure 3 illustrates the dependence of the peak
B  Rc0 of the Gaussian ts on local density for galax-
ies of dierent luminosities Similar to the SDSS result
at z005 B04 Hogg et al 2003 the peak colors of the
color distributions of both the red and the blue galaxies
have only a weak dependence on the local galaxy den-
sity We note that because of the scatter of the back-
ground corrections there will be some blurring of the
local density parameter however this smoothing should
have minimal eect at the high density bins where the
density is much higher than the scatter in the background
correction
4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Using the three redshift epochs we nd a number of
interesting evolutionary eects in the color distribution
of galaxies We nd the peak colors of the red galaxy
distributions to be remarkably similar over the three
redshift bins The color peaks for both the z03 and
z05 samples for the dierent magnitude subsamples
range from B  Rc0 of  13 to  16 with the brighter
red galaxies being redder This is essentially identical to
the z005 SDSS samples of B04 over a similar luminos-
ity range which have ur  22 to 25 or BRc  13 to
15 Hence there has been only minimal changes in the
colors of red galaxies in all environments from z05 to
z005 The small color changes suggest that red galax-
ies of all luminosities and in dierent environments are
already well-evolved by redshift  06 eg see models
in Bruzual  Charlot 1993
The dierence in B  Rc0 for red galaxies of dierent
absolute magnitudes is likely due to the slope of the color-
magnitude relation CMR for early-type galaxies The
range of B  Rc0 of  03 mag over  45 mag in MRc
is equivalent to a CMR slope of 006 very similar to
the slope of 003 to 008 found in the CMR of galaxy
clusters eg Lopez-Cruz et al 2004
The blue galaxy color distributions however show a
strong evolutionary eect from z05 to z0 For the
z05 sample the peak colors of the blue galaxies are
essentially independent of the luminosity of the galax-
ies with values bunching up around B  R   085
The Dependence of Galaxy Colors
blue as the faintest blue galaxies at lower redshift For
the z03 sample the blue galaxies in the two brighter
bins MRc  205 now have color peaks 02 to 04 mag
redder than that of the faintest blue galaxy bin Com-
paring to the z005 sample of B04 their Figure 3 the
evolution is quite dramatic Here the peak color of each
successive brighter bin shifts signicantly to the red to
the point where the brightest blue galaxy bin has almost
the same color peak as the faintest red galaxy bin We
also note that the bluest peaks in our data are about 01
mag bluer than the corresponding bin in B04
This evolution of the blue galaxy peak colors can be
interpreted in the context of a down-sizing scenario a
term rst suggested by Cowie et al 1996 To rst or-
der we can assume that B  Rc0 provides a measure
of the specic star formation rate SSFR dened as the
star formation rate per unit mass or the time since the
last major star formation episode eg Bruzual  Char-
lot 1993 At z05 blue galaxies of all luminosities have
very similar B  Rc0 color peaks which is consistent
with galaxies of dierent masses having similar SSFRs
The mean colors of the brighter blue galaxies then be-
come progressively redder with time while those of the
faint galaxies remain blue This can be interpreted as
the decrease in the SSFR being a strong function of the
luminosity of the galaxy the more massive the galaxy
the larger the decrease or alternatively the earlier in
time the decrease takes place
This interpretation is in excellent agreement with
the results of Heavens et al 2004 who analysed the
z005 SDSS spectra to recover the star formation his-
tory Their Figure 2 shows that low-mass galaxies have
a more or less constant star formation rate from z  1
peaking at z  04 to 02 In comparison the more mas-
sive galaxies have their star formation peak much earlier
and show a decline as early as z  1 and by z005 the
SSFRs for galaxies of dierent masses are dierent by
a factor of more than 10 We note the complementary
nature of the techniques used to arrive at a similar con-
clusion in that the Heavens et al work is based on the re-
construction of star formation histories from present-day
stellar populations whereas our results are derived from
direct measurements of galaxy colors at earlier epochs
We nd clear indications of evolution in fr from
z05 to z005 in that there is a general increase in
fr at lower redshift Comparing our high redshift bins
with the SDSS results B04 the evolution of fr also ap-
pears to be a function of the local galaxy density the
z05 sample has a much atter dependence of fr on
local density In B04s Figure 2 there is a strong local
density dependence of fr for galaxies of all luminosities
fr ranges from 01 to 04 for galaxies of dierent lumi-
nosities in the lowest density sample and from 065 to
085 for the highest density samples By comparison fr
in our two higher redshift bins has a similar range 01
to 04 for the low density environment but has values
between 015 and 06 in the densest regions Thus there
is a lack of faint red galaxies in the high density bins
fr  04 for all but the most luminous galaxies In other
02 there are many moderately luminous to
words at z 
faint blue galaxies in high density regions This drop of
fr at high density and high redshift could be a reec-
tion of the change in the morphology-density relation at
z  05 eg Dressler et al 1997 Smith et al 2005
The lack of faint red galaxies in high density regions has
also been noted by others at moderate to high redshifts
eg Kodama et al 2004
The density-dependent evolution of fr suggests the
need for an additional element in the downsizing sce-
nario the downsizing timescale is a function of the en-
vironment That is for galaxies of similar masses the
drop in star formation rate occurs successively later for
galaxies in less dense environments The increase of the
faint blue galaxy fraction in the high redshift high den-
sity samples can be interpreted as these galaxies having
their peak star formation era at a redshift of  03 to
02 Heavens et al 2004 followed by a decline resulting
in a high faint red galaxy fraction at z005 Figure 2
B04 In the less dense regions the star formation rate
continues to be high to lower redshifts see eg Gomez
et al 2003 keeping the blue galaxy fraction high This
is supported qualitatively by the positive if small gra-
dients in the B  Rc0 peak going from the least to the
most dense samples for all redshift bins
In summary we have analysed the B  Rc0 color dis-
tribution of a sample of  230 000 galaxies with photo-
metric redshifts between 02 and 06 and MRc  185
in combination with the results derived at z005 by B04
using SDSS data We nd there is a strong evolution in
the peak B  Rc0 colors of the blue galaxies consistent
with a downsizing star formation scenario where more
massive galaxies have their peak star formation time oc-
curring at earlier epochs This is in excellent qualitative
agreement with star formation histories of galaxies of dif-
ferent masses derived by Heavens et al 2004 using the
technique of fossil stellar populations We also nd
that the evolution of the red galaxy fraction is depen-
dent on local galaxy density in that there is a signicant
decit of faint red galaxies in rich environments at high
redshift In a future paper we will examine the evolu-
tion of the color distributions for galaxies in dierent
local densities in various global environments eg clus-
ter core cluster outskirt and eld and interpret the
results more quantitatively in terms of stellar mass and
star formation rate via stellar population models
