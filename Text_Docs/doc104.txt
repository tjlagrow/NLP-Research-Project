Abstract
We present cosmological hydrodynamic simulations performed to study evolution of galaxy popula-
tion The simulations follow timed release of mass energy and metals by stellar evolution and employ
phenomenological treatments of supernova feedback pre-supernova feedback modeled as feedback by radi-
ation pressure from massive stars and quenching of gas cooling in large halos We construct the ducial
model so that it reproduces the observationally estimated galaxy stellar mass functions and the relation-
ships between the galaxy stellar mass and the host halo mass from z  4 to 0 We nd that the ducial
model constructed this way naturally explains the cosmic star formation history the galaxy downsizing
and the star formation rate and metallicity of the star-forming galaxies The simulations without the
quenching of the gas cooling in large halos overproduce massive galaxies at z  2 and fail to reproduce
galaxy downsizing The simulations that do not employ the radiation pressure feedback from young stars
predict too strong redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity relation Furthermore the slope of the relation
becomes too steep at low redshift without the radiation pressure feedback The metallicity dependence
in the radiation pressure feedback is a key to explain the observed mass-metallicity relation These facts
indicate that these two processes in addition to supernova feedback are essential for galaxy evolution Our
simple phenomenological model is suitable to construct a mock galaxy sample to study physical properties
of observed galaxy populations

Introduction
Understanding galaxy formation is a challenging prob-
lem whose solution will require a concerted approach com-
bining observational and theoretical work There have
been substantial advances on both fronts in the past
decades Numerical simulations are a powerful theoretical
tool to study cosmic structure formation N -body simula-
tions are now able to predict non-linear growth of the dark
matter-dominated density perturbations in great detail
Springel et al 2005 Springel et al 2008 Diemand et al
2008 Boylan-Kolchin et al 2009 Consequently gravita-
tional assembly of structure in a -dominated Cold Dark
Matter CDM Universe is well understood and mostly
consistent with observations In order to make a direct
comparison with observations simulations must involve
luminous matters baryons besides dark matter and dark
energy While semi-analytic models eg White  Frenk
1991 Kaumann et al 1993 Somerville  Primack 1999
Cole et al 2000 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 Nagashima
et al 2005 can paint galaxies onto dark matter distri-
bution hydrodynamic simulations can directly explore
evolution of the galaxy population and the intergalactic
medium IGM simultaneously and self-consistently eg
Katz et al 1992 Weinberg et al 1997 Keres et al 2005
Oppenheimer  Dave 2006 Ocvirk et al 2008 Crain et al
2009 Schaye et al 2010 Vogelsberger et al 2013 The
baryonic processes that are essential for galaxy formation
such as gas cooling star formation and stellar and active
galactic nuclei AGN feedback constitute a complicated
and highly non-linear network Modeling them appro-
priately in hydrodynamic simulations is hence the major
challenge for the theoretical studies of galaxy formation

tic galaxies Okamoto et al 2010 Governato et al

star formation While it is possible to drive winds by re-
solving the detailed structure of the interstellar medium
ISM in very high resolution simulations Hopkins et al
2012a most of cosmological simulations invoke phe-
nomenological treatments of feedback because of limited
numerical resolution Some studies employ explicit winds
either hydrodynamically decoupled Springel  Hernquist
2003 or coupled Dalla Vecchia  Schaye 2008 The
wind properties may depend on the galaxy properties
Oppenheimer  Dave 2006 Okamoto et al 2010 Other
popular way of implementing eective feedback is inject-
ing thermal energy into the ISM and then shutting o
cooling of heated gas for a while Thacker  Couchman
2001 Stinson et al 2006 Stinson et al 2013 Adding the
feedback energy as non-thermal energy eg turbulence
which decays in time-scale much longer than the cooling
time has a similar eect Teyssier et al 2013
We have applied the feedback model developed by
Okamoto et al 2008b to large scale simulations to study
high redshift galaxy populations such as Lyman- emit-
ters Shimizu et al 2011 sub-mm galaxies Shimizu et al
2012 and Lyman break galaxies at z  7 Shimizu et al
2013 Inoue et al 2014 While these simulations repro-
duce many observed properties of high redshift galaxies
our studies utilizing the large scale simulations have been
limited to high redshift because too massive galaxies form
at low redshift see Shimizu et al 2012 We also note that
too many stars form in low mass halos at high redshift if
we normalize the model to reproduce the luminosity or
stellar mass function of the local faint galaxies Moster
et al 2013 Okamoto 2013
The rst problem is well-known stellar feedback alone
cannot prevent monster galaxies from forming and hence
we need a physical process that operates preferentially in
large halos to quench gas cooling there eg Benson et al
2003 The top candidate of such a process is so-called
AGN radio mode feedback Croton et al 2006 Bower et al
2006 Sijacki et al 2007 and Okamoto et al 2008b
suggest that this radio mode feedback is naturally realized
by considering the change of the accretion modes onto a
supermassive blackhole In fact simulations including this
feedback roughly reproduce galaxy stellar mass functions
and stellar mass to halo mass relations for massive galaxies
Vogelsberger et al 2013 Torrey et al 2013
A remedy for the second problem has been recently
identied by Stinson et al 2013 feedback prior to an
SN such as stellar winds and radiation from massive stars
is needed to match stellar mass-halo mass relations over
a wide redshift range Stinson et al 2013 Kannan et al
2013 Aumer et al 2013
The aim of this paper is to update our galaxy formation
model originally developed by Okamoto et al 2008b and
Okamoto et al 2010 by adding several new feedback
processes so that we can apply it for studies of galaxy
population over wider mass and redshift ranges We test
our models against various observations and reveal roles
of each feedback process to present a ducial model
The paper is organized as follows
In section 2 we
describe our simulations and provide descriptions of our
modeling of baryonic processes We present our results
at 0  z  4 and compare them with the available obser-
vational estimates in section 3 We investigate resolution
eects in section 4 Finally we summarize our results and
discuss future applications of the new model in section 5
2 Simulations
We rst describe our cosmological hydrodynamic sim-
ulations The simulation code is based on an early ver-
sion of Tree-PM smoothed particle hydrodynamics SPH
code GADGET-3 which is a successor of Tree-PM SPH code
GADGET-2 Springel 2005 We have implemented a time-
step limiter Saitoh  Makino 2009 that reduces the
time-step of a gas particle if it is too long compared to
the neighboring gas particles We have also added an ar-
ticial conductivity Rosswog  Price 2007 Price 2008
in order to capture the instabilities at contact surfaces
see also Kawata et al 2013 which cannot be captured
by the standard SPH Okamoto et al 2003 Agertz et al
2007 together with the time dependent articial viscos-
ity Morris  Monaghan 1997
We assume CDM cosmology with the following pa-
rameters 0  0318   0682 b  0049 8 
0835 ns  0962 and a Hubble constant of H0 
100 h km s1 Mpc1 where h  067 These param-
eters are consistent with Planck 2013 results Planck
Collaboration 2013 Throughout this paper we use a
cosmological periodic box of the side length of 40 h1 Mpc
and start simulations from z  127 unless otherwise stated
We employ 2563 dark matter particles and the same num-
ber of SPH particles The total number the particles can
change owing to the star formation The mass of a dark
matter particle is 29  108h1M and that of an SPH
particle is 52  107 h1M The gravitational soften-
ing length is set to 86 h1 kpc in comoving units both
for the dark matter and SPH particles and stars until
z  3 thereafter it is frozen in physical units at the value
22h1 kpc
21 Baryonic processes
The simulations include many physical processes that
are relevant to galaxy formation Both photo-heating by
a spatially uniform time-evolving ultra-violet background
and radiative cooling depend on gas metallicity as de-
scribed in Wiersma et al 2009a The cooling and heat-
ing rates are computed individually for eleven elements
H He C N O Ne Mg Si S Ca and Fe We track
only nine elements and we take S and Ca to be propor-
tional to Si Wiersma et al 2009b As in Okamoto et al
2005 we use the smoothed metallicity instead of the
particle metallicity to compute the photo-heating and ra-
diative cooling rates and to give the initial amount of each
individual chemical element to newly born stars Note
however that we do not include explicit metal diusion
We assume star formation takes place when gas den-
sity exceeds a threshold density for star formation nH

While in our previous studies we have treated a star
forming gas particle as a hybrid particle that contains hot
and cold phases Okamoto et al 2008b Okamoto et al
2010 Shimizu et al 2011 Shimizu et al 2012 Shimizu
et al 2013 we abandon doing this in this paper since
global star formation properties of simulated galaxies are
highly self-regulated by strong feedback and are almost
independent of the treatment of the equation of states of
the star-forming gas Okamoto et al 2010 Schaye et al
The star formation rate SFR density
 for a gas
particle with the density  is then simply given by
  c
where c and tdyn are respectively the dimensionless star
formation eciency parameter and the local dynamical
time This formula corresponds to the Schmidt law that
implies an SFR density proportional to 15 We set c 
001 in order to reproduce the observed relation between
the surface gas density and the surface star formation rate
density Kennicutt 1998 Technically we compute the
probability P for an SPH particle with which it spawns
a new star particle of mass m during a time-step t
where mSPH is the mass of the gas particle and the star
formation time-scale t is dened as t  tdync We use
m  morig
SPH denotes
the original SPH particle mass
SPH2 throughout this paper where morig
Stellar evolution is modeled as in Okamoto et al 2010
We employ the Chabrier initial mass function IMF
Chabrier 2003 and we use metallicity dependent stellar
lifetimes and chemical yields Portinari et al 1998 Marigo
2001 The production of metals by SNe and AGB stars
stellar mass loss and stellar feedback all take place on
the time-scale dictated by stellar evolution considerations
When we compare our results with observational esti-
mates that assume dierent IMFs we convert them to
the Chabrier IMF1
We now discuss the numerical implementation of im-
portant subgrid processes included in our simulations
22 Stellar feedback
In our subgrid model stellar feedback gives rise to
a wind by imparting kinetic energy and momentum to
nearby gas particles The wind is characterized by its ini-
tial speed vw
The direction of the wind is chosen at random to be
either parallel or antiparallel to the vector v  v  agrav
where v is the average velocity of the neighboring 64 dark
matter particles and agrav is the gravitational accelera-
tion Okamoto et al 2010 found that the direction of
1 We convert stellar mass and SFR obtained by assuming the
Salpeter IMF Salpeter 1955 and the Kroupa IMF Kroupa 2001
into those with the Chabrier IMF by dividing them by 18 and
11 respectively
the wind particle velocity dened in this way leads to wind
particles being ejected preferentially along the rotation
axis of a spinning object and thus generating an axial
wind Springel  Hernquist 2003 We assume that the
newly launched wind particles are decoupled from hydro-
dynamic interactions for a brief period of time Springel
 Hernquist 2003 Full hydrodynamic interactions are
enabled once a wind particle leaves the star-forming re-
gion nH  001 cc1 or after the time 10 kpcvw has
elapsed whichever occurs earlier
221 Supernova-driven winds
We assume that some fraction of the energy released
from SNe is potentially available to power the kinetic en-
ergy of the wind Each SN releases energy of 1051 erg and
the fraction of energy used to drive wind is controlled by
an eciency parameter SN As in Parry et al 2012
and Okamoto 2013 we suppose that only Type II SNe
are responsible for driving winds and the energy released
from Type Ia SNe is distributed as thermal energy to sur-
rounding gas particles
During any given time-step a gas particle may receive
supernova energy Q from one or more neighboring star
particles If this happens the particle is given a proba-
bility P SN
w  with which it becomes a wind particle during
that time-step
2 mSPHv2
where vwSN is the initial wind speed The value of vwSN
is dened to be proportional to the one-dimensional ve-
locity dispersion of the neighboring dark matter particles
 namely
vwSN  SN
where SN
w is a proportional constant that denes the
wind speed with respect to the local velocity dispersion
This scaling is motivated by the data on galactic outows
Martin 2005 Okamoto et al 2010 have shown that
doing this reproduces the observed luminosity function
and the luminosity-metallicity relation of the Local Group
satellite galaxies Puchwein  Springel 2013 have re-
ported a good match to the faint end slope of the observed
galaxy stellar mass function with this scaling
222 Pre-supernova feedback
Stinson et al 2013 identied that the lag between a
star formation event and an SN explosion  10 Myr is
likely to be a source of the diculty for simulations in re-
producing the observationally suggested relation between
stellar mass and halo mass They reproduced the relation
by distributing 10  of the bolometric luminosity emit-
ted by young stars to the surrounding star-forming gas
as thermal energy over 08 Myr time period before an SN
goes o
Recently some numerical studies have indicated the im-
portance of radiation pressure feedback from young stars

Momentum injection by stellar winds also cannot be ig-
nored Hopkins et al 2012b Massive stars can radia-
tively drive stellar winds from their envelopes during the
rst stage of evolution reaching terminal velocities of
10003000 km s1 The momentum injection by the
stellar winds is roughly the same order as that by the
radiation pressure Agertz et al 2013 We thus con-
sider the momentum driven winds Oppenheimer  Dave
2006 Oppenheimer  Dave 2008 as the pre-SN feedback
in this paper
The momentum injection rate from radiation can be
written as
prad  1  2IR
where 1 and 2 respectively dene the momentum trans-
fer eciencies for the direct absorptionscattering and for
the multi-scattering by infrared photons re-radiated by
dust particles IR is the infrared optical depth Lt is
the luminosity of the stellar population which we calcu-
late using a population synthesis code P EGASE Fioc 
Rocca-Volmerange 1997 as a function of the age and the
metallicity of the star particle and c is the speed of light
The rst term of equation 5 should be proportional to
1  expUV where UV is the ultraviolet UV optical
depth Since the dust and H i opacities in the UV present
in star-forming regions are very large it is reasonable to
assume that the value of 1 is around unity The esti-
mation of IR is problematic because we cannot resolve
star-forming clouds in large volume simulations We here
simply assume that IR scales linearly with the metallicity
of a star particle2 see Aumer et al 2013 and Agertz et al
2013 for more elaborate estimations of IR Under this
assumption equation 5 reduces to
where vwrad is the initial wind speed of the momentum-
driven wind As for the SN-driven wind we assume that
the wind speed is proportional to the local velocity dis-
persion as
vwrad  rad
Since the role of the pre-SN feedback is to delay the star
formation until the SN feedback takes place Stinson et al
2013 we assume rad
w so that the expelled gas by
the pre-SN feedback can fall back later Okamoto et al
2010 found that the winds with the initial wind speed of
3 are inecient and have little eect on the luminosity
function at z  0 We hence employ rad

The probability with which a gas particle is added
to a wind is given as the sum of the two probability
Pw  P SN

generate a uniform random number between zero and one
When Pw exceeds this number the gas particle is added
to a wind We determine whether the wind is SN- or radi-
ation pressure-driven by drawing a uniform random num-
ber between zero and one again If P SN
greater than this number the gas particle is launched as
an SN-driven wind with vwSN otherwise it becomes a ra-
diation pressure-driven wind with vwrad When the value
of Pw exceeds unity we distribute its excess energy and
momentum to its neighboring gas particles as described

2 We must use the IR optical depth of a cloud in which the stellar
population ie star particle is embedded The metallicity of the
cloud should be comparable to that of the stellar population be-
cause the stellar population inherits the metallicity of the parent
It is now widely accepted that the stellar feedback alone
cannot explain bright- massive- end of the galaxy lu-
minosity mass function and a feedback process that
operates preferentially in large halos is needed
Benson et al 2003 High resolution X-ray observations
of galaxy clusters have revealed large radio-plasma cavi-
ties in intracluster media ICM These are usually associ-
ated with episodic outbursts from a central radio galaxy
and indicate that huge amounts of mechanical energy are
being deposited into the ICM by powerful AGN-driven
jets Brzan et al 2004 Allen et al 2006 Fabian et al
2006 Taylor et al 2006 Simulations investigating the
impact of these AGN-driven radio cavities suggest that
this powerful feedback provides sucient energy to o-
set the cooling radiation from the cluster and potentially
explains why so little cool gas is seen in these systems
Quilis et al 2001 Churazov et al 2002 Dalla Vecchia
et al 2004 Omma et al 2004 Sijacki  Springel 2006
Simple prescriptions for the feedback from AGN jets
aka radio-mode feedback have been incorporated into
semi-analytic galaxy formation models eg Croton et al
2006 Bower et al 2006
Including radio-mode AGN
feedback has resulted in dramatic improvements in the
Evolution of galaxy population
models ability to match the sharp decline of the galaxy
luminosity function and to explain the downsizing seen
in the evolution of the galaxy population Bower et al
2006 showed that by assuming that AGN radio-mode
feedback operates only in quasi-hydrostatic halos where
the cooling time is longer than the dynamical time the
galaxy luminosity functions in local and higher redshift
universe can be matched well
In order to model the AGN radio-mode feedback Sijacki
et al 2007 and Okamoto et al 2008b distinguished two
fundamentally dierent modes of AGN accretion radia-
tively ecient geometrically thin accretion ows stan-
dard disks Shakura  Sunyaev 1973 and geometri-
cally thick radiatively inecient accretion ows which
we will generically refer to as RIAFs Narayan et al
1998 Narayan 2005 They assumed only the latter is
responsible for the radio-mode feedback through produc-
tion of powerful jets eg Rees et al 1982 Meier 2001
Maccarone et al 2003 Churazov et al 2005 Since RIAFs
exist only when the accretion rate is much lower than
the Eddington rate Narayan et al 1998 the radio-mode
feedback is naturally switched on in cooling inecient
large halos where central blackholes become very mas-
sive and gas supply to them is slowed down Sijacki et al
2007 Okamoto et al 2008b
We however take a simpler phenomenological approach
in this paper because modeling AGN feedback inevitably
introduces many uncertainties such as seed blackhole
mass accretion rates onto blackholes blackhole mergers
and feedback from AGN In our phenomenological treat-
ment we simply assume that the radiative cooling is sup-
pressed in large halos where one-dimensional dark matter
velocity dispersion is larger than thz We parameterize
the functional form of thz as
thz  01  z
where the parameter  controls the redshift dependence
In order to reduce cooling in large halos we modify the
cooling function T Z as
T Z   T Z
  th
T Z expcid16 th
th cid17 otherwise
where the parameter  species how steeply the cooling
is suppressed above the threshold velocity dispersion th
We nd that a sudden suppression ie T Z   0 for
  th creates an unwanted bump around the mass cor-
responding to th in the galaxy stellar mass function To
mimic the AGN radio-mode feedback  must be greater
than 0 since the velocity dispersion of a cooling inecient
halo increases with increasing redshift and for given ve-
locity dispersion of a halo the central blackhole mass is
likely to become smaller with increasing redshift3 We
adopt   075 and   03 in our ducial model Croton
et al 2006 Nagashima et al 2005 As we will show later
3 Without the redshift dependence ie   0 it is still possible
to obtain a galaxy stellar mass function compatible with obser-
vational estimates at z  0 We however lack massive galaxies at
higher redshift in this case see Shimizu et al 2012
this choice makes the quenching almost negligible at high
redshift z  2 because th becomes large and halos that
have higher velocity dispersion than th are quite rare
We note that the comparable results to this set of param-
eters can be obtained with 0  100 km s1 if we assume
a sudden suppression of the gas cooling above th
24 Models
We list the values of the model parameters in Table 1
which we choose to match the observational estimates of
the stellar mass functions and the stellar mass fractions
from z  4 to 0 We show several combinations of the
above feedback processes in order to highlight roles of
each process We refer to the SN feedback the radia-
tion pressure feedback and the quenching of the cool-
ing in large halos as SN RP and AGN respectively
for short
SN
SNRP SNAGN and SNRPAGN The model
that employs all the feedback processes SNRPAGN
is our ducial model The model that only considers the
SN feedback SN corresponds to the model we used in
our previous studies Shimizu et al 2011 Shimizu et al
2012 Shimizu et al 2013 although the values of the pa-
rameters in these studies are slightly dierent from those
in this paper mainly due to the dierences in the numeri-
cal resolution and cosmology
In this paper we show the models
3 Results
In this section we compare our simulations with the
available observational estimates from z  4 to 0 and show
eects of each feedback process To identify virialized
dark matter halos we rst run the friends-of-friends FoF
group nder Davis et al 1985 with a linking length 02
in units of the mean dark matter particle separation Gas
and star particles near dark matter particles which com-
pose a FoF group are also regarded as the member of the
group We then identify gravitationally bound groups of
dark matter gas and stars in each FoF group by using
the SUBFIND algorithm Springel et al 2001 We regard a
gravitationally bound group of particles that consists of at
least 32 particles and contains at least 10 star particles as
a galaxy We do not discriminate between satellite and
central galaxies in our analyses unless otherwise stated
In order to exclude diusely distributed stellar compo-
nent Zibetti et al 2005 McGee  Balogh 2010 from the
stellar component of a galaxy we dene the galactic stel-
lar mass as the sum of stellar mass within twice the stellar
half mass radius as done in Vogelsberger et al 2013
31 Stellar mass
Since we have chosen the model parameters so that to
reproduce the observationally estimated stellar mass func-
tions and stellar mass fractions as functions of the halo
mass we rst show how the simulations compare to these
estimates In gure 1 we show the simulated galaxy stel-
lar mass functions at z  4 3 2 1 05 and 0 We also
plot the observational estimates at each redshift
We note that all the models agree with the observa-

previous studies of the high redshift galaxy populations
Shimizu et al 2011 Shimizu et al 2012 Shimizu et al
2013 where we only considered the SN-driven winds At
z  2 however the models without AGN form far too
many massive galaxies conrming that some quenching
mechanism of the gas cooing in large halos is needed Both
SNAGN and SNRPAGN reproduce the observed
galaxy stellar mass functions at all six redshifts reason-
ably well For easier comparison with the observational
estimates we show the ducial model SNRPAGN in
the right panels of gure 1
The role of the radiation pressure-driven winds RP
are not evident from this analysis We shall investigate
it in more detail by looking at the galaxy formation e-
ciency as function of the halo mass

2013 Using this technique a detailed link between ob-
served galaxy stellar mass and their host halo mass has
been obtained and it puts a strong constraint on galaxy
formation models see Moster et al 2013
In gure 2 we compare the simulated stellar mass frac-
tion MM200 for the central galaxies with that obtained
by the abundance matching technique taken from Moster
et al 2013 where M200 is dened as the sum of all mass
within a sphere whose average density is 200 times the
critical density We only show halos that contains more
than 100 dark matter particles since the analysis is lim-
ited to the central galaxy whose dark halos do not suer
from the tidal stripping
It is evident that the models
without AGN convert too many baryons into the stars

RP predict slightly higher stellar fractions in low mass
halos M200  1012M at redshift between 1 and 05 the
pre-SN feedback brings a better match to the result ob-
tained by the abundance matching model as suggested by
the earlier studies Aumer et al 2013 Kannan et al 2013
We note that RP lowers the galaxy formation ecien-
cies in massive halos more strongly than in low mass halos
There are two reasons why the radiation pressure feedback
operates in large halos Firstly the mass-loading of the
momentum-driven winds is proportional to 1 which is
larger than that of the energy-driven winds  2 in
large halos Secondly the metallicity is higher in larger
halos as we will show later and hence more momentum
per star formation is injected in larger halos By com-
bining all these eects our ducial model reproduces the
result by the abundance matching model quite well at all
redshifts from z  4 to 0
We have shown that there exists a combination of the
parameters that can reproduce the evolution of galaxy
stellar mass from z  4 to 0 In the following subsections

we shall examine other observables such as star forma-
tion rate and metallicity and the roles of each feedback
process We use only the galaxy stellar mass functions
and the galaxy formation eciencies to set our model pa-
rameters The properties of the galaxies in the following
subsections are simply outcomes of our simulations
32 Star formation rate
The star formation rate SFR tells us how the stel-
lar component in the galaxies is build up and how many
ionizing photons are produced In gure 3 we show the
simulated cosmic star formation rate densities as func-
tions of redshift The models that only have the stellar
feedback ie
SN and SNRP fail to reproduce the
steep decline of the SFR density toward lower redshift at
z  2 This suggests that the quenching of the gas cooling
in large halos is responsible for this decline By compar-
ing the models with and without the radiation pressure
feedback we nd that the eect of this feedback is most
pronounced at the redshift where the SFR density is max-
imum z  2 This eect makes SNRPAGN more
successful in matching the galaxy formation eciency to
that inferred from the abundance matching technique at
z  2 gure 2 As for the cosmic SFR density both
SNAGN and SNRPAGN agree with the observa-
tional constraints reasonably well
Observationally normal star-forming galaxies lie on the
so-called the main sequence of the star-forming galaxies
which describes the relation between galactic stellar mass
and star formation rate eg Brinchmann et al 2004
Noeske et al 2007 Daddi et al 2007 The normalization
of the relationship evolves with redshift while its slope
remains nearly constant The small scatter of the rela-

indicated by the black solid lines the magenta dashed line
the yellow dotted lines and the green lled triangles
tionship implies that most of the stellar mass of galaxies
have been developed along this sequence Noeske et al
In gure 4 we compare the simulated SFRs as functions
of the galactic stellar mass with the several observational
estimates at z  3 2 1 and 0 For the simulations we
estimate the SFR in a galaxy from the mass of stars that
were born in the past 100 Myr Note that we plot all
the galaxies that have non-zero SFRs Since the dier-
ence between the models is quite small except for massive
galaxies we only show the most distinctive two models
SN and SNRPAGN
We nd that our simulations agree with the observa-
tional estimates well The slopes of the median SFRs as
functions of the stellar mass not shown are  09 for
z  3 2 and 1 and  08 for z  0 also agree with the ob-
servational estimates eg Elbaz et al 2007 While the
simulated SFRs fall slightly below the observational esti-
mates at z  2 boosting the SFRs at this redshift would
result in enhancing the oset between the simulated and
the observationally suggested galaxy stellar mass func-
tions at z  1 and 05 see gure 1
The eect of the quenching of the gas cooling is seen
even at z  3 The absence of galaxies with very high
SFRs  100 M yr1 which exist in the SN-only simu-
lation may aect our predictions about sub-mm galaxies
Shimizu et al 2012 We defer the investigation of this
issue to future studies
Observationally the galaxy stellar mass at which the
SFR starts to drop strongly decreases with time eg
Cowie et al 1996 To examine when the stellar mass of
the simulated galaxies is built up we show the luminosity

stellar age for the simulated galaxies The red squares
green diamonds blue triangles and black circles indicate
SNRPAGN SNAGN and SN respectively An error
bar indicates the 16th to the 84th percentile of the distribu-
tion in each stellar mass bin The increase of the stellar age
toward the lower stellar mass from M  1095 M is a nu-
merical eect see section 4 The thick solid line indicates
the observational estimate by Gallazzi et al 2005 and thin
solid lines represent the 16th to the 84th percentile of the
distribution
weighted stellar ages as functions of the stellar mass at
z  0 in gure 5 We also show the observational estimate
by Gallazzi et al 2005 for comparison
Without the quenching of the gas cooling in large halos
the stellar age is nearly constant as a function of the stel-
lar mass The introduction of the quenching makes the
stellar age older for M  1010 M and both SNAGN
and SNRPAGN broadly agree with the observational
estimate The inclusion of the radiation pressure feed-
back does not make a big dierence that is SN and
SNRP are very similar to each other By combined
with the quenching however the radiation pressure feed-
back makes the stellar age older at 101011 M and
SNRPAGN better agrees with the observation than
SNRP All the models show the increase of the stellar
age toward the lower stellar mass from M  1095 M
This increase is caused by our stochastic treatment of the
star formation and insucient numerical resolution see
the resolution study in section 4 Our results suggest
that the quenching of the cooling in large halos is essen-
tial to explain the galaxy downsizing
33 Metallicity
We now investigate the metallicity of galaxies which is a
sensitive diagnostic of the feedback physics In particular
the mass-metallicity relation is very sensitive to the winds
properties Oppenheimer  Dave 2008 Okamoto et al
Observationally the nebula metallicity of galaxies is de-
termined by measuring a ratio or ratios of emission lines
that are usually emitted from H ii and photo-dissociation
regions These lines come from the star forming regions
In order to compare our results with such observations
Evolution of galaxy population
we employ the nebula metallicity introduced by Shimizu
et al 2013 which is dened as the Lyman continuum
weighted metallicity
In this denition only the metals
around the very young star particles are taken into ac-
In gure 6 we show the mass-metallicity relations at
z  3 2 15 075 and 0 and compare them with the sev-
eral observational estimates There are uncertainties in
dening the metallicity from a ratio or ratios of emis-
sion lines Nagao et al 2006 Kewley  Ellison 2008
We have thus converted all the data into the Pettini 
Pagel 2004 hereafter PP04 diagnostic For the conver-
sion between the PP04 and Kobulnicky  Kewley 2004
diagnostics we apply an empirical conversion of Kewley 
Ellison 2008 We use the relation by Nagao et al 2006
to convert the metallicity of Mannucci et al 2009 into
that by the PP04 diagnostic Note that because of the
uncertainties in the observed metallicity and theoretical
nucleosynthesis yields Wiersma et al 2009b the nor-
malization of the mass-metallicity relation is less impor-
tant than its slope and relative redshift evolution of the
relationship
We nd that all the models show similar slopes at high
redshift z  2 At low redshift however the mod-
els without the radiation pressure feedback have slightly
steeper proles than those with the radiation pressure
feedback These models also show stronger redshift evolu-
tion than the models with the radiation pressure This is
because the radiation pressure feedback becomes stronger
in higher metallicity star-forming regions equation 6
and therefore it slows down the metal enrichment e-
ciently Consequently the models without the radiation
pressure feedback show slightly too strong redshift evolu-
tion compared with the observations Our ducial model
SNRPAGN produces the mass-metallicity relation
that is broadly consistent with the observational esti-
mates including the slope and the redshift evolution of
the normalization because of the strong outward winds
see the left panels We note that we would obtain
slightly higher metallicity if we had included metal dif-
fusion because the diusion leads to outowing particles
losing metals to the circum-galactic medium Shen et al
2010 Aumer et al 2013 The strange bump seen in the
mass-metallicity relations at M  109M is due to the
quantized star formation and insucient resolution The
resolution study we will present in the next section shows
that the bump moves to lower mass when we increase the
resolution
4 Resolution dependence
It is important to know how simulation results depend
on an adopted numerical resolution and what parameters
we should adjust when we change the resolution For this
purpose we perform two additional simulations with the
same parameter set as SNRPAGN to which we refer
as L40N256E40 in this section but with higher and lower
numerical resolutions The simulations that employ 8
times higher and 8 times lower mass resolutions are called
L40N512E40

Fig 7 Central galaxy formation eciencies in dierent
resolution simulations The black circles blue triangles
and green diamonds represent the results from L40N512E40
L40N256E40 and L40N128E40 respectively We also show
the simulation with the same resolution with L40N512E40 but
with dierent feedback parameters and a smaller simulation
volume which is indicated by the red squares L20N256E80
L40N512E40 and L40N128E40 respectively A gravi-
tational softening length is a factor of 2 shorter longer
in L40N512E40 L40N128E40 than that in L40N256E40
We also change the star formation threshold density nth
as a function of the numerical resolution we adopt a den-
sity that is higher by a factor of 4 for a mass resolution
that is higher by a factor of 8 as done in Okamoto 2013
to improve the numerical convergence see also Parry et al
In gure 7 we compare the central galaxy formation ef-
ciencies obtained from the three dierent resolution sim-
ulations We nd that our results are converging ie the
result from the intermediate resolution simulation is much
closer to that from the high resolution one than that from
the low resolution one We also nd that the simulations
have not converged at the current resolution yet ie the
results from the high and intermediate resolution simula-
tions do not agree with each other In general star for-
mation in smaller halos is resolved with higher resolution
and hence more stars form in a higher resolution simu-
lation until a simulation resolves the smallest halo that
can form stars after reionization  108 M see Okamoto
et al 2008a and Okamoto et al 2010 When a halo is
more poorly resolved winds may more easily escape from
the halo to the intergalactic space These two factors ex-
plain the resolution dependence seen in gure 7
Since the oset is observed mainly for the low mass

the observational estimates
halos we may obtain a comparable result to the ducial
simulation L40N256E40 by enhancing the stellar feed-
back in the high resolution simulation To test this we
also show the result from the simulation whose resolution
is the same as L40N256E40 but with dierent values of the
feedback parameters In this simulation we increase the
SN feedback eciency from SN  04 to 08 and the value
of 0 in the radiation pressure feedback from 30 to 40
Other parameters are remain xed to the ducial values
In order to save the computational time we use a smaller
simulation box size 20 h1 Mpc for this simulation We
call this additional simulation L20N256E80 The result
from this simulation is also shown in gure 7 which is
comparable to the ducial simulation and consistent with
the estimate by the abundance matching technique We
have conrmed that the same conclusion can be drawn
from the galaxy stellar mass function
Next we show resolution eects on the stellar age In
gure 8 we compare the stellar ages as functions of the
stellar mass in the three dierent resolution simulations
The low resolution simulation exhibits rather old stellar
age for all the mass range The results from the high and
intermediate resolution simulations agree with each other

Evolution of galaxy population
well indicating the results almost converge for the stel-
lar age at the intermediate resolution By comparing the
three simulations we conclude the upturn in the stellar
age toward lower stellar mass is purely a numerical eect
since it occurs at much lower mass in the high resolution
simulation
We also show the high resolution simulation with
stronger feedback L20N256E80
Interestingly the re-
sult is almost identical to that from the high resolution
simulation L40N512E40 in spite of the dierence in the
galaxy formation eciency see gure 7 We note that
the stellar age is nearly constant below 1010 M in both
of the two high resolution simulations where the observa-
tionally estimated stellar age gradually decreases toward
lower mass This discrepancy seems to indicate that our
galaxy formation model is still too simple and that pro-
cesses which make the star formation time-scale longer in
smaller galaxy are required although the simulation re-
sults are still broadly consistent with the observational
estimate at 109  M  1010 M
Finally we investigate resolution eects on the mass-
metallicity relation In gure 9 we show the nebula metal-
licities as functions of the stellar mass in the three dierent
resolution simulations We nd that the slopes well con-
verge and that all the simulations show similar redshift
evolution We also nd that the bump seen at low-mass
end is purely a resolution eect The bump moves to lower
mass when we increase the resolution A higher resolution
simulation exhibits higher metallicity indicating that the
feedback eect is weaker in a higher resolution simula-
tion The high resolution simulation with stronger feed-
back L20N256E80 recovers the result from the ducial
simulation L40N256E40 The result from L20N256E80
is highlighted in the right panels which shows that it is
in fact very similar to that from L40N256E40 shown in
the right panels of gure 6
5 Summary and discussion
We have updated the galaxy formation model described
by Okamoto et al 2010 to study evolution of galaxy pop-
ulation The new model employs suppression of gas cool-
ing in large halos and momentum injection by radiation
pressure from massive stars in addition to SN feedback
We normalize the model parameters so that the ducial
simulation matches the observationally estimated stellar
mass functions and galaxy formation eciencies from z  4
to 0 Interestingly the ducial model also well reproduces
other observational properties of galaxy population the
cosmic star formation rate density the main sequence of
star-forming galaxies the stellar age-stellar mass relation
and the mass-metallicity relation over a wide range of red-
In order to investigate the roles of individual feedback
processes we have performed the simulations by switching
on and o each of them alternately The suppression of the
gas cooling in large halo which we view as a phenomeno-
logical treatment of the radio mode AGN feedback is nec-
essarily to explain the high mass-end of the galaxy stellar
mass functions and the decline of the cosmic star forma-
tion rate density at low redshift Our simple quenching
model well describes the star formation properties in mas-
sive galaxies This process makes the stellar age of massive
galaxies older and nicely reproduces the galaxy downsiz-
ing for massive galaxies with M  1010 M On the other
hand our high resolution simulations show that the stel-
lar age of the less massive galaxies is nearly constant for
M  1010 M while the observations suggest that the
less massive galaxies have younger stellar age This dis-
crepancy for the low mass galaxies might suggest that our
galaxy formation model is still too simple and we need pro-
cesses that make eective star formation time-scale longer
in smaller galaxies
When we do not consider the radiation pressure feed-
back the redshift evolution of the mass-metallicity rela-
tion is slightly too strong and the slope of the relation is
too steep at low redshift The metallicity dependence of
the radiation pressure feedback helps to make the simula-
tion result broadly consistent with the observational esti-
mates This fact provides a strong case for the radiation
pressure feedback
We nd that the introduction of the AGN-like feedback
and the radiation pressure feedback little aects the re-
sults at high redshift z  2 We thus expect that our
conclusions derived from the simulations of high redshift
galaxy population Shimizu et al 2011 Shimizu et al
2012 Shimizu et al 2013 Inoue et al 2014 which only
take the SN feedback into account still hold However the
lack of the galaxies with SFR  100 M yr1 at z  2
which exist in SN model might become a problem to
account for the sub-mm source number counts We leave
this issue for future work
The resolution study shows that the simulation results
are converging numerically although the perfect numeri-
cal convergence has not been achieved at the current res-
olution We show that from a high resolution simula-
tion consistent results with the intermediate resolution
simulation can be obtained by applying slightly stronger
stellar feedback while the AGN-like feedback is remain
unchanged We expect that we would need little change
in the parameter values if we employed even higher res-
olution because the simulation results in Okamoto et al
2010 and Okamoto 2013 nicely converged with morig
107 M for Milky Way-sized galaxies and with morig
106 M even for the Local Group satellite galaxies
The new model can apply for wider ranges of redshift
and mass than the previous model that forms too massive
galaxies in large halos in particular at low redshift This
simple model is well suited for simulations that relate high
redshift galaxy population to the local one and for studies
of coevolution of cluster galaxies and an ICM
