1 INTRODUCTION
Numerous recent resolved photometric and spectroscopic surveys of galaxies
allow us to explore a two-dimensional 2-D structure of galaxy disks resolved
along the galaxy radius and azimuth in detail Studies of disk structures have
proved them to be feature-rich eg Bastian et al 2007 Gieles et al 2008
Bastian et al 2009 Sanchez et al 2010 On the other hand simulations of galaxy
disks with hydrodynamical models are computationally costly and dependent on
the parametrization of sub-grid physics and even on the implementation methods
Scannapieco et al 2012 Additionally in the cases of late-type spirals ne tuning
of the models is needed Roskar et al 2014 and references therein An increased
spatial resolution of the simulations could be the key to the problem however
this would make galaxy models computationally even more daunting Guedes et
al 2011
In the past there was an attempt to create fast semi-analytic 2-D models
of galactic disks based on a stochastic self-propagating star formation SPSF
scenario Seiden  Gerola 1982 and references therein The SPSF approach was
shown to be suitable to form occulent spiral arms reminiscent of late-type spirals
Gerola  Seiden 1978 The properties of dwarf galaxies Gerola et al 1980
as well as larger spirals Feitzinger et al 1981 were explained by employing
the SPSF scenario Despite further developments of the grid-free SPSF variants
Jungiewert  Palous 1994 Sleath  Alexander 1995 galaxy modeling shifted
towards N-body and hydrodynamical approaches
In this study we present an updated version of the 2-D stochastic galaxy disk
T Mineikis V Vansevicius
model by Mineikis  Vansevicius 2010 The most important new features of the
updated version are the implementation of the radial prole of gas accretion onto
the disk based on the present-day mass distribution in the galaxy M33 and the
stellar dispersion across the disk These features allow us to produce realistic
radial proles of the surface brightness We also improved the model by minimizing
a number of free parameters and designing it for fast generation of the results of
resolved stellar photometry
In order to verify the model we explored an extensive grid of parameters by
comparing the model generated radial proles of one-dimensional 1-D galaxy
disk with the observed ones For the study we used the well explored Local Group
galaxy M33 The relatively unperturbed stellar disk Ferguson et al 2007 and its
favorable inclination together with the small distance  840 kpc Freedman et al
2001 as well as the low Galactic extinction in its direction makes this galaxy one
of the best laboratories for studies of the SPSF scenario M33 has the characteristic
occulent spiral arms inherent to the late-type disk galaxies Although two spiral
arms are visible in the near infrared Regan  Vogel 1994 they do not dominate
the present-day star formation pattern as can be seen on the far ultraviolet and
H images Thilker et al 2005 The abundance of observational data makes the
M33 galaxy the best target to test our 2-D model
The article is organized as follows
In Section 2 we describe the model in
Section 3 the model parameters are calibrated for the galaxy M33 a discussion of
the simulation results is given in Section 4 and nally in Section 5 the conclusions
are presented
2 THE MODEL
21 Disk geometry and time step
The disk model is divided into NR rings of equal width Mineikis  Vansevicius
2010 Each ring is subdivided into cells which are the smallest elements of the
model This subdivision follows the rule that the ring with the running number
i has 6  i cells producing a total of 3NRNR  1  1 cells in the disk This
subdivision results in equal area cells except for the central one which is smaller
by a factor of 34 The physical size of the disk model is dened by the physical
size of cells and the number of rings
We assume the size of cells to be comparable to the typical size of OB associ-
ations According to the recent ndings by Bastian et al 2007 star formation
SF is a hierarchical scale-free process highly dependent on the denitions Nev-
ertheless our model is not very sensitive to the adopted cell size therefore in this
study a cell size is set to dC  100 pc
The model integration time step tI corresponds to the SF propagation time
across the cell We assume that the SF propagation velocity is vSF  10 kms
Feitzinger et al 1981 ie it corresponds to the typical speed of sound in the
interstellar matter within a cell therefore

22 Gas accretion
Although mass accretion histories of dark matter DM halos are highly vari-
able McBride et al 2009 they tend on average to obey simple relations
McBride et al 2009 studied the Millennium simulation data and found a simple
empirical t to the average DM accretion rate The t relates the mean accretion
rate of DM to a given halo mass at a given redshift Using the higher resolution
Millennium II simulation Fakhouri et al 2010 conrmed the validity of the t
and extended it to smaller halo masses We use the results by Fakhouri et al
2010 to prescribe the DM and correspondingly baryonic mass BM build-up of
the model
The gas falling into the DM halo is distributed in the thin disk The radial
prole of the accretion is assumed to be a scaled version of the total BM radial
prole of the present-day galaxy disk
2cid82 R

AGr t 
 ADMt  
where AGr t is the radial prole of gas accretion rate Br is the radial prole
of BM density in the galaxy disk ADMt is the rate of DM accretion on the
galaxy halo and   BMDM is the primordial ratio of BM to DM Such a
denition of accretion guarantees the build-up of the present-day disk over the
galaxys life-time The metallicity of the accreted gas is set to ZA  00001
G where G is a surface gas density within a cell
23 Star formation
The star formation process in the disk is modeled by discrete SF events occur-
ring stochastically in the cells The cell can experience a SF event spontaneously
probability PS or be triggered probability PT
 Spontaneous SF probability PS this parameter denes SF events occurring
stochastically in the cells without any external inuence The spontaneous SF
sustains SF activity in the disk In this study we set PS to be very small ie 1
SF event per model integration time-step tI over the whole disk Additionally
we assume that spontaneous SF events are more probable in the cells possessing
higher gas density PS  2
 Triggered SF probability PT this parameter represents a chain of complex
processes in the cells interstellar medium molecular cloud after the SF event
has occurred A molecular cloud will undergo imminent disruption by an energetic
feedback of stellar winds expanding H II zones and supernovae explosions Despite
a negative SF feedback locally on a scale of cell SF could be triggered on a larger
scale ie in neighboring cells For the cell i which experiences a SF event in
a time step tk the neighboring cell j being in direct contact with the cell i can
experience a SF event during the next time step tk1 with a probability of PTj
At the start of galaxy simulation the SF in the disk is inhibited by the critical
gas surface density C If the gas surface density in a cell is below critical the
probability of SF event is reduced by a factor of GC As the simulation evolves
the gas density in the disk increases and SF becomes more probable starting from
the inner disk parts In the outer disk G remains small compared to C for a
longer time and denes the extent of the SF disk We note that C denes the
local density ie not averaged azimuthally as this parameter is usually derived
from observations

where  and  are free parameters In order to avoid generating unrealistic stellar
populations of extremely low mass or SFE exceeding 100 we set the lower and
upper SFE cut-os to 005 and 50 respectively Additionally if the stel-
lar population born in a cell is less massive than 100 Mcid12 we assume that the
starburst does not trigger neighboring cells because the population is on average
lacking supernovae
24 The evolution of cells
Each stellar population formed in a cell during a SF event could be well
represented by a simple stellar population SSP To track the entire SF history of
a cell the value of mass of each particular stellar population is stored in a 2-D age
vs metallicity array S The step in age tS can be set in accordance to the size
of a cell 10 Myr throughout the paper The step in metallicity 0103 dex is
predened by the used dataset of interpolated isochrones To track the evolution
of SSPs self-consistently we employ the package PEGASE-HR Le Borgne et al
2004 see Table 1 for the parameters used
The stars from any SSP formed in a cell can move to the neighboring cell
therefore arrays Sj of the neighboring cells have to be modied accordingly Stellar
spread to neighboring cells is implemented as a dispersion process The evolution
of the stellar content in the cell Si is given by
 i  DS cid88
ij  Si  Sj 
where i is the mass of a newly formed SSP DS is the dispersion constant ij
is the length of borderline between cell i and its neighbors j To prevent star ow
anisotropies near the center of galaxy which occur due to change in the length
ratios of the cell sides we correct corresponding  to keep star ows through each
side of the cell equal

fraction of stellar populations returned to gaseous content ie the last term1

25 Gas ows
Due to the small size  100  100 pc of cells covering the galaxy disk gas
masses are expected to ow beyond the cells in one time step The main structures
causing gas movement are superbubbles inated by SF feedback Following the
formulation by Castor et al 1975 on time-scale of 10 Myr superbubbles reach
 100 pc in size for a typical gas density of 20 Mcid12pc2 and SFE values of a few
percent Therefore a cell experiencing a SF event on a time-scale of 10 Myr will
be lled with hot tenuous gas causing a large part of the gas to move out of the
After 40 Myr when supernovae vanish and the superbubble inated cavity
cools down the gas returns to the cell The force driving the gas to rell the cell
is the random motion of H I gas clouds having typical velocities of  10 kms see
eg Corbelli  Schneider 1997 for the galaxy M33 Based on the arguments by
Hunter  Gallagher 1990 we estimate the rell time-scale   dC210 kms cid39

by a SF event and relling
We implemented both types of gas ows in the galaxy disk model expulsion
 Gas expulsion this is implemented simply by moving gas from the cell i
experiencing a SF event to the neighboring cells j The gas ows only to those
neighbors which have had no a SF event for the past 40 Myr

Fij  ij 
where gas ows between cells Fij depend on the length ij of the borderline
and Gi is the gas mass remaining in the cell i after the SF event The ow occurs
within one time step after the SF event
 Gas relling this is implemented under the assumption that equilibrium

3 THE MODEL SETUP FOR M33
The model parameters used for the M33 galaxy simulation are given in Table 2
The model disk radius of 12 kpc comfortably engulfs the star forming disk of M33
The presence of the RR Lyr variables in M33 Pritzl et al 2011 and references
therein implies its old age therefore the galaxy formation was assumed to start
13 Gyr ago The critical gas density for SF C was suggested to be in the range
310 Mcid12pc2 Schaye 2004 We have found that lower end values do not change
the simulation results signicantly and adopted C  8 Mcid12pc2 The 1-D radial
proles are not very sensitive to the stellar dispersion parameter therefore it
was set to 200 pc2Myr The eects of this dispersion parameter will be analyzed
in the subsequent paper devoted to the study of properties of 2-D galaxy models
An assumption was made that the radial prole of gas accretion is a scaled
version of the radial prole of total baryonic mass gaseous and stellar in the
galaxy To avoid computationally expensive iterative tting of baryonic mass
for each model we derived the radial prole by performing the decomposition of
the galaxys rotation curve The observational data of the rotation curve were
taken from Corbelli  Salucci 2007 The rotation curve was decomposed into
four mass components gaseous disk stellar nucleus exponential stellar disk and
pseudo-isothermal DM halo
The contribution of the gas disk to the rotation curve was calculated by co-
adding H I and H2 data from Corbelli  Salucci 2000 and Heyer et al 2004
respectively Helium mass fraction was taken into account by multiplying hydrogen
gas mass by a factor of 133 Corbelli 2003 has established that the mass of the
M33 stellar nucleus is in the interval 038108 Mcid12 therefore in order to narrow
a free-parameter space we assume that the stellar nucleus is a point source with
a mass of 108 Mcid12 To avoid the eects of the extended nucleus we did not t the
innermost 05 kpc part of the rotation curve

Individual
contributions from the components are also shown pseudo-isothermal DM halo cyan
squares exponential stellar disk blue stars gaseous disk green diamonds and stellar
nucleus magenta triangles
We tted the following two components
 a pseudo-isothermal DM halo with the core radius Rc and the asymptotic
rotation velocity VR eg de Blok et al 2008
 an exponential stellar disk with the central surface density S and the scale
length Re The stellar disk was assumed to have a scale height of 100 pc
Dynamical contributions of gaseous and stellar disk components were computed
using the task rotmod within the software package GIPSY van der Hulst et al
1992 which implements the method of Cesartano 1983 For each pair of the
parameters describing the stellar disk S  Re we minimized 2 by tting the
DM radial prole
The best tted rotation curve with Re  157 kpc S  470 Mcid12pc2 Rc 
102 kpc and VR  184 kms is shown in Fig 1 The derived scale length of
stellar disk is in agreement with the values derived photometrically 14 kpc in the
K -passband for the inner 4 kpc of M33 Regan  Vogel 1994 and 1516 kpc in
the Spitzer passbands at 34 and 45 m Verley et al 2009 The best-tted
stellar and gaseous disks were used to dene the radial gas accretion prole of

4 RESULTS
Comparisons of the models with observational data for the galaxy M33 are
presented in Fig 2 The models are compared with 1-D radial proles of gas
surface density H I from Corbelli  Salucci 2000 H2 from Heyer et al 2004
surface brightness in i Ferguson et al 2007 and GALEX FUV Munoz-Mateos
et al 2007 passbands and metallicity Urbaneja et al 2005 U et al 2009
The gas surface density radial prole derived from observations constrains
strongly the model parameter space due to large variation of the model gas density
radial proles especially in the inner parts of the galaxy Fig 2 panel a
The surface brightness radial prole in the i passband constrains well the stellar
mass of the models However we set the same total mass for all models thus there
are no signicant variations in the i passband radial proles except in the outer
parts of the galaxy where model radial proles span a wide range Fig 2 panel b
The GALEX FUV passband surface-brightness radial prole constrains well
the SF rate along the model galaxy radius Fig 2 panel c However this prole is
not very sensitive to the model parameters since the accretion time-scale exceeds
the gas consumption time-scale ie SF is gas-accretion regulated Elmegreen 2014

PT  034   02 For all models   2 The models possess very similar 1-D radial
proles but they demonstrate dierent 2-D patterns of the young SF regions
The metallicity radial proles Fig 2 panel d are sensitive to the model param-
eters however they are of limited use because of large scatter in the observational
Therefore to further constrain the model parameter space we used only the
gas surface density and the i passband radial proles For each model we calcu-
lated the rms deviations from both observed radial proles in the most reliable
for models radial distance range ie 27 kpc The inner region of the model
galaxy has an increasingly anisotropic grid and the outer parts are aected by the
uncertainty in the critical gas surface density C In Fig 3 we show the models
selected by rms deviations from the observed radial proles gas surface density
and i passband being less than 10
The parameter space of the selected models is shown in Fig 4 A prominent
feature of this gure is the degeneracy valley  the region in the parameter space
where reside the models selected by the 1-D radial prole procedure described
above The degeneracy valley is seen because the 1-D radial proles are derived
Stochastic 2-D models of galaxy disk evolution M33
by convolving the 2-D distributions of SF regions eg SF in the model galaxy
being smooth and inecient or patchy and ecient would produce similar 1-D
radial proles
This eect is shown in Fig 5 where four dierent models taken from the
degeneracy valley of Fig 4 are plotted Fig 5 illustrates that by increasing PT
and decreasing  values SF becomes more smooth It is challenging to break those
degeneracies by using only 1-D observed radial proles however feature-rich 2-D
model structures Fig 5 imply the possibility to solve this problem by employing
spatially resolved observations of real galaxy disks
5 CONCLUSIONS
We presented a 2-D model of galaxy disk evolution based on the stochastic
self-propagating star formation process The parameterized gas and star dynamics
together with self-consistent chemical and photometric evolution of stellar popu-
lations are implemented in the model The galaxy build-up prescription is taken
from the N-body DM simulations by Fakhouri et al 2010
We applied the model for the interpretation of observational data on the M33
galaxy and successfully reproduced the 1-D radial proles of the gas surface den-
sity GALEX FUV and i passband surface brightness and stellar metallicity We
explored possible degeneracies of the model parameters by computing the exten-
sive grid of models We have found that observational data averaged as 1-D
radial proles cannot fully characterize galaxy evolution In order to break the
degeneracies the analysis of 2-D SF region patterns is additionally required
