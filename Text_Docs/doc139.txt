Galaxy evolution is a complex process where both the inner evolution of stellar population gas
and dust and the external eects like interactions and exchanges with the environment have
to be taken into account It has been fundamental in the last years to be able to build and
use homogeneous catalogues both in the local and the far universe The observation of galaxy
morphology and kinematics as a function of the redshift is indeed necessary to disentangle the
various galaxy formation and evolution scenarios Some years ago the hyperleda extragalactic
database was designed to study the local universe from the point of view of both stellar
populations and galaxies kinematics and dynamics Today it contains homogeneous data for
about 3 millions of galaxies with for each up to 80 astrophysical parameters available We
will describe here the MIGALE project which emcompasses the HyperLeda databases plus
a series of tools developed to study the dynamical chemical and morphological evolution of
galaxies It will include in particular methods to analyse the GIRAFFE cosmological elds
IFU spectroscopy and compare them with the Local Universe
1 Scientic context
The formation of the galaxies and the stars that they are made of is one of the great puzzles of
modern astrophysics The rst surveys CFRS HDF and Keck indicate that the peak of stellar
formation should be between z 1 and z 15 Madau et al 1996 HST observations show that
at large distances z  07 the galaxies with strong stellar formation  10Myear are either
interacting systems detected by ISO  VLA Flores et al 1999 or compact galaxies Guzman
et al 1997 with the comobile density of disks decreasing very progressively with z Lilly et al
1998 However numerous fundamental questions remain unsolved for example What is the
quantity of mass accreted by coalescence when the galaxy forms  What is the importance of
galaxy interactions  How do the numerous population of compact galaxies evolves from large z
 How do we explain the stability and evolution of galaxy disks  What is the role of spiral arms
and bars  How is redistributed the angular momentum that was acquired by tidal interactions
between halos and how it is related to the disks sizes 
Therefore the observation of galaxy morphology and kinematics during their evolution and
as a function of the redshift is necessary to disentangle the various formation and evolution
scenarios It is also fundamental to understand how stellar populations evolve and what are the
associated feedback processes which could delay the gas from cooling and its collapse into disks
2 The database and the virtual instrumentation
The statistical observation of galaxy kinematics appears to be the only means to shed some
light on or even perhaps solve the puzzle of the angular momentum The building of template
samples in the local universe is also fundamental in understanding the properties of distant
galaxies For this reason we have decided to group together the two multiparametric and
multiwavelength databases HYPERLEDA local universe and GIRAFFE cosmological elds
at intermediate redshifts in the frame of the same structure of virtual instrumentation This
statistical approach will allow us to understand in particular how the Hubble sequence was
formed from distant galaxies which have a less structured morphology compared to present day
galaxies and to identify the mechanism that triggers the intense stellar formation
21 What is MIGALE 
MIGALE Multi-parametric virtual Instrument for the study of GALaxy Evolution consists of a
central node hosting in particular the LEDA catalogue of homogenized parameters and a set of
catalogues containing raw data tables updated from litterature and some large surveys some
links towards associated observational projects and archives some data mining tools to point
towards external archives and on-the-y treatment softwares developped by various associated
scientic teams and which allows us to manipulate the extracted images or spectra
MIGALE is then based on a multiparametric approach cross-identifying homogenizing and
combining data from many dierent sources in particular wide eld or whole sky samples such
as DSS DENIS 2MASS SDSS or 2dF It allows us to manage and acces the data downstream
of the telescopes archives develope new analysis tools and distributes them either as packages
or through web access
From the point of view of an external user one can for example
 select samples specifying simultaneously various constraints on numerous physical param-
in B and having a 21-cm line
eters eg select all edge-on Sb galaxies brighter than 14
measurement
 do statistical studies on large samples eg study the Tully-Fisher or Fundamental plane
scaling laws as a function of morphology or redshift study the stellar population charac-
teristics as a function of environment
 access and process template data eg extract rescale convolve and combine some avail-
able high resolution stellar spectra to mimic your own low or medium resolution observed
spectrum
 access and process data from several large surveys eg extract lter and combine subim-
ages from the DENIS and the 2MASS surveys
 use virtual instruments eg create a synthetic galaxy spectrum according to some stellar
population characteristics

22 The historical LEDA catalogue
The LEDA catalogue was built from an exhaustive compilation of litterature and thanks to its
association with some large observational projects DENIS KLUN DSS It has grown from
73000 galaxies in 1989 to about 3 millions today see eg Paturel et al 2003a It was used in
1993 to create the RC3 catalogue LEDA maintains in collaboration with NED a general index
of galaxies characterised by the pgc number It also 1 provides on the y data homogenization
and correction 2 displays on line charts and DSS images 3 produces an homogenized catalogue
of 80 astrophysical mean parameters per galaxy and 4 permits SQL access to all the stored data
The statistics for a magnitude complete sample up to B18 is given in table 1
23 The Hypercat contribution
The Hypercat concepts are at the heart of the LEDAs transformation towards HYPERLEDAs
datamining framework and now MIGALE In addition to the principle of a network database
involving several nodes driven by dierent scientic teams the Hypercat team has built up
the cornerstone of the present project the PLEINPOT package which contains the infrastruc-
ture and all the facilities from which the database and the analysis tools are constructed The
package contains many modules related to interface and data acces statistics astronomy and
image analysis Among these on nds the following possibilities at-eld correction wavelength
calibration ux calibration ux normalization extraction of a subimage either from its coordi-
nates or its name projection 2D  1D substraction of sky background removal of cosmics
mask or lter application In addition to the LEDA catalogues the HYPERLEDA site already
provides the following facilities The pixel server distributes or give access to the images from
DSS1 DSS2 DENIS I and J bands and 2-MASS J H and K bands The ELODIE library of
stellar high resolution spectra is available on-line 1970 spectra for 1200 stars with a resolution
of 10000 and a wavelength range of 410480 nm and the PEGASE simulator evolutive spectral
synthesis Fioc  Rocca 1997 is also interfaced
24 The HI catalogue and the KLUN survey
The aim of the KLUN project is to collect an homogeneous Tully-Fisher sample of 20000
eld spiral galaxies distributed over the whole sky This sample is gathered both from an
exhaustive compilation of the litterature and from a large complementary programme of 21-
cm line observations From June 2001 our KLUN programme has been accepted as the
Cosmological Key-project of the refurbished Nancay radiotelescope and is allocated about 25
of the telescope time The on-line HI archive give acces to the 21-cm line prole for  4500
galaxies Our last HI data compilation contains today 16666 galaxies from 611 references
among them 5263 galaxies observed with the Nancay antenna Paturel et al 2003b Theureau et
al 2003 This calalogue has permitted in particular a detailled investigation into local universe

25 The CAI component
The Center of Image Analysis CAI manages the MAMA multibank microdensitometer and
produces high resolution scan images from photographic plates
Its resolution is 06 arcsec
thus much better than eg DSS1 and DSS2 The whole atlas SRC-J and ESO-R covering the
southern sky as well as their corresponding catalogues will be made available in 2004
26 GIRAFFE and internal dynamics
The Girae database is devoted to the exploitation of the stellar and extragalactic spectroscopic
data provided by the GIRAFFE spectrograph This database will supply the users with  the
spectra and the deduced parameters eg
in total up to 30000 spectra in the 35 nights of
guaranted time the wide eld images resulting from the preparation of GIRAFFE observations
with their astrometry the associated images at high resolution and the photometric catalogues
GIRAFFE cosmological elds observations will produce in particular high resolution galaxy
spectra up to z1 providing detailed emission line proles H H OIII  and in the IFU
or ARGUS modes allowing very accurate galaxy internal velocity eld studies Fig 1
