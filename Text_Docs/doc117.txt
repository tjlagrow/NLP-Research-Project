Draft version November 18 2013
ABSTRACT
We present a high spatial-resolution HSTNICMOS imaging survey in the eld of a known proto-
cluster surrounding the powerful radio galaxy MRC1138-262 at z  216 Previously we have shown
that this eld exhibits a substantial surface overdensity of red J  H galaxies Here we focus on
the stellar masses and galaxy eective radii in an eort to compare and contrast the properties of
likely protocluster galaxies with their eld counterparts and to look for correlations between galaxy
structure and projected distance relative to the radio galaxy
We nd a hint that quiescent cluster galaxies are on average less dense than quiescent eld galaxies
of similar stellar mass and redshift In fact we nd only two of nine quiescent protocluster galaxies
are of simliar density to the majority of the massive quiescent compact galaxies SEEDs found in
several eld surveys Furthermore there is some indication that the structural Sersic n parameter is
higher n  3 4 on average for cluster galaxies compared to the eld SEEDs n  1 2 This result
may imply that the accelerated galaxy evolution expected and observed in overdense regions also
extends to structural evolution presuming that massive galaxies began as dense low n SEEDs and
have already evolved to be more in line with local galaxies of the same stellar mass

INTRODUCTION
The internal spatial and velocity distribution of stars
is an indicator of the manner in which galaxies have
formed assembled and evolved
In the local universe
tidal streams shells and kinematically distinct cores are
examples of archeological clues to past merging and for-
mation events eg Peng et al 2002b Emsellem et al
2007 van Dokkum 2005 Blanton  Moustakas 2009
Even coarse measures such as the average stellar surface
mass density within the eective radius 50 correlate
with the star formation rate or the mean stellar age Gi-
ant elliptical galaxies have high stellar mass per unit area
or volume and show negligible current star formation
while more diuse stellar disks and dwarf irregulars are
forming stars at sometimes prodigious rates per unit stel-
lar mass specic star-formation rate sSFR At higher
redshift analogous relations are already in place eg
Franx et al 2008 While observationally it remains
dicult to separate high-redshift galaxies into classical
Hubble-types we can now photometrically determine red-
shifts stellar masses and galaxy sizes for large numbers
of galaxies at z  2 Such studies eg Zirm et al 2007
Toft et al 2007 van Dokkum et al 2008 Toft et al 2009
Williams et al 2010 Mosleh et al 2011 have found that
quiescent galaxies are in general more dense than their
star-forming counterparts

The origin of this bi-modal distribution of galaxy prop-
erties is unclear It is possible that the quiescent z  2
galaxies are more compact because they formed when
the universe was smaller and more dense and mergers
were more gas-rich It also seems plausible that the pro-
cess which quenches star formation may be linked to a
morphological change Or perhaps the dominant forma-
tion processes dier for galaxies with dierent present-
day stellar masses Khochfar  Silk 2006 2009 2011
Dekel  Birnboim 2008 Dekel et al 2009
In general terms dissipation should result in more
compact stellar cores than dissipationless assembly eg
Ciotti Lanzoni  Volonteri 2007 Naab Johansson 
Ostriker 2009 Oser et al 2010 Dense stellar systems
once formed tend to persist through successive minor
mergers The relatively recent discovery of quiescent
massive and compact galaxies at z  2 hereafter Semi-
Evolved Elephantine Dense galaxies or SEEDs implies
that at least some galaxies have their origin in high-
redshift z  4 gas-rich mergers Daddi et al 2005
Zirm et al 2007 Toft et al 2007 van Dokkum et al
2008 Cimatti et al 2008 These mergers resulted in
many stars being formed in a relatively small volume
By z  2 these systems have low star-formation rates
and relatively high stellar masses in addition to their
small sizes re  1kpc The SEEDs therefore have ex-
treme internal stellar mass densities They do not fall on
the size-mass relation dened by local galaxies Their
evolution from z  2 to z  0 is therefore a puzzle
The most massive galaxies in the present-day universe
are located at the centers of rich clusters These galaxy
overdensities were statistically the rst to separate from
the Hubble ow and collapse and are therefore believed to
follow an accelerated timeline for the process of galaxy
formation There is some observational evidence that
Zirm et al
galaxies in the progenitors of clusters protoclusters do
have signicantly older stars and higher masses than
galaxies in the eld at similar redshifts Steidel et al
2005 Tanaka et al 2010 Might cluster galaxies having
formed earlier be even more dense than eld SEEDs
Or alternatively the fast-forward evolution of cluster
galaxies may lead to lower density galaxies in protoclus-
ters compared to their eld counterparts It is interest-
ing then to look for dense SEED galaxies in protoclus-
ters at redshift z  2
We have undertaken a NICMOS imaging program to
study the red galaxy population in a protocluster at
z  216 Broad and narrow-band imaging both in the
optical and near-infrared of the eld surrounding the
powerful radio galaxy MRC 1138-262 z  216 have
identied more than 100 candidate companion galaxies
There are surface-overdensities of both line-emitting can-
didates Lyman- and H X-ray point sources sub-mm
selected galaxies and red opticalnear-infrared galaxies
Pentericci et al 2002 Kurk 2003 Kurk et al 2004b
Stevens et al 2003 Croft et al 2005 Fifteen of the
Ly and 9 of the H emitters have been spectroscopi-
cally conrmed to lie at the same redshift as the radio
galaxy Kurk et al 2004a By obtaining deep images
through the NICMOS J110 and H160 lters which eec-
tively span the 4000A-break at z  216 we have identi-
ed a large surface overdensity of red galaxies consistent
with a forming red sequence Zirm et al 2008 In this
paper we present a more detailed analysis of the masses
and morphologies of galaxies in this eld The article is
organized as follows in Section  we describe the data
and their reductions in Section  we present the photo-
metric redshifts stellar population models and morpho-
logical ts in Section  we present the internal stellar
mass densities and other derived properties and nally in
 we discuss these results in the context of galaxy evo-
lution models We use a  M   07 03 H0  73

arcsecond is equivalent to 84 kpc All magnitudes are

2 OBSERVATIONS AND DATA REDUCTIONS
21 NICMOS Imaging
The NICMOS instrument on-board HST is capable of
deep near-infrared imaging over a relatively small eld-
of-view 51cid48cid48  51cid48cid48 In the case of MRC 1138-262 we
know that galaxies are overdense on the scale of a few
arcminutes Kurk et al 2004b Croft et al 2005 and are
thus well-suited for observations with NICMOS camera 3
on HST We used 30 HST orbits to image seven overlap-
ping pointings in both lters and one additional pointing
in H160 alone These observations reach an AB limiting
magnitude m10 10 0cid48cid485 diameter circular aperture of
m10  249 mag in J110 and m10  251 mag in H160
The same eld was imaged in the g475 m10  275 mag
and I814 m10  268 mag lters using the Wide-Field
Channel of the Advanced Camera for Surveys on HST as
part of a Guaranteed Time program  10327 Miley et
al 2006
The NICMOS images were reduced using the on-the-y
reductions from the HST archive the IRAF task pedsky
and the ditherdrizzle package to combine the images in
a mosaic The dither osets were calculated using im-
age cross-correlation and were rened iteratively Align-
ment of the pointings relative to each other was accom-
plished using a rebinned version of the ACS I814 image
as a reference The nal mosaic has a pixel scale of 0cid48cid481
Galaxies were selected using the H160-band image for de-
tection within SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 We
used a 22 detection threshold with a minimum con-
nected area of 10 pixels We also corrected the NICMOS
data for the count-rate dependent non-linearity de Jong
2006 Total galaxy magnitudes were estimated by using
the MAG AUTO values from SExtractor We show the
outline of the NICMOS mosaic in Figure 1 along with
the positions of the radio galaxy yellow star and star-
forming blue circles and quiescent red circles proto-
cluster galaxies
The J110  H160 colors were determined by running
SExtractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996 in two-image mode
using the H160 image for object detection and isopho-
tal apertures The J110 image was PSF-matched to the
H160 band We also incorporated the two ACS bands
Miley et al 2006 the Spitzer IRAC bands Un Zirm
et al 2008 and V bands from KeckLRIS z and R
from VLTFORS2 Kurk et al 2004ba H band from
NTTSOFI and J and Ks from SubaruMOIRCS Ko-
dama et al 2007 The assembly of the merged multi-
band catalog is detailed in Tanaka et al 2010
The FIREWORKS data are described in detail
22 FIREWORKS Survey Data and Literature Sample
Wuyts et al 2008
In brief the survey is KS-band
selected to 5 depth of 243 AB over an area of 113cid3cid48
In addition to the deep KS band data there is high-
quality imaging in each of the U  B V  I i z J H the
four SpitzerIRAC bands and the 24m SpitzerMIPS
band The combined multi-band catalog has been used to
measure precise photometric redshifts galaxy sizes Toft
et al 2009 and to model the spectral energy distribu-
tions to derive stellar masses ages and star-formation
rates Damen et al 2009 We have made three cuts to
the FIREWORKS sample to ensure that we are making
appropriate eld-to-cluster comparisons First since we
are comparing galaxy sizes densities we require that
the galaxies are bright enough to have a reliable size
measurement in these ground-based data Based on the
comparison of size measurements from VLTISAAC and
HSTNICMOS for the same galaxies Toft et al 2009
found that at K  215  220 the scatter between
these two size determinations increases signicantly We
therefore select only K  215 galaxies from FIRE-
WORKS Next we have made a photometric redshift cut
19  z  26 to select galaxies within the eld at roughly
the same epoch as the protocluster galaxies Finally we
select the quiescent eld population on the basis of the
specic star-formation rate logsSFR  11 yr1 We
note that after these cuts the stellar mass distribution
remains similar to our protocluster galaxy sample
For further comparison to our protocluster eld data
we have compiled a sample of z  2 quiescent galaxies
published in the literature We used four references for
this sample Cassata et al 2010 van Dokkum et al
2008 Mancini et al 2010 and Saracco Longhetti 
Andreon 2009 Saracco Longhetti  Andreon 2009
used HSTNICMOS Camera 3 as we have Mancini

et al 2010 used HSTACS imaging van Dokkum et al
2008 studied HSTNICMOS Camera 2 imaging while
Cassata et al 2010 use imaging from the WFC3IR
channel on HST
We have attempted to translate these published stel-
lar mass estimates to the same IMF Salpeter and to
the same stellar population synthesis model set Maras-
ton 2005 We have used the analyses of Salimbeni et
al 2009 see their Fig 1 to derive mean corrections
between model sets The adopted IMF also aects the
derived star-formation rates The osets in this quan-
tity are similar in magnitude to the systematic shift in
derived stellar mass eg Erb et al 2006 Nordon et al
2010 so the specic star formation rate ie the ratio of
star-formation rate to stellar mass should be eectively
unchanged
3 ANALYSIS
Here we combine the multiband photometric catalog
and the NICMOS high spatial-resolution imaging to de-
rive physical parameters for individual galaxies We pare
down the total NICMOS galaxy sample to those which
have a high quality-of-t for the photometric redshift us-
ing EAZY Brammer van Dokkum  Coppi 2008 the
spectral energy distribution using FAST Kriek et al
2009 and 2D surface-brightness prole t using GAL-
FIT Peng et al 2002a This reduces the galaxy sam-
ple from the H160-band detected total of 711 We further
restrict our attention to those galaxies which most likely
lie within the known protocluster see Section 34
31 Photometric Redshifts
The thirteen lter photometric catalog Tanaka et al
2010 was used to determine galaxy photometric red-
shifts We used the public code EAZY to t a set
of model templates to each galaxys photometric data
Brammer van Dokkum  Coppi 2008 We required
that each galaxy have at least 5 colors measured for the
photometric redshift t The set of SED templates we
used included both galaxy spectral energy distributions
and a narrow emission line spectrum EAZY uses all lin-
ear combinations of the input templates to nd the best
photometric redshift t For each t EAZY produces
the full redshift probability distribution see Figs 2 - 4
We are most interested in the galaxies detected in the
relatively small  5cid3cid48 but deep NICMOS H160-band
area Therefore we have only included sources detected
in the H160 NICMOS images For the target redshift
of z  22 the primary strong spectral feature covered
by the photometric data is the 4000A break We note
that even with 13 bands of imaging photo-zs are not
suciently precise to determine whether a galaxy is in-
side the cluster or not There are 12 spectroscopically
conrmed emission line protocluster members within
the NICMOS mosaic Of these four H and one Ly
emitters have well-determined photometric redshifts the
remaining members are generally too faint to have de-
tections in enough bands Four of the ve photo-zs are
around z  21 ranging from 18 to 21 There is one
clear outlier the H emitter with zphot  033
32 Stellar Population Modeling
Using the calculated best-t photometric redshifts we
used FAST Kriek et al 2009 to t stellar population
model templates to the rest-frame photometry These
templates consist of a grid of models drawn from the
Maraston 2005 set We chose to use the Salpeter IMF
exponentially declining star-formation histories with 
varying between 107 and 1010 years and AV between
0 and 3 magnitudes FAST calculates the best-tting
model template among the grid and thereby derives a
luminosity-weighted mean stellar age stellar mass star-
formation rate and extinction for each galaxy FAST also
outputs the 1 error estimates for each of these t pa-

the photometric redshift probability distribution upper scale centered at rest-frame 4000A
rameters We show the derived masses and their errors
for the protocluster galaxies in Table 1 We note that
the star-formation rates from SED tting are equivalent
to a dust-corrected rest-frame UV SFR and that none of
our quiescent protocluster galaxies have signicant de-
tections in the MIPS 24 m image 20693 PI Stanford
Since we are only concerned with dierentiating the qui-
escent and star-forming galaxies our results are sensitive
only to catastrophic errors in these SFR determinations
33 NICMOS Galaxy Sizes and Morphologies
NICMOS camera 3 provides good angular resolution
over its eld-of-view PSF FWHM  0cid48cid4827 To exploit
this resolution we have used the GALFIT code Peng
et al 2002a to t analytic Sersic surface-brightness pro-
les Sersic 1968 to all the H160  265 sources in our
H160-band mosaic We have used our own error map as
input to GALFIT for properly weighting the image pix-
els and have masked all neighboring objects A model
point-spread function was created for each of these galax-
ies individually by generating a TinyTim simulated PSF
Krist 1993 at the galaxies positions in each exposure
and then drizzling these PSFs together in exactly the
same fashion as for the data themselves see Zirm et al
2007 We then executed several dierent runs of GAL-
FIT We ran ts holding the Sersic index constant at
n  1 and 4 using a single model PSF for all galaxies
using a stellar PSF instead of the models and holding
the sky value xed at zero For all ts we restricted the
Sersic index n to be between 05 and 5 The range of
output t values for all these dierent runs gives us an
idea of the variance of the derived parameters due to
model assumptions We choose the best t from these
runs by applying the F-test to the resultant 2
 values
The primary source of systematic osets in galaxy pro-
le and size tting is the estimation of the local sky value
If the sky is underestimated the galaxy size can be overes-
timated particularly for small faint galaxies Therefore
we compare our ts where the sky level is a free param-
eter with those where we explicitly x the sky to zero
Many of the zero-sky ts fail to converge for those that
do converge and have comparable chi-squared values to
the corresponding free ts we can compare the output
re determinations It does not appear to be the case that
equally good ts are obtained with and without tting
the sky In those ve cases where an F-test shows the
zero-sky t to be better the sizes agree within the errors
Furthermore none of these where the zero-sky result is
comparably good are for any or our protocluster galax-
ies We note that the GALFIT sky values while non-
zero are consistently several orders-of-magnitude smaller
than the values corresponding to galaxy pixels This sen-
sitivity of the t parameters to even slight variations in
the sky highlights the importance of tting the local sky

along with the galaxy parameters even in sky-subtracted
We also note that additional scatter to the derived re
values introduced by using a stellar rather than model
PSF is about 10  20 and therefore comparable to the
scatter on the single-t measurements themselves
34 Sample Selections
We use the surface-brightness prole and stellar popu-
lation ts along with the photometric redshifts to dene
three sub-samples of the NICMOS-detected galaxies We
detail these in order of increasing restriction The initial
sample is dened by a single H160-band limit of 265 AB
and consists of 711 galaxies
341 GALFIT Sample
We ran GALFIT on the full H160-limited galaxy sam-
ple Using the distribution of GALFIT 2
 values for the
ts we identify galaxies with good quality-of-t 2

ab for these well-t galaxies We use this
ized re 
GALFIT sample in our analysis of the dependence of the
Sersic index n on radial position within the cluster see

the input sigma error maps such that the best ts have

342 Stellar Populations Sample
To select galaxies with good constraints on both the
stellar mass and star-formation rate we have selected an-
other sub-sample for the initial 711 galaxies For targets
with both good photo-z ts and narrow redshift proba-
bility distributions ODDS  090 meaning 90 of the
probability distribution is contained within the z  02
around the peak value the sample comprises 190 galax-
ies out of the 711 The photometry for these targets were
t using FAST From this set we have identied 112 with
reliably derived parameters 2
  30 based on the SED
ts for example see Figs 2-4
343 Probable Protocluster Galaxies
Finally we have identied a sample of candidate pro-
tocluster members using photometric redshifts In lieu
of spectroscopic redshifts which are dicult to obtain
for z  2 red quiescent galaxies this selection should
reject most of the interlopers We consider only galax-
ies with a robust photometric redshift as above that
have probability P z  20 at the protocluster red-
shift z  2156 We further require that these galaxies
also are members of the Stellar Populations sample
These selections result in a sample of 11 galaxies nine of
which are quiescent log10 sSFR  11 yr1 We show
the galaxy cutouts the best-t Sersic model the model

35 Stellar Mass Density
The surface volume mass density in individual galax-
ies is a fundamental property which seems to correlate
directly with the absence of star formation eg Kau-
mann et al 2003 Franx et al 2008 To measure this
quantity requires accurate total mass estimates based
on either stellar velocity dispersion or much more com-
monly the stellar mass from SED ts to the broad-band
photometry Along with the resolved surface-brightness
prole to determine the galaxy size we can calculate the
mass density We must make the assumption that light
traces mass and that there are no strong gradients in the
stellar mass-to-light ratio ie we measure ML for the
integrated galaxy light and assume that value applies to
the resolved prole in a single broad-band image
For our galaxies we calculate the average surface mass
2 within the circularized ef-
density 50 in Mcid12 kpc

4 RESULTS
41 Distribution of Internal Surface Mass Densities
We have used the combination of photometric red-
shifts stellar population modeling and surface-brightness
prole ts to calculate internal surface mass densities
for our protocluster sample We have also added data
from the literature and from FIREWORKS to construct
a well-populated density versus stellar mass diagram in
Figure 5
If the published data had a measured star-
formation rate in addition to the stellar mass we have
restricted the points plotted to those with low sSFRs
quiescent log10 sSFR  11 yr1 In cases where the
star-formation rate was not quoted explicitly we only
plot those galaxies which are described as quiescent
by the authors This distribution for both our protoclus-
ter candidates yellow circles and squares for quiescent
and star-forming and the eld sources from the litera-
ture black squares and FIREWORKS blue squares is
shown in Figure 5 For the comparison eld sample we
have restricted to FIREWORKS galaxies brighter than
K  215 and with photo-z between 19 and 26 We
have made the same redshift cut for the literature sam-
ple This redshift range approximately corresponds to a
1 Gyr epoch centered on the protocluster redshift
The mean density of the protocluster sample log
 50  99 is 05 dex lower than that for the eld
sample For the stellar mass range of our protocluster
sample 10105Mcid12  Mcid63  10114Mcid12 where the mass
distributions are similar we can calculate the distribu-
tion of the surface mass densities irrespective of total
stellar mass We have also used the KS test to calcu-
late the probability that the quiescent protocluster and

galaxies the third falls at 5  109Mcid12 The shaded regions are the local relations for early-type light red and late-type galaxies light
blue Note that most of the protocluster members have lower densities than their eld counterparts
eld densities are drawn from the same parent distribu-
tion A ducial value of PKS  5 may be considered
sucient to reject the null hypothesis that they are from
the same parent In this case PKS  5 and is there-
fore a relatively strong constraint We have perturbed
our measured densities and re-calculated PKS for 10000
trials We show the distribution of PKS in Figure 6 For
the black yellow histogram 30 60 of the realiza-
tions fall below PKS  5 Both histograms have tails
to higher probabilities
42 Radial Dependencies
In order to assess possible radial gradients in the galaxy
properties within the cluster with respect to the radio
galaxy we have constructed the histograms shown in Fig-
ure 7 For each of these four physical galaxy parameters
Sersic n value surface mass density  stellar mass
Mcid63 and specic SFR we have made a single cut in
the galaxy sample and plotted two radial histograms for
above orange and below blue the chosen cut value
The left panel of Fig 7 shows the histograms for the full
galaxy sample appropriate to each parameter ie the
GALFIT sample for the Sersic n value For the rest
the galaxies must also be in the stellar population sam-
ple The right panel shows the histograms for our proto-
cluster galaxy sample both quiescent and star-forming
We have presented these two analyses because while the
presence of eld galaxies in the larger samples will dilute
any result the statistics are poor for the quiescent pro-
tocluster galaxy sample Furthermore this eld exhibits
a factor of six surface overdensity of red galaxies Zirm
Figure 6 The KS probability distributions for the protocluster
versus eld galaxy comparison The black histogram are derived
from 10000 runs with the protocluster densities perturbed at ran-
dom within the Gaussian errors The yellow histogram is the same
but excluding the most dense protocluster galaxy The vertical
dashed line marks PKS  005 About 55 of the realizations fall
below the 5 probability

KS test to determine whether the distributions are con-
sistent with one another However for the full sample

left the Sersic n distributions are more dissimilar than
for the other parameters with a low PKS  5 This
low probability seems to be the result of a relatively at
distribution of the n  25 galaxies with radius contrast-
ing with the structure in the radial distribution of the
higher n galaxies This hint may imply a scenario in
which the galaxies are deeper within the gravitational
potential We discuss this point further below In the
future with spectroscopic redshifts for red galaxies it
will be possible to repeat this test with better interloper
rejection to see if the discrepancy between histograms is
signicant for bona de protocluster galaxies
5 DISCUSSION
We have presented the combined analysis of 13 band
photometry and high spatial-resolution NIR imaging in
the eld of a known galaxy protocluster at z  216 In
cases like this where there is a known conrmed overden-
sity and strong statistical evidence for a dominant contri-
bution from protocluster members we can make progress
despite the lack of spectrocopic redshifts We have iden-
tied a robust sample of likely protocluster galaxies Our
conclusions are tentative and tempered by the following
caveats We do not have spectroscopic redshifts for the
quiescent cluster galaxies While we have done our best
to isolate the most probable cluster members they may
still be eld galaxies The cluster sample is also relatively
small and the results are therefore more suggestive rather
than statistically robust Finally due to the limited areal
coverage of the protocluster see Fig 1 the very massive
galaxies may be underrepresented in the cluster sample
These may also be more dense
Possible stellar population model osets have been
minimized by converting the literature points to the same
models and IMF we used to t the cluster galaxies
51 Evolution of Galaxy Structure and Stellar Mass
Surface Density
From the initial discovery of SEEDs in general eld
surveys the primary question has been what evolution-
ary processes aect the SEEDs between z  2  3 and
z  0 that bring them in line with the local mass-size re-
lation If the dominant process is galaxy merging then
we might expect that most of the full galaxy mergers as
opposed to tidal interactions and harassment may have
already happened While if the primary determinant of
galaxy density is the formation redshift the young Uni-
verse being denser we might expect that cluster galaxies
will be denser than their eld counterparts having formed
earlier
In our data we see some indication for a dierence
between the prole shapes and density distributions for
protocluster versus eld galaxies Fig 5 For our sam-
ple of likely quiescent protocluster galaxies their stellar
densities are lower and perhaps even the Sersic index is
higher than for similarly selected eld galaxies From
other studies it appears that the majority of eld SEEDs
have higher axial ratios attened with n  2 van der

52 Cosmic Merger Clocks
Several previous studies have shown evidence that pro-
tocluster galaxies tend to be more massive and contain
older stars than their eld counterparts at the same red-
shift eg Steidel et al 2005 Tanaka et al 2010 This
advanced evolution in the cluster environment may also
extend to the internal structure and dynamics of the
galaxies At lower redshift we observe a morphology-
density relation and we may be seeing the beginnings
of that relation in the MRC 1138 protocluster Further-
more the lower densities of the protocluster galaxies sug-
gests that the necessary merging has also taken place at a
quicker pace than in the eld If we assume then that all
galaxies begin as dense SEEDs at high redshift we can
use the observed densities as a measure of the merger
age of the remnants A similar idea was put forth by
Hopkins and Hernquist 2010 to derive the global star-
formation history by using the mass proles of galaxies
They propose that the dense cores of galaxies form early
in starbursts and the outer parts form in a more quies-
cent mode perhaps in disks Based on the results from
this paper we suggest that the resolved mass proles can
be used further to constrain the redshift of formation and
the subsequent merger history The ratio of high-density
stellar mass to low-density stellar mass may tell us some-
thing about the merger age of a galaxy while the absolute
density of the highest density stellar components may tell
us about the formation redshift Studies at low-redshift
have already found some correlation between galaxy den-
sity and the mean stellar age eg van der Wel et al
2009 With more precise stellar ages for z  2 galaxies
now becoming available we can extend this analysis to
high-redshift when the fractional age dierences between
galaxies are larger

bottom Sersic n value surface mass density  stellar mass Mcid63 and specic star-formation rate For each parameter we have made
a single cut of the total sample into two bins and plotted those two histograms separately for those above orange and below blue this
cut The value of the cut is shown below the parameter name and the number of galaxies in each bin to the left of the name Finally the
KS probability that the two histograms are drawn from the same parent distribution is also shown
