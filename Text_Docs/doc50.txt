Abstract
We study Hawking radiation of Dirac particles with spin-12 as a tunneling process
from Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes in background
spacetimes with a spinning cosmic string and a global monopole Solving Diracs equation
by employing the Hamilton-Jacobi method and WKB approximation we nd the corre-
sponding tunneling probabilities and the Hawking temperature Furthermore we show
that the Hawking temperature of black holes remains unchanged in presence of topological
defects in both cases
Introduction
After the original Hawking derivation of black holes temperature 1 a number of dierent
approaches were introduced among others the Wick rotation method 2 3 quantum tunnel-
ing 4 anomaly method 15 and the technique of dimensional reduction 16 The tunneling
method treated Hawking radiation as a tunneling process using semi classical WKB approx-
imation where the particle can quantum mechanically tunnel through the horizon and it is
observed at innity as a real particle The tunneling rate is related to the imaginary part of
the action in the classically forbidden region Generally there are two methods to obtain the
imaginary part of the action In the rst method used by Parikh and Wilczek the imaginary
part of the action is calculated by integrating the radial momentum of the particles In the
second method 17 18 the imaginary part of the action is obtained by solving the relativistic
Hamilton-Jacobi equation The quantum tunneling method has been studied in great details for
a number of spherically symmetric and stationary spacetimes black holes and also for dierent
particles including a scalar particles with spin-0 Dirac particles with spin-12 and spin-32
particles In particular the tunneling from the rotating Kerr black hole Kerr-Newman black
hole 7 10 black hole with topological defects 8 9 22 Kerr de Sitter and Kerr-Newman de
Sitter black hole 5 black strings 6 black holes with NUT parameter 11 and many others

The aim of this paper is to extend this method for Dirac particles with spin 12 to tunneling
from the Schwarzschild-de Sitter SdS and Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter RNdS black holes
pierced by an innitely long spinning cosmic string and a global monopole The Hawking
temperature is shown to be invariant of the nature of particles
including the presence of
topological defects Topological defects may have been produced by the phase transition in the
early universe A spinning cosmic string is characterized by the rational parameter a and the
angular parameter J given by a  4J The spacetime of cosmic string gives rise to a number
of interesting phenomena cosmic string can act as a gravitational lens 19 it can induce a
nite electrostatic self-force on an electric charged particle 20 shifts in the energy levels of a
hydrogen atom 21 they were also suggested as an explanation of the anisotropy of the cosmic
microwave background radiation
This paper is organised as follows In Section 2 we briey review and introduce the station-
ary line element near the horizon for SdS black hole in the cosmic string and global monopole
background
In Section 3 we calculate the tunneling rate of massivemassless Dirac parti-
cles and the corresponding Hawking temperature from this spacetime In Section 4 similary
we introduce the stationary line element for RNdS black hole in the cosmic string and global
monopole background and calculate the tunneling rate and Hawking temperature for charged
Dirac particles In Section 5 we comment on our results
2 SdS black hole with topological defects
In order to write down the metric of Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole with positive cosmologi-
cal factor  pierced by an innitely long spinning cosmic string and a global monopole one can
introduce the rotation of an innitely long cosmic string by simply doing the transformation
dt  dt  a d 23 Therefore the line element reads

where a is the rational parameter of a cosmic string and l2  32 In this paper we will
consider an idealized cosmic string with a parameter a constant with time related to the
angular parameter J with a  4J The presence of a global monopole and a cosmic string is
encoded via p2  1  82 and b2  1  42 respectively We can sole r3  2Ml2  rl2  0
and get the black hole event horizon rH and cosmological horizon rC given by

with   127 leads to see eg 12

clearly in the limit   0 it follows rH  2M For the sake of convenience let us write the
metric 21 near the event horizon For that purpose one can dene   r2  2Mr2  r4l2
so the line element near the event horizon becomes

Due to the frame-dragging eect of the coordinate system in the stationary rotating space-
time we can perform the dragging coordinate transformation     t where

In what follows we will use the metric 29 to study the tunneling rate of spin-12 particles
from the event horizon The tunneling rate is related to the imaginary part of the action in the

In this way Diracs equation 31 can be written as
  yields   0

We are free to choose the  matrices in dierent ways let us for simplicity choose 
matrices as

As we know the state of Dirac particles with spin-12 is described by two corresponding
states spin-up and spin-down states In order to solve Diracs equation 32 we can use the
following ansatz for Diracs eld

corresponding to spin up case  and

for the spin down case  Here S and S donates the corresponding action of Dirac particles
with spin  and  A and B are two arbitrary functions of the coordinates Using the
symmetries of the metric 29 given by Killing vectors we can choose therefore the following
ansatz for the action in the spin up case
S t r     Ebp  Jbpbp t  Rr  Jbp  
here Ebp is the energy of the emitted particles measured at innity and Jbp is the angular
quantum number of the particle However since a topological defects exits the Komars energy
Ebp and angular quantum number Jbp of the particles are decreased by a factor of p2b Namely
the energy and the angular quantum number are Ebp  p2bE and Jbp  p2bJ respectively
Inserting the Eq33 into Eq32 and divide by the exponential term and multiply by  we
end up with the following four equations
A tS

At rst it seems that Eqs37 and 39 suggest that there should be a contribution to the
imaginary part of the action coming from  however one can show that the contribution
of  to the imaginary part of the action is cancelled out since the contribution from  is
completely same for both the outgoing and ingoing solutions 5 Hence only the rst and the
third equation remains to be discussed The radial part Rr of the action S can be calculated
from the following equations
ip2b A E  Jbp  BpF r G r rR  mApF r  0
ip2b B E  Jbp  ApF r G r rR  mBpF r  0
Solving rst for the massless case m  0 we get two solutions A  iB Therefore the
radial part of the action reads
Rr  Z p2 b E  Jbp
pF r G r
where  correspond to the outgoingingoing solutions Solving the last equation by inte-
grating around the pole r  rH we nd

We can now express the imaginary part of this result near the event horizon using rH 
2M1  4M 2l2   where the angular velocity vanishes ie bprH   0 this leads to

On the other hand the probabilities of crossing the horizon for Dirac particles in each
direction are given by

Since we are interested in computing the probability of Dirac particles tunneling from inside
to outside the horizon we write

 exp 4 ImR 
in the last equation we have set Plancks reduced constant equal to unity Taking the imagionary
part of Rr near the horizon the tunneling rate becomes

In order to nd the Hawking temperature of the black hole we have to compere the last
equation with the Boltzmann factor   exp  Ebp  JbpbprH  where   1TH The
Hawking temperature at the event horizon from SdS black holes with topological defects reads

l2 cid19 
From the last two equations its clear that Hawking radiation deviates from pure thermality
as a consequence there is a correction to the Hawking temperature of SdS black hole How-
ever this result shows that Hawking temperature is unchanged in the presence of topological
defects In the particular case setting l   ie   0 the Hawking temperature reduces
to Schwarzschild black hole temperature For the massive case m 6 0 using Eqs310 and
311 we get

ip2b E  JbppF r G r  mG rpF r
However near the horizon rH  2M1  4M 2l2      we get A2  B2 since F rH 
GrH  0 yielding the same Hawking temperature as in the massless case In other words
the mass m of the particle plays no relevant role in the process of Hawking radiation
4 Tunneling from RNdS black holes
The line element of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole with positive  in the background
spacetime with a spinning cosmic string and a global monopole is given by

Solving for r4l2r22Ml2rl2Q2  0 we can get the event horizon rH and the cosmological
horizon rC location Without getting into details see eg 13 after expanding rH in terms
of M Q and l with   127 it was found

where   p1  4Q2l2 By following the same arguments that have been used in the last
section we can dene   r2  Q2  2Mr2 r4l2 in this way the metric 41 near the horizon
takes a similar form as 29 since

In what follows we will use this result to study the Dirac equation and calculate the
tunneling rate of spin-12 particles from RNdS black holes in the cosmic string and global
monopole background The equation which has to be solved is the charged Dirac equation for
a particle with mass m and charge q given by
icid18   
Acid19  
where A is the electromagnetic four-potential given by A  At 0 0 0 Choosing the 
matrices as before applying WKB approximation and divide by the exponential term and
multiply by  we end up with four equations

Following the same arguments that have been used in the last section we will focus only on
the rst and third equation It should also be stressed that due to the presence of topological
defects the charge of the Dirac particles also shifts q  p2b q For massless Dirac particles
m  0 we can nd the radial part Rr of the action S using Eq45 and Eq 47 yielding
E  Jbp  qAt  BpG r rRr  0
E  Jbp  qAt  ApG r rRr  0
Similarly we get two solutions A  iB corresponding to the outgoingingoing solutions
The radial part of the action reads
Rr  Z p2b E  Jbp  qAt
pF r G r
We can solve the last equation by integrating around the pole at the event horizon r  rH 
the dragged angular velocity vanishes at the horizon ie bprH  0 yielding

Neglecting M 3 terms and its higher order terms near the event horizon and using the
electromagnetic potential of the black hole At  QrH  the imaginary part of the last equation

We therefore conclude that the tunnelling rate of the charged Dirac particles at the event
horizon is

The Hawking temperature of Dirac particles for Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in spacetime
of topological defects can be found by comparing the last equation with the Boltzmann factor
  exp Ebp  JbpbprH it follows

As expected there are corrections to the Hawking radiation but the Hawking temperature
remains unaltered in presence of topological defects In the particular case setting l   ie
  0 and   1 we recover the Hawking temperature of charged Dirac particles for RNdS
black hole without topological defects Clearly for uncharged particles q  0 the last equation
reduces to Perkihs result In the case of massive Dirac particles m 6 0 we can use Eqs 45
and 47 and get the following result

At the event horizon rH  1 1  4M 2l22      M pM 2  Q2 we get A2  B2
since F rH  GrH  0 those we have shown that the mass of the particles is irrelevant in
this process
5 Conclusion
In this paper we have extended the quantum tunneling of Dirac particles with spin 12 from
Schwarzschild-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordstrom-de Sitter black holes in the spacetimes back-
ground with a spinning cosmic string and a global monopole The Diracs equation has been
solved via WKB approximation and using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation Taking into account
the change of the Komers energy angular quantum number and charge of the particles in
spacetimes with topological defects we have calculated the tunneling rate and the correspondin
black holes Hawking temperature in both cases As a result it is shown that Hawking tem-
perature remains unchanged for massive as well as for massless Dirac particles and unaected
by the presence of topological defects in both cases The results agree in full with Parikhs
