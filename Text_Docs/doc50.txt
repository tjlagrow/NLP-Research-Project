Many types of cells can sense external ligand concentrations with cell-surface receptors at ex-
tremely high accuracy Interestingly ligand-bound receptors are often internalized a process also
known as receptor-mediated endocytosis While internalization is involved in a vast number of
important functions for the life of a cell it was recently also suggested to increase the accuracy
of sensing ligand as the overcounting of the same ligand molecules is reduced Here we show by
extending simple ligand-receptor models to out-of-equilibrium thermodynamics that internalization
increases the accuracy with which cells can measure ligand concentrations in the external environ-
ment Comparison with experimental rates of real receptors demonstrates that our model has indeed
biological signicance

INTRODUCTION
Biological cells can sense and respond to various chem-
icals in their environment However the precision with
which a cell can measure the concentration of a specic
ligand is negatively aected by many sources of noise 1
5 Most noticeable is external noise from the random
arrival of ligand molecules at the cell-surface receptors
by diusion Nonetheless several examples exist in which
measurements are performed with surprisingly high ac-
curacy In bacterial chemotaxis for instance fast moving
bacteria such as Escherichia coli can respond to changes
in concentration as low as 32 nM 6 This value is re-
markable since cells have only about one second between
tumbles to evaluate the ligand concentration 7 Fur-
thermore this concentration value corresponds to only
about three ligand molecules in the volume of the cell
assumed to be one femtoliter suggesting single molecule
detection High accuracy is observed also in spatial sens-
ing by single cell eukaryotic organisms Best character-
ized are the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum which
is able to sense a concentration dierence of 15 across
the cell diameter 8 as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae
budding yeast able to orient growth in a gradient of -
pheromone mating factor down to estimated 1 receptor
occupancy dierence across the cell 9 Spatial sensing
is also eciently performed by lymphocytes neutrophils
and other cells of the immune system 10 as well as by
growing synaptic and tumor cells
Previously the fundamental physical limits to the ac-
curacy of sensing as set by ligand diusion have been cal-
culated 1115 Recent work based on simplifying mod-
els indicates that if a cell eectively acts as an absorber
of ligand the accuracy is signicantly increased 16
Such an increase in accuracy can be explained with the
fact that absorption prevents ligand molecules from un-
binding the receptors Hence the same ligand molecule
can only be counted once by a receptor avoiding a source
of measurement uncertainty However whether cells with
realistic receptors can act as absorbers and increase the
FIG 1 Single receptor immobile at position x0 binds and
unbinds ligand with rates kc and k respectively
accuracy of sensing is unknown
Motivated by these observations
in this paper we
analyze the role of receptor-mediated endocytosis ie
the internalization of either bound or unbound recep-
tors from the cell membrane into the cell interior often
observed in eukaryotic cells 17 18
Internalization of
ligand-bound receptors eectively leads to the absorption
of ligand molecules and is therefore expected to draw the
cell nearer to the physical limit of the perfect absorber
16 Using simple models for the ligand-receptor dy-
namics we nd that the eect of receptor-mediated en-
docytosis indeed increases the accuracy of sensing ligand
concentration if internalization of ligand competes with
ligand unbinding Comparison of our results to the avail-
able literature of experimental rate constants shows that
receptors often work in this limit indicating biological
relevance of our results
The paper is organized as follows In Section II we
review the results regarding the accuracy of sensing for
a single immobile receptor without internalization
Section III we study the role of internalization using a
model of ligand-receptor dynamics with internalization
While ligand-receptor binding and unbinding is described
by equilibrium thermodynamics as previously developed
in Refs
12 20 internalization clearly introduces non-
equilibrium thermodynamics into the problem We con-
sider the limit of fast diusion ie when the coupling to
diusion of ligand can be neglected as well as the general
case both near and far from equilibrium This general
case deals with the reduction of rebinding of previously
bound ligand molecules by receptor internalization and
hence represents the main result of the work In Section
IV we analyze the results obtained in Section III and
connect to receptors from the biological literature We
conclude with nal comments and discussion An Ap-
pendix is devoted to an alternative approach leading to
the same results derived in the main text
II REVIEW OF THE SINGLE RECEPTOR
In this section we review previous results for a single
immobile receptor without internalization Details of the
method will be provided in Section III As depicted in
Fig 1 such a receptor can bind and release ligand with
rates kc and k respectively The kinetics for the oc-
cupancy nt of the receptor are therefore given by
nt
 kc 1  nt  knt
where the concentration of ligand cx t  c is assumed
uniform and constant The steady-state solution for the
receptor occupancy is given by
c  KD
with KD  kk the ligand dissociation constant The
rates of binding and unbinding are related to the nega-
tive free energy of binding through detailed balance
with T the temperature in energy units In the limit of
very fast ligand diusion ie when a ligand molecule is
immediately removed from the receptor after unbinding
the dynamics of the receptor is eectively decoupled from
the diusion of ligand molecules and hence diusion does
not need to be included explicitly
Following Bialek and Setayeshgar 12 the accuracy of
sensing is obtained by applying the Fluctuation Dissipa-
tion Theorem FDT 19 which relates the spectrum of
the uctuations in occupancy to the linear response to
a perturbation in the receptor binding energy Further-
more at equilibrium the uctuations in occupancy can be
directly related to the uncertainty in ligand concentration
using Eq 2 For a measurement performed on a time
scale  much larger than the correlation time of the bind-
ing and unbinding events the uctuations of the occu-
pancy hn2i are obtained from the zero-frequency spec-
trum divided by   Using hn2i one then obtains the
uncertainty in measuring ligand concentration c 12 20

FIG 2 Receptor with internalization In addition to ligand
binding and unbinding described in Fig 1 the receptor is
internalized at rate ki if occupied and at rate k0
i  if unoc-
cupied The internalized ligand is degraded An unoccupied
receptor is delivered to membrane with rate kr
where the right-hand side is obtained for diusion-limited
binding 20 ie when kc1n  4cD3s with D3 the
diusion constant and s the dimension of the spherical
receptor Eq 4 shows that the accuracy of sensing is
limited by the random binding and unbinding of ligand
In the case where diusion of ligand is slow ligand
binding to the receptor is aected by diusion 12 The
kinetics of the receptor occupancy and ligand concentra-
tion are described by

where x0 indicates the position of the receptor and x
x0 is a Dirac delta function centered at the receptor
location The last term in the second equation describes
a sink or source of ligand at x0 corresponding to ligand-
receptor binding or unbinding respectively Analogous
to fast diusion Eq
5 has steady-state solutions c
independent of D3 and n given by Eq 2
Following a similar procedure as in the previous case
the accuracy of sensing is given by 12 20

where the rst term on the right-hand side of Eq 6a
is the same as in Eq 4 while the second term is the
increase in uncertainty due to diusion This term ac-
counts for the additional measurement uncertainty from
rebinding of previously bound ligand to the receptor For
diusion-limited binding one obtains Eq 6b 20
Comparison of Eqs 4 and 6 shows that removal
of previously bound ligand by fast diusion increases the
accuracy of sensing since the same ligand molecule is
never measured more than once
FIG 3 Single receptor with internalization Similar to Fig
2 except that the delivery of receptor to the membrane is
adjusted so that Eq 8 is fullled This corresponds to an
instantaneous replacement round arrow of the internalized

where KM  k is a Michael-Menten-type constant
and subscript i is used to indicate the steady-state value

ization cf Eq 2
While Eq 9 could be solved immediately by analogy

the method of the eective temperature which allows us
to solve the general case in section III B Similar to the
equilibrium case at the non-equilibrium steady state the
rates can formally be related to the binding free energy

Te  T  corresponds to a decrease in the receptor oc-
cupancy approximately reecting internalization in the
non-equilibrium steady state
In order to calculate the spectrum of the uctuations in
receptor occupancy we follow Refs 12 20 and consider
small uctuations around the stationary solution

condition implies that an internalized receptor is imme-
diately replaced by a new unoccupied receptor with rate

ing ligand compensates for internalized ligand
In order to apply the generalized FDT gFDT we intro-
duce uctuations in the conjugate variable of the receptor

21 is identical to the result in Eq
4 without

In fact the removal of unbound ligand by fast diusion at
equilibrium is equivalent to removal of bound ligand by
internalization at the non-equilibrium steady state This
equivalence can be readily seen from Eq 9 which is
indistinguishable from simple unbinding with rate  
k  ki Hence the eective temperature applied here is
in fact exact
B Solution near equilibrium
When considering ligand diusion the above proce-
dure still applies with the exception that the concen-
tration of ligand is allowed to vary due to binding and
unbinding The kinetics of the receptor occupancy and
ligand concentration is described by

where   k  ki is used as before Furthermore a
source of ligand with rate k is considered at location
x so as to compensate the loss of ligand molecules due
to internalization
We note that the steady-state solution for the con-
centration is not spatially uniform but is depleted near
the receptor due to internalization This leads to the
anomaly that we mathematically evaluate the rate of
binding using the ligand concentration at x0 in Eq 22a
while physically the diusive ux and hence binding of
ligand is determined by the ligand concentration c far
away from the receptor see section III C This is reme-
died by linearizing the ligand concentration around c in
the following Furthermore Eq
8 is again assumed
valid and therefore an additional equation describing the
unoccupied receptor fraction mt with rates k0
i and kr
is redundant

The following conclusions can be drawn by compari-
son with the result Eq 6 without internalization i
Receptor internalization mainly reduces the second term
in Eq6 demonstrating for the rst time that inter-
nalization increases the accuracy of sensing by reducing
the uncertainty from rebinding of previously bound lig-
and The rst term is only reduced by replacing n by
ni with ni  n ii In the limit ki  0   1 and
the equilibrium result Eq 6 without internalization is
recovered iii As Eq 32 becomes unphysical in the
limit of ki   ie does not approach Eq 21 without
rebinding our result can only be regarded an approxima-
tion valid near equilibrium
C Comparison with perfect absorber
The perfect absorber is here dened as a receptor
which internalizes a ligand immediately once it is bound

lated from the Poisson statistics of the number of binding
events N in time

obtained from the diusive ux of ligand to an absorb-
ing sphere of radius s Comparison with Eq 21 for
diusion-limited binding without rebinding shows that
the perfect absorber is yet more accurate by a factor 2
This is due to the fact that the uctuations in occupancy
in Eq 21 stem from the random binding and unbind-
inginternalization events while the uncertainty in Eq
33 solely stems from the random binding events see
also factor 2 in Eq A2 as well as Ref 26 for further
explanation
IMPLICATIONS FOR BIOLOGY
In the previous section we showed that internalization
increases the accuracy of sensing by reducing the mea-
surement uncertainty from rebinding of previously bound
ligand In this section we review some receptors of known
rate constants We specically would like to determine
if the rate of internalization ki is fast enough ie com-
parable to the unbinding rate k in order to eectively
increase the accuracy of sensing
In Table I we summarize experimental values for rate
constants including internalization of various receptors
Most G-protein coupled receptors GPCR undergo in-
ternalization 18 The Ste2 receptor in haploid yeast cells
of -mating type is involved in  pheromone sensing and
signal transduction leading to cell polarization shmoo
formation and mating The folate receptor FR in Dic-
tyostelium likely a GPCR 27 28 is used to sense and
hunt bacteria The folate-binding protein in mammalian
cells is a diagnostic marker for various cancers and its
internalization is exploited for drug delivery into cancer-
ous human cell 29 However the cAR1 receptor in Dic-
tyostelium used for sensing of cAMP under starvation is
not internalized 30 The epidermal growth factor recep-
tor EGFR a tyrosine kinase is another important ex-
ample of a receptor which is internalized 31 This recep-
tor is involved in cell growth proliferation and dieren-
tiation 3133 Another class of internalized receptors is
involved in uptake Transferrin receptor TfR is used for
iron uptake from extracellular space and plays therefore
an important role in blood cells 31 Transferrin binds
to TfR is internalized and releases its iron load through
ion pump-induced pH reduction The ligand-bound TfR
is then recycled back to cell surface Another example is
the low density lipoprotein receptor LDLR 31 When
bound to LDL-cholesterol via adaptin LDLR is inter-
nalized via clathrin-coated vesicles 31 Furthermore
the vitellogenin receptor VtgR is involved in oogenesis
egg-formation 31 Once internalized vitellogenin is
turned into yolk proteins Ligand-free receptors are re-
cycled back to cell surface Table I shows that in most
cases ki is of the same order or larger than k except
for FR where internalization is much slower than the
unbinding of the ligand from the receptor

TABLE I Summary of experimental data for relevant receptor rates discussed in the main text  However other values have
been reported as well 41 This rate is measured for folate-binding protein in cancerous mice cells not in Dictyostelium
Figure 4 visualizes the contribution of internalization
to the accuracy of sensing for the receptors from Table
I The faster the internalization the larger the increase
of the accuracy of sensing However internalization can
only reduce the second term in Eq 6a from rebind-
ing of previously bound ligand not the rst term from
random binding and unbinding To illustrate the rela-
tive contribution of the two terms we plot the square
root of their ratio in Fig 4 lled bars This shows
that in most cases in which internalization occurs the
noise ratio of the two terms is signicant ranging from
few hundredths to order of unity Hence internalization
can lead to a substantial increase in the accuracy of sens-
ing However measured rate constants are substantially
uncertain see below and diusion coecients of small
ligand molecules range from 01m2s in the synaptic
cleft between neurons 39 to 1  10m2s in blood 40
to 300m2s in water 16
In order to avoid this un-
certainty in parameters we also plot the upper limit of
the noise ratio for diusion-limited binding equal to 2
dashed line in Fig 4 Removal of the second noise
term in this limit by internalization would increase the
accuracy in Eq 6b by a factor 3 In Fig 4 we also
show the strength of internalization dened by the ratio
of internalization and unbinding rates open bars

stants Rate constants are generally obtained through
radioactive labeling of ligand with the isotope choice

between the intensity at the surface and inside the cell is
measured and from the slope of the time variation of this
ratio ki is determined 43 This method though does
not take into account recycling diacytosis of the recep-
tor which is a recurrent feature of the internalization
process also included in our model These shortcom-
ings as well as the variability associated with dierent
cell preparations lead to a large error in the rate deter-
mination  20 42 and variability between dierent
measurements 20-90 Other measurement methods
employed in experiments include protease sensitivity as-
says 44 and destination assays 45
Many examples in fact suggest a direct relation be-
tween ligand internalization and the accuracy of sens-
ing measured by the sensitivity of cell polarization or
cell movement in shallow chemical gradients These in-
clude sensing of -factor by budding yeast 37 38 fo-
late by Dictyostelium 27 and PDGF by broblasts 46
Other examples relate to embryonic development In ze-
brash primordial germ cells migrate toward chemokine
SDF-1a that binds and activates the receptor CXCR4b
It was recently shown that ligand-induced CXCR4b in-
ternalization is required for precise arrival of germ cells
at their target destination 47 During Drosophila oo-
genesis border cells perform directional migration 32
EGFR together with two other receptor tyrosine kinases
is the main guidance receptor Recent work in this sys-
tem provided compelling evidence that guided cell move-
ment also requires spatial control of signaling events by
endocytic dynamics 48 49
V DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we analyzed the role of receptor internal-
ization in the accuracy of sensing ligand concentration
By extending equilibrium single receptor models to non-
equilibrium thermodynamics introduced by internaliza-
tion we derived expressions for the uncertainty in sens-
ing ligand concentration As expected internalization
of ligand-bound receptors makes the cell act similarly to
an absorber and increases the accuracy of sensing We
then analyzed relevant experimental data summarized
in Table I and concluded that in most cases the con-
tribution of receptor internalization to the increase in
accuracy of sensing is non-negligible However a per-
fect absorber is yet more accurate as its uncertainty only
stems from random binding events not from additional
random unbinding and internalization events Whether
cells have developed mechanisms to approach the limit
of the perfect absorber eg by internalization is not
clear yet However since the accuracy of concentration
sensing can always be improved by increasing the av-
eraging time one might expect that receptor internal-
ization becomes increasingly important when time is of
the essence
In addition to chemotaxis embryonic de-
velopment may be a biological system for which receptor
internalization is important Specically the Fgf8 mor-
phogen which regulates tissue dierentiation and mor-
phogenesis in zebrash forms exponential concentration
gradients by diusion and degradation the latter being
achieved precisely by receptor internalization 50 How-
ever based on our results internalization may also be
used for the accurate readout of the gradient in the short
amount of time dictated by cell division
Cells generally have many receptors to estimate ex-
ternal concentrations of chemicals leading to a spatial
averaging and consequently further increase in the accu-
racy of sensing However even the employment of many
receptors cannot increase the accuracy of sensing beyond
the physical limit of the perfect absorber26 In fact a
cell only needs a relatively small number of receptors to
achieve an accuracy comparable to the physical limit 7
On the downside if a cell uses many receptors it needs
to integrate this information in signaling pathways
this process is fundamentally limited by noise as well
then this noise provides an upper limit on the overall
estimation performance
Although we analyzed the role of receptor internaliza-
tion in increasing the accuracy of sensing it is important
to stress that internalization fullls several other known
purposes in cells 51 Among them are i redistribution
of receptors to dierent locations on the cell membrane
ii uptake of nutrients and chemicals iii signaling by
ligand in cell interior and iv turning o persistent sig-
nal as part of adaptation All these aspects would need
to be considered to fully characterize the working of a
receptor
In order to derive the accuracy of sensing with internal-
ization we made a number of simplifying assumptions
In our model we neglected other possible sources of uc-
tuations such as uctuations in receptor density in order
to relate our results to the single immobile receptor Fur-
thermore we introduced the eective temperature Te to
generalize the FDT to non-equilibrium thermodynamics
While Te is well dened for well separated time scales
a potential time or frequency dependence of Te 2224
was neglected here However our non-equilibrium result
with internalization is consistent with the equilibrium re-
sult in the fast diusion limit Removal of ligand by fast
diusion at equilibrium is equivalent to removal of bound
ligand by internalization at the non-equilibrium steady
state providing condence in our method
Internalization is not the only mechanism by which a
cell can act as an absorber and increase its accuracy of
sensing Other potential mechanisms include enzymatic
degradation of ligand at the cell surface eg degra-
dation of cAMP by mPDE in Dictyostelium and of -
mating pheromone by Bar1 in budding yeast 52 53
Furthermore at excitatory neural synapses fast diusion
of AMPA receptors on the post-synaptic membrane sur-
face has an important role in the sensing of neurotrans-
mitter glutamate 54 Ligand-bound desensitized re-
ceptors diuse away and are replaced by fresh receptors
leading to fast recovery and readiness for the next action
potential and release of neurotransmitter By the same
mechanism the accuracy of sensing may be increased
since ligand-bound receptors diuse away and release lig-
and far away from region of signaling thus preventing an
overcounting of same ligand molecules 55
