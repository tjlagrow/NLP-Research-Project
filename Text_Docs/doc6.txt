Dust plays crucial roles in galaxy formation and evolution. In
Abstract.
the early epoch of galaxy evolution dust is only supplied by supernovae (SNe).
With the aid of a new physical model of dust production by SNe, we constructed
a model of dust emission from forming galaxies. We show the evolution of
the spectral energy distribution (SED). Then we adopt this model to a local
starbursting dwarf galaxy SBS 0335−052. Further we discuss the SEDs of high
redshift galaxies, and consider their observational feasibility.
Introduction
Active star formation (SF) is followed by heavy element production from the
birth and death of stars. Since the produced heavy elements generally exist in
the form of dust grains, the dust grains absorb ultraviolet (UV) light and re-emit
it in the far infrared (FIR).
Indeed, there is an extreme category of high-z galaxies which have large
amount of dust and are extremely luminous in the FIR and submillimeter
(submm) wavelengths. Heavily hidden SF is suggested in these galaxies (e.g.,
Takeuchi et al. 2001a,b). By examining the luminosity functions (LFs) at UV
and FIR from GALEX and IRAS/Spitzer, Takeuchi, Buat, & Burgarella (2005)
proved that the FIR LF shows much stronger evolution than that of UV, though
both evolve very strongly. This indicates that the fraction of hidden SF rapidly
increases toward higher redshifts up to z ∼ 1. There is another important
observable closely related to the dust emission from galaxies: the cosmic IR
background (CIB). Recently, Takeuchi et al. (2006) constructed the IR spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the Local Universe. The energy emitted in the IR
is 25–30% of the total energy budget. In contrast, the IR (from near/mid-IR
to millimeter) contribution is roughly (or even more than) a half in the CIB
spectrum (e.g., Dole et al. 2006). This also suggests a strong evolution of the
IR contribution to the cosmic SED in the Universe. Thus, understanding the
radiative physics of dust is a fundamental task to have an unbiased view of the
cosmic SF history.
In general, the IR observational data are obtained from photometric mea-
surements. Then, estimating the total IR luminosity from ﬂuxes at discrete
photometric bands is an essential step to discuss the energy budget released in
the UV and FIR. Since Takeuchi et al. (2005a) demonstrated good linear rela-
tions between MIR and total IR luminosities for several orders of magnitudes in
luminosity, We may expect to have a good estimator, at least with a precision
Takeuchi
with a factor of ﬁve. However, as well known, this is not a trivial task. Various
estimators have been proposed based on IRAS bands, including the classical FIR
(using 60 and 100 µm: Helou et al. 1988), Dale et al.’s TIR (60 and 100 µm:
Dale et al. 2001b), and its revised version (25, 60, and 100 µm: Dale & Helou
2002), and Sanders & Mirabel’s IR (all IRAS bands: Sanders & Mirabel 1996).
Takeuchi et al. (2005a) examined these four estimators using a galaxy sample
with known SEDs, and showed that they work well for normal galaxies. How-
ever, there are a few categories of galaxies for which the FIR-based ones (the
former two) do not give a good estimate. We focus on one of these galaxies, i.e.,
actively star-forming galaxies, and try to model their SEDs.
Throughout this paper, we use a cosmological parameter set of (h, Ω0, λ0) =
(0.7, 0.3, 0.7), where h ≡ H0/100 [km s−1Mpc−1].
2. SED Model for Forming Galaxies
2.1. Species and size distribution of dust grains produced by SNe II
Nozawa et al. (2003, hereafter N03) investigated the formation of dust grains
in the ejecta of Population III SNe (SNe II and PISNe, whose progenitors are
initially metal-free), taking into account the following aspects: (i) the time evo-
lution of gas temperature is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation
including the energy deposition of radioactive elements. (ii) the radial density
proﬁle of various metals is properly considered, and (iii) unmixed and uniformly
mixed cases in the He core are considered. In the unmixed case, the original
onion-like structure of elements is preserved, and in the mixed case, all the el-
ements are uniformly mixed in the helium core. Takeuchi, Buat, & Burgarella
(2005) showed that the unmixed dust production is preferred to reproduce the
SED of a local starbursting dwarf galaxy SBS 0335−052 (discussed below). In
addition, Hirashita et al. (2005) proved that the unmixed scenario can also re-
produce the extinction curve of a high-redshift quasar. Hence, in the following,
we only discuss the unmixed case. The size of the grains spans a range of
three orders of magnitude, depending on the grain species. The size spectrum
summed up over all the grain species has a very broad distribution, and very
roughly speaking, it might be approximated by a power law.
2.2. Star formation, chemical evolution, and dust production
For constructing the chemical evolution model of a young galaxy, we adopt the
following assumptions:
1. We use a closed-box model, i.e., we neglect an infall and outﬂow of gas in
the scale of a star-forming region.
2. For the initial mass function (IMF), we adopt the Salpeter IMF (Salpeter
1955): φ(m) ∝ m−2.35, with mass range of (ml, mu) = (0.1 M⊙, 100 M⊙).
3. We neglect the contribution of SNe Ia and winds from low-mass evolved
stars to the formation of dust, because we consider the timescale younger
than 109 yr.
Dust Emission Model for Very Young Galaxies
4. The interstellar medium is treated as one zone, and the growth of dust
grains by accretion is neglected. Within the short timescale considered
here, it can be assumed safely.
5. We also neglect the destruction of dust grains within the young age con-
sidered (see e.g., Jones, Tielens, & Hollenbach 1996).
6. We assumed a constant SFR for simplicity.
Using these assumptions, we calculate the chemical evolution.
2.3. SED construction
In this subsection, we present the construction of the SED from dust. All the de-
tails of the calculations are presented in Takeuchi et al. (2003), Takeuchi & Ishii
(2004b), and Takeuchi et al. (2005a).
(hereafter T03, T04 and T05, respec-
tively).
1. Stochastic heating of very small grains
Very small grains cannot establish thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation ﬁeld. This is called stochastic heating. To treat the eﬀect, we
applied a multidimensional Debye model (e.g., Draine & Li 2001) to the
speciﬁc heats of the grain species.
2. Emission
The emission from dust is calculated basically according to Draine & Anderson
(1985) (see T03). Total dust emission is obtained as a superposition of the
emission from each grain species. We constructed Q(a, λ) of each grain
species from available experimental data via Mie theory.
3. Extinction
Self-absorption in the MIR for a very optically thick case is treated by a
thin shell approximation (see T04).
3. Results
3.1. Evolution of infrared SED
We ﬁrst show the evolution of the IR SED of forming galaxies. For these
calculation we adopted the star formation rate SFR = 1 M⊙ yr−1. We adopt
rSF = 30 pc and 100 pc. These values are relevant when describing ‘dwarf-like’
young galaxies. The results are presented in Figure 11. We calculated the evo-
lution of the SED in the age range of 106.5–108 yr. After 107.25 yr, the N–MIR
continuum is extinguished by the self-absorption in the case of rSF = 30 pc. In
contrast, the self-absorption is not signiﬁcant for rSF = 100 pc. The SEDs have
their peaks at a wavelength λ ≃ 20–30 µm, which is much shorter than those of
dusty giant galaxies at z = 1–3 detected by SCUBA.

4. Discussion
4.1. Nearby forming dwarf galaxy SBS 0335−052
It is still a diﬃcult task to observe galaxies in their very ﬁrst phase of the
SF, especially to detect their dust emission directly. Since a recent observa-
tion of SBS 0335−052 by Spitzer has been reported (Houck et al. 2004), it is
timely to reconsider these ‘textbook objects’ with new datasets.
In addition,
understanding the SEDs of these objects will shed light to the physics of inter-
stellar matter and radiation of high-z galaxies also via empirical studies (e.g.,
Takeuchi, Yoshikawa, & Ishii 2003; Takeuchi et al. 2005b).
SBS 0335−052 is a local galaxy (∼ 54 Mpc) with SFR = 1.7 M⊙ yr−1
(Hunt, Vanzi, & Thuan 2001) and extremely low metallicity Z = 1/41 Z⊙. This
galaxy is known to have an unusual IR SED and strong ﬂux at N–MIR. It has
a very young starburst (age ∼< 5 Myr) without signiﬁcant underlying old stellar
population (Vanzi et al. 2000). T03 have modeled the SED of SBS 0335−052
and reported a good agreement with the available observations at that time.
However, Houck et al. (2004) presented new data of the MIR SED by Spitzer,
and reported a deviation of the model by a factor of two or three. Their ob-
servation indicated that SBS 0335−052 has even more FIR-deﬁcient SED than
ever thought. Hence, it is interesting to examine whether our present model can
reproduce the extreme SED of this galaxy.
We show the model SEDs for SBS 0335−052 in Figure 2. We have calcu-
lated the SED for rSF = 10, 20, and 30 pc. The SFR is ﬁxed to be 1.7 M⊙ yr−1,
and the age is 106.5 yr. Details of the observational data are found in T03
and T05. In the FIR regime, our model SEDs are consistent with the strong

SBS 0335−052.
The model for the SED of a nearby star-forming dwarf galaxy
constraint given by Houck et al. (2004). At MIR, though we cannot give an ex-
cellent ﬁt to the observed data, the model SEDs roughly agree with them. The
very strong N–MIR continuum of SBS 0335−052 is well reproduced. The dust
mass calculated by our model at this age of SBS 0335−052 is 1–2 × 103 M⊙,
consistent with the observationally estimated value by Dale et al. (2001a). We
note that the mass estimation is strongly dependent on the assumed dust species
and their emissivities, and grain size distribution. As we discussed in Section 3.,
the continuum radiation in the N–MIR is dominated by stochastically heated
dust emission, which is completely diﬀerent from modiﬁed blackbody. There-
fore, when we try to estimate the dust mass, we must take care to determine
the corresponding grain properties, i.e., radiative processes and grain which are
related to the observed SED of galaxies.
4.2. Lyman-break galaxies
Even in LBGs, there is clear evidence that they contain non-negligible amount
of dust (e.g., Adelberger & Steidel 2000). A high dust temperature (∼> 70 K) is
suggested by subsequent studies (e.g., Ouchi et al. 1999; Chapman et al. 2000;
Sawicki 2001). To make a consistent picture of the dust emission from LBGs, we
investigate the expected appearance of the LBGs with an improved dust grain
formation of N03.
We set the input parameters of the SED model for LBGs as follows. The
SFR of LBGs spreads over the range of SFR ≃ 1–300 M⊙yr−1 with a median
of SFR ≃ 20 M⊙yr−1 (e.g., Erb et al. 2003). Thus, the basic framework of the
T03 model is also valid for LBGs. In this work, we consider the moderate case of
SFR = 30 M⊙yr−1 over the age of 106.5–108 yr. The most important information
to calculate the IR SED is the eﬀective size of the star forming region, but it
is the most uncertain quantity (see T04). Since the mean half-light radius of
LBGs is estimated to be ∼ 1.6 kpc from HST observations (Erb et al. 2003), we
use the galaxy radius as the radius of a star-forming region, and set rSF = 2 kpc
according to T04.

We show the observed IR/submm SEDs of LBGs at z = 2, 3, and 4 in
Figure 3. For simplicity we only show the SED with the age of 108 yr. The
thick black short horizontal lines indicate the 3-σ detection limits for 8-hour
observation by ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array). Here we assumed 64
antennas and three wavelength bands, 450, 850, and 1080 µm. We also show
the 3-σ source confusion limit of Herschel at 75, 160, 250, and 350 µm bands by
thick gray horizontal lines. These limits are based on ‘the photometric criterion’
of (Lagache, Dole, & Puget 2003) (see also Takeuchi & Ishii 2004a).
As discussed in T04, the detectability of LBGs is not strongly dependent on
their redshifts. Detection at 350 µm seems impossible for moderate-SFR LBGs.
However at longer wavelengths, if the age ∼> 108 yr and SFR ∼> 30 M⊙ yr−1,
LBGs can be detected at a wide range of redshifts in the submm by ALMA
deep survey. In the FIR, Herschel will detect the dust emission from LBGs at
z ≃ 2, but diﬃcult at higher-z.
4.3. Toward higher redshifts
Based on the above discussions, we give a brief consideration on the observation
of very high-z galaxies (z ∼> 5) here. In modern hierarchical structure formation
scenarios, it would be more reasonable to assume a small, subgalactic clump
as a ﬁrst forming galaxy. Consider a dark halo of mass ∼ 109 M⊙, then it is
expected to contain a gas with mass ≃ 108 M⊙. If gas collapses on the free-fall
timescale with an eﬃciency of ǫSF (we assume ǫSF = 0.1), we obtain the following
evaluation of the SFR (Hirashita & Hunt 2004):
SFR ≃ 0.1(cid:18) ǫSF
0.1(cid:19)(cid:18) Mgas
107 M⊙(cid:19)3/2(cid:18) rSF
100 pc(cid:19)−3/2
[M⊙yr−1] .
If Mgas ≃ 108 M⊙, we have SFR ≃ 3(rSF/100 pc)−3/2 M⊙ yr−1. In addition,
an extremely high-z galaxy observed by HST has a very compact morphol-
ogy (Kneib et al. 2004). We also mention that, from a theoretical side, high-z
galaxies are suggested to be dense and compact compared to nearby galax-
ies (e.g., Hirashita & Ferrara 2002). Thus, we consider a dwarf galaxy with
SFR = 10 M⊙yr−1 as an example, and we adopt rSF = 30 pc and 100 pc. The
age is set to be 107 yr. If the age is older, they will become easier to detect if
Dust Emission Model for Very Young Galaxies
a constant SFR takes place. We show the expected SEDs for such galaxies at
z = 5, 10, and 20 in Figure 4. As expected, it seems almost impossible to detect
such objects by Herschel or ALMA.
Figure 4.
The expected ﬂux densities of a dwarf star-forming galaxy located
at z = 5, 10, and 20. Solid lines represent the SEDs for rSF = 30 pc and dotted
lines for rSF = 100 pc.
There is, however, a hope to observe such a small forming galactic clump
directly: gravitational lensing works very well as a natural huge telescope. If we
assume a lens magniﬁcation factor of 40, such a small galaxy becomes detectable
(thin lines in Figure 4). Since the expected SED of such a compact dwarf
galaxy has a strong MIR continuum at their rest frame, it can be feasible to
detect at the FIR in the observed frame. A cooled FIR space telescope is more
suitable for such observations, and this will be a strong scientiﬁc motivation
for a future project like SPICA. At higher-z, they can be detectable by ALMA
survey. Even at z ≃ 20, they can be detected by a standard 8-hour survey
of ALMA, if a lensing takes place. For a practical use, we must estimate how
frequently such lensing events occur for high-z objects. Suppose a cluster of
galaxies at zl ≃ 0.1–0.2 whose dynamical mass Mdyn is 5 × 1014 M⊙ and whose
mass distribution obeys the singular isothermal sphere. We denote the strong
lensing cross section, i.e., the area of the region in the source plane for which the
resulting magniﬁcation by a cluster is larger than µ, as σ(> µ). Perrotta et al.
(2002) presented σ(> µ) as a function of Mdyn for zlens = 1.0. Since σ(> µ) ∝
2 (Dls is the angular-diameter distance between the lens and the source),
we can convert their result to our condition and obtain σ(> 10) ≃ 30 arcsec2
on the source plane. This result is almost independent of the source redshifts.
Setting the limiting ﬂux density Sν = 1 µJy and using the number counts of
Hirashita & Ferrara (2002) for galaxies at z > 5, we have an expected number
of galaxies suﬀering a strong lensing to be ≃ 1–3. Thus, we expect at least a
few strongly lensed IR galaxies to this survey depth.
5. Conclusion
With the aid of a new physical model of dust production by SNe developed by
N03, we constructed a model of dust emission from a very young galaxies.
Takeuchi
The SED of a local starbursting dwarf galaxy, SBS 0335−052, was calcu-
lated. Our present model SED naturally reproduces the strong N–MIR contin-
uum and the lack of cold FIR emission of SBS 0335−052. Then we calculated the
evolution of the SED of LBGs. Finally, we considered the observations of forming
galaxies at z ∼> 5. For small forming galaxies with a gas mass Mgas ≃ 108 M⊙,
it is almost impossible to detect their intrinsic ﬂux by ALMA or Herschel. How-
ever, the gravitational lensing is found to be a very eﬀective tool to detect such
small star-forming galaxies at z ∼> 5.
