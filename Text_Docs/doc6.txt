Dust plays crucial roles in galaxy formation and evolution In
Abstract
the early epoch of galaxy evolution dust is only supplied by supernovae SNe
With the aid of a new physical model of dust production by SNe we constructed
a model of dust emission from forming galaxies We show the evolution of
the spectral energy distribution SED Then we adopt this model to a local
starbursting dwarf galaxy SBS 0335052 Further we discuss the SEDs of high
redshift galaxies and consider their observational feasibility
Introduction
Active star formation SF is followed by heavy element production from the
birth and death of stars Since the produced heavy elements generally exist in
the form of dust grains the dust grains absorb ultraviolet UV light and re-emit
it in the far infrared FIR
Indeed there is an extreme category of high-z galaxies which have large
amount of dust and are extremely luminous in the FIR and submillimeter
submm wavelengths Heavily hidden SF is suggested in these galaxies eg
Takeuchi et al 2001ab By examining the luminosity functions LFs at UV
and FIR from GALEX and IRASSpitzer Takeuchi Buat  Burgarella 2005
proved that the FIR LF shows much stronger evolution than that of UV though
both evolve very strongly This indicates that the fraction of hidden SF rapidly
increases toward higher redshifts up to z  1 There is another important
observable closely related to the dust emission from galaxies the cosmic IR
background CIB Recently Takeuchi et al 2006 constructed the IR spectral
energy distribution SED of the Local Universe The energy emitted in the IR
is 2530 of the total energy budget In contrast the IR from nearmid-IR
to millimeter contribution is roughly or even more than a half in the CIB
spectrum eg Dole et al 2006 This also suggests a strong evolution of the
IR contribution to the cosmic SED in the Universe Thus understanding the
radiative physics of dust is a fundamental task to have an unbiased view of the
cosmic SF history
In general the IR observational data are obtained from photometric mea-
surements Then estimating the total IR luminosity from uxes at discrete
photometric bands is an essential step to discuss the energy budget released in
the UV and FIR Since Takeuchi et al 2005a demonstrated good linear rela-
tions between MIR and total IR luminosities for several orders of magnitudes in
luminosity We may expect to have a good estimator at least with a precision
Takeuchi
with a factor of ve However as well known this is not a trivial task Various
estimators have been proposed based on IRAS bands including the classical FIR
using 60 and 100 m Helou et al 1988 Dale et als TIR 60 and 100 m
Dale et al 2001b and its revised version 25 60 and 100 m Dale  Helou
2002 and Sanders  Mirabels IR all IRAS bands Sanders  Mirabel 1996
Takeuchi et al 2005a examined these four estimators using a galaxy sample
with known SEDs and showed that they work well for normal galaxies How-
ever there are a few categories of galaxies for which the FIR-based ones the
former two do not give a good estimate We focus on one of these galaxies ie
actively star-forming galaxies and try to model their SEDs
Throughout this paper we use a cosmological parameter set of h 0 0

2 SED Model for Forming Galaxies
21 Species and size distribution of dust grains produced by SNe II
Nozawa et al 2003 hereafter N03 investigated the formation of dust grains
in the ejecta of Population III SNe SNe II and PISNe whose progenitors are
initially metal-free taking into account the following aspects i the time evo-
lution of gas temperature is calculated by solving the radiative transfer equation
including the energy deposition of radioactive elements ii the radial density
prole of various metals is properly considered and iii unmixed and uniformly
mixed cases in the He core are considered In the unmixed case the original
onion-like structure of elements is preserved and in the mixed case all the el-
ements are uniformly mixed in the helium core Takeuchi Buat  Burgarella
2005 showed that the unmixed dust production is preferred to reproduce the
SED of a local starbursting dwarf galaxy SBS 0335052 discussed below In
addition Hirashita et al 2005 proved that the unmixed scenario can also re-
produce the extinction curve of a high-redshift quasar Hence in the following
we only discuss the unmixed case The size of the grains spans a range of
three orders of magnitude depending on the grain species The size spectrum
summed up over all the grain species has a very broad distribution and very
roughly speaking it might be approximated by a power law
22 Star formation chemical evolution and dust production
For constructing the chemical evolution model of a young galaxy we adopt the
following assumptions
1 We use a closed-box model ie we neglect an infall and outow of gas in
the scale of a star-forming region
2 For the initial mass function IMF we adopt the Salpeter IMF Salpeter
1955 m  m235 with mass range of ml mu  01 M 100 M
3 We neglect the contribution of SNe Ia and winds from low-mass evolved
stars to the formation of dust because we consider the timescale younger
than 109 yr
Dust Emission Model for Very Young Galaxies
4 The interstellar medium is treated as one zone and the growth of dust
grains by accretion is neglected Within the short timescale considered
here it can be assumed safely
5 We also neglect the destruction of dust grains within the young age con-
sidered see eg Jones Tielens  Hollenbach 1996
6 We assumed a constant SFR for simplicity
Using these assumptions we calculate the chemical evolution
23 SED construction
In this subsection we present the construction of the SED from dust All the de-
tails of the calculations are presented in Takeuchi et al 2003 Takeuchi  Ishii
2004b and Takeuchi et al 2005a
hereafter T03 T04 and T05 respec-
1 Stochastic heating of very small grains
Very small grains cannot establish thermal equilibrium with the ambient
radiation eld This is called stochastic heating To treat the eect we
applied a multidimensional Debye model eg Draine  Li 2001 to the
specic heats of the grain species
2 Emission
The emission from dust is calculated basically according to Draine  Anderson
1985 see T03 Total dust emission is obtained as a superposition of the
emission from each grain species We constructed Qa  of each grain
species from available experimental data via Mie theory
3 Extinction
Self-absorption in the MIR for a very optically thick case is treated by a
thin shell approximation see T04
3 Results
31 Evolution of infrared SED
We rst show the evolution of the IR SED of forming galaxies For these
calculation we adopted the star formation rate SFR  1 M yr1 We adopt
rSF  30 pc and 100 pc These values are relevant when describing dwarf-like
young galaxies The results are presented in Figure 11 We calculated the evo-
lution of the SED in the age range of 1065108 yr After 10725 yr the NMIR
continuum is extinguished by the self-absorption in the case of rSF  30 pc In
contrast the self-absorption is not signicant for rSF  100 pc The SEDs have
their peaks at a wavelength   2030 m which is much shorter than those of
dusty giant galaxies at z  13 detected by SCUBA

4 Discussion
41 Nearby forming dwarf galaxy SBS 0335052
It is still a dicult task to observe galaxies in their very rst phase of the
SF especially to detect their dust emission directly Since a recent observa-
tion of SBS 0335052 by Spitzer has been reported Houck et al 2004 it is
timely to reconsider these textbook objects with new datasets
In addition
understanding the SEDs of these objects will shed light to the physics of inter-
stellar matter and radiation of high-z galaxies also via empirical studies eg
Takeuchi Yoshikawa  Ishii 2003 Takeuchi et al 2005b
SBS 0335052 is a local galaxy  54 Mpc with SFR  17 M yr1
Hunt Vanzi  Thuan 2001 and extremely low metallicity Z  141 Z This
galaxy is known to have an unusual IR SED and strong ux at NMIR It has
a very young starburst age  5 Myr without signicant underlying old stellar
population Vanzi et al 2000 T03 have modeled the SED of SBS 0335052
and reported a good agreement with the available observations at that time
However Houck et al 2004 presented new data of the MIR SED by Spitzer
and reported a deviation of the model by a factor of two or three Their ob-
servation indicated that SBS 0335052 has even more FIR-decient SED than
ever thought Hence it is interesting to examine whether our present model can
reproduce the extreme SED of this galaxy
We show the model SEDs for SBS 0335052 in Figure 2 We have calcu-
lated the SED for rSF  10 20 and 30 pc The SFR is xed to be 17 M yr1
and the age is 1065 yr Details of the observational data are found in T03
and T05 In the FIR regime our model SEDs are consistent with the strong
Dust Emission Model for Very Young Galaxies

SBS 0335052
The model for the SED of a nearby star-forming dwarf galaxy
constraint given by Houck et al 2004 At MIR though we cannot give an ex-
cellent t to the observed data the model SEDs roughly agree with them The
very strong NMIR continuum of SBS 0335052 is well reproduced The dust
mass calculated by our model at this age of SBS 0335052 is 12  103 M
consistent with the observationally estimated value by Dale et al 2001a We
note that the mass estimation is strongly dependent on the assumed dust species
and their emissivities and grain size distribution As we discussed in Section 3
the continuum radiation in the NMIR is dominated by stochastically heated
dust emission which is completely dierent from modied blackbody There-
fore when we try to estimate the dust mass we must take care to determine
the corresponding grain properties ie radiative processes and grain which are
related to the observed SED of galaxies
42 Lyman-break galaxies
Even in LBGs there is clear evidence that they contain non-negligible amount
of dust eg Adelberger  Steidel 2000 A high dust temperature  70 K is
suggested by subsequent studies eg Ouchi et al 1999 Chapman et al 2000
Sawicki 2001 To make a consistent picture of the dust emission from LBGs we
investigate the expected appearance of the LBGs with an improved dust grain
formation of N03
We set the input parameters of the SED model for LBGs as follows The
SFR of LBGs spreads over the range of SFR  1300 Myr1 with a median
of SFR  20 Myr1 eg Erb et al 2003 Thus the basic framework of the
T03 model is also valid for LBGs In this work we consider the moderate case of
SFR  30 Myr1 over the age of 1065108 yr The most important information
to calculate the IR SED is the eective size of the star forming region but it
is the most uncertain quantity see T04 Since the mean half-light radius of
LBGs is estimated to be  16 kpc from HST observations Erb et al 2003 we
use the galaxy radius as the radius of a star-forming region and set rSF  2 kpc
according to T04

We show the observed IRsubmm SEDs of LBGs at z  2 3 and 4 in
Figure 3 For simplicity we only show the SED with the age of 108 yr The
thick black short horizontal lines indicate the 3- detection limits for 8-hour
observation by ALMA Atacama Large Millimeter Array Here we assumed 64
antennas and three wavelength bands 450 850 and 1080 m We also show
the 3- source confusion limit of Herschel at 75 160 250 and 350 m bands by
thick gray horizontal lines These limits are based on the photometric criterion
of Lagache Dole  Puget 2003 see also Takeuchi  Ishii 2004a
As discussed in T04 the detectability of LBGs is not strongly dependent on
their redshifts Detection at 350 m seems impossible for moderate-SFR LBGs
However at longer wavelengths if the age  108 yr and SFR  30 M yr1
LBGs can be detected at a wide range of redshifts in the submm by ALMA
deep survey In the FIR Herschel will detect the dust emission from LBGs at
z  2 but dicult at higher-z
43 Toward higher redshifts
Based on the above discussions we give a brief consideration on the observation
of very high-z galaxies z  5 here In modern hierarchical structure formation
scenarios it would be more reasonable to assume a small subgalactic clump
as a rst forming galaxy Consider a dark halo of mass  109 M then it is
expected to contain a gas with mass  108 M If gas collapses on the free-fall
timescale with an eciency of SF we assume SF  01 we obtain the following
evaluation of the SFR Hirashita  Hunt 2004
SFR  01cid18 SF
01cid19cid18 Mgas
107 Mcid1932cid18 rSF
100 pccid1932
If Mgas  108 M we have SFR  3rSF100 pc32 M yr1 In addition
an extremely high-z galaxy observed by HST has a very compact morphol-
ogy Kneib et al 2004 We also mention that from a theoretical side high-z
galaxies are suggested to be dense and compact compared to nearby galax-
ies eg Hirashita  Ferrara 2002 Thus we consider a dwarf galaxy with
SFR  10 Myr1 as an example and we adopt rSF  30 pc and 100 pc The
age is set to be 107 yr If the age is older they will become easier to detect if
Dust Emission Model for Very Young Galaxies
a constant SFR takes place We show the expected SEDs for such galaxies at
z  5 10 and 20 in Figure 4 As expected it seems almost impossible to detect
such objects by Herschel or ALMA
Figure 4
The expected ux densities of a dwarf star-forming galaxy located
at z  5 10 and 20 Solid lines represent the SEDs for rSF  30 pc and dotted
lines for rSF  100 pc
There is however a hope to observe such a small forming galactic clump
directly gravitational lensing works very well as a natural huge telescope If we
assume a lens magnication factor of 40 such a small galaxy becomes detectable
thin lines in Figure 4 Since the expected SED of such a compact dwarf
galaxy has a strong MIR continuum at their rest frame it can be feasible to
detect at the FIR in the observed frame A cooled FIR space telescope is more
suitable for such observations and this will be a strong scientic motivation
for a future project like SPICA At higher-z they can be detectable by ALMA
survey Even at z  20 they can be detected by a standard 8-hour survey
of ALMA if a lensing takes place For a practical use we must estimate how
frequently such lensing events occur for high-z objects Suppose a cluster of
galaxies at zl  0102 whose dynamical mass Mdyn is 5  1014 M and whose
mass distribution obeys the singular isothermal sphere We denote the strong
lensing cross section ie the area of the region in the source plane for which the
resulting magnication by a cluster is larger than  as   Perrotta et al
2002 presented   as a function of Mdyn for zlens  10 Since   
2 Dls is the angular-diameter distance between the lens and the source
we can convert their result to our condition and obtain  10  30 arcsec2
on the source plane This result is almost independent of the source redshifts
Setting the limiting ux density S  1 Jy and using the number counts of
Hirashita  Ferrara 2002 for galaxies at z  5 we have an expected number
of galaxies suering a strong lensing to be  13 Thus we expect at least a
few strongly lensed IR galaxies to this survey depth
5 Conclusion
With the aid of a new physical model of dust production by SNe developed by
N03 we constructed a model of dust emission from a very young galaxies
Takeuchi
The SED of a local starbursting dwarf galaxy SBS 0335052 was calcu-
lated Our present model SED naturally reproduces the strong NMIR contin-
uum and the lack of cold FIR emission of SBS 0335052 Then we calculated the
evolution of the SED of LBGs Finally we considered the observations of forming
galaxies at z  5 For small forming galaxies with a gas mass Mgas  108 M
it is almost impossible to detect their intrinsic ux by ALMA or Herschel How-
ever the gravitational lensing is found to be a very eective tool to detect such
small star-forming galaxies at z  5
