We revisit in detail the paradox of black hole information loss due to Hawking radiation as tun-
neling We compute the amount of information encoded in correlations among Hawking radiations
for a variety of black holes including the Schwarzchild black hole the Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole the Kerr black hole and the Kerr-Newman black hole The special case of tunneling through
a quantum horizon is also considered Within a phenomenological treatment based on the accepted
emission probability spectrum from a black hole we nd that information is leaked out hidden in
the correlations of Hawking radiation The recovery of this previously unaccounted for information
helps to conserve the total entropy of a system composed of a black hole plus its radiations We
thus conclude irrespective of the microscopic picture for black hole collapsing the associated radi-
ation process Hawking radiation as tunneling is consistent with unitarity as required by quantum
mechanics

INTRODUCTION
Since Hawking radiation was rst discovered 1 2 its inconsistency with quantum theory has been widely debated
Within the scenario developed along the original work of Hawking 2 3 irrespective of the initial state of the
composing matter it always evolves into a thermal state after collapsing into a black hole Such a picture leads to
a paradoxical claim of black hole information loss or the violation of entropy conservation as dierent initial states
pure or mixed evolve into the same nal thermal state This directly violates the principle of unitarity for quantum
dynamics of an isolated system and brings a serious challenge to the foundations of modern physics The lack of a
resolution on this fundamental problem concerning thermodynamics relativity quantum mechanics and cosmology
has attracted considerable attention This problem is now generally known as the paradox of black hole information
loss In the past few decades several methods 38 have been suggested for resolving this paradox none has been
successful In fact each failed attempt for a resolution seems to have made the existence of this paradox more serious
and attracted more interest especially after the possibility that information about infallen matter may hide inside
the correlations between the Hawking radiation and the internal states of a black hole was ruled out It seems either
unitarity or Hawkings semiclassical treatment of radiation must break down 9
In most previous resolutions to the black hole information loss paradox 39 the radiation from a black hole is
considered purely thermal because the background geometry is xed and energy conservation is not enforced during
the radiation process On the other hand some have correctly argued that information could come out if the emitted
radiations were not exactly thermal but instead the radiation spectrum contains a subtle non-thermal correction
10 The semiclassical derivation of Hawking is based on Bogoliubov transformation which always gives pure thermal
radiations Although Hawking later explained the particles of radiation as stemming from vacuum uctuations
tunneling through the horizon of a black hole together with Hartle 11 the original semiclassical treatment did
not have any direct connection with tunneling It is thus important to review the picture of Hawking radiation as
tunneling whereby a pair of particles is spontaneously generated inside the horizon The positive energy particle
tunnels out to the innity while the negative energy one remains in the black hole Alternatively the positive and
negative energy pair is created outside the horizon and the negative energy particle tunnels into the black hole because
its orbit exists only inside the horizon while the positive energy one remains outside and emerges at innity
Recently Parikh and Wilczek 12 developed the method of Hawking radiation as tunneling due to Kraus and
Wilczek 13 14 The ux of particles can be computed directly within their tunneling picture Extensions to many
other situations have since been made 1521 that established a rm basis for the physical explanation of Hawking
radiation as tunneling In their current version 12 22 23 energy conservation is directly enforced and is observed
to play an important role The actual calculation benets from a coordinate system the Painleve coordinate which
unlike the Schwarzchild coordinate is regular at the horizon and is considered to be a particularly suitable and
convenient choice The tunneling process involves particles that can be supplied by considering the geometrical limit
because of the innite blueshift of the outgoing wave-packets near the horizon The barrier is created by the outgoing
particle itself which is ensured by energy conservation Finally the radial null geodesic motion is considered and the
WKB approximation is used to obtain a tunneling probability   exp 2ImI related to the imaginary part of the
action I of the black hole This tunneling probability is related to the change of the entropy of a black hole 12 It
is clearly non-thermal As was pointed out by us in an earlier communication 24 this non-thermal feature implies
the existence of information-carrying correlations among sequentially emitted Hawking radiations
In a recent communication 24 we visited the topic of the black hole information loss paradox starting with the
non-thermal spectrum obtained by Parikh and Wilczek 12 For a typical black hole a Schwarzchild black hole we
discover the existence of correlation among Hawking radiations Upon carefully evaluating the amount of information
carried away in this correlation we nd there is simply no loss of information and that the entropy is conserved for
the total system of the black hole plus its radiations The information coded into the correlations and carried away
by the Hawking radiation is found to balance exactly the amount claimed lost previously 24 Our result thus shows
that tunneling through the horizon is an entropy-conserving process when the entropy associated with the correlations
of emitted particles is included This conclusion is consistent with the principle of unitarity for quantum mechanics
concerning an isolated system
The purpose of this article is to revisit the paradox of black hole information loss along the ideas originally
developed by us in the earlier communication 24 In addition to provide more details for an indepth understanding
and to support our original claim we also extend our previous analysis from the Schwarzschild black holes to the
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes the Kerr black holes and the Kerr-Newman black holes For charged black holes
both tunnelings due to massless neutral particles and massive charged particles will be considered We nd a
sequentially tunneled particles are correlated with each other and b the entropy of the total system composed of a
black hole and its radiations is conserved provided correlations between Hawking radiations are included For massless
neutral particles due to charge conservation the black hole will evolve into the extreme case where the temperature is
zero and the radiation vanishes The total entropy remains conserved during the evolution Before the extreme case
arrives all our analysis remain appropriate and the correlation is found to be capable of taking the information out
from a charged black hole as we suggested In the extreme case the total information remains conserved although
some may have leaked out while others stay in the stable extreme black hole In order to avoid the extreme case
we analyze the tunneling of massive charged particles from the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes and we verify that
the entropy conservation still holds due to energy and charge conservations For rotating black holes and charged
rotating black holes the same conclusion is reached information is carried out by correlations among the non-thermal
radiations the total entropy is conserved Thus the Hawking radiation as tunneling in the above cases must also be
unitary Additionally we discuss Hawking radiation as tunneling through a quantum horizon where a black hole may
evolve into a remnant and not evaporate at all This case does not conict with our claim of entropy conservation
either as information is still carried away by the correlations between outgoing particles
Summarizing our work reported in this paper for an extensive list of black holes we nd the inclusion of the correla-
tions hidden inside non-thermal Hawking radiations presents a resolution to the paradox of black hole information loss
We nd the total entropy is always conserved signicantly extending our earlier claim 24 We thus have provided a
self-consistent and reasonable resolution to the paradox of black hole information loss At the heart of our resolution
is the existence of correlations among emissions of Hawking radiation Independent of the microscopic picture of how
a black hole actually collapses and what its initial and nal states are a non-thermal emission spectrum implies the
existence of correlation As we show below in detail for various types of black holes after carefully counting the total
correlation we nd the total entropy is conserved which implies that no information loss occurs in the process of
Hawking radiation as tunneling
Our paper is organized as follows
In section II we rst review our method of resolving the paradox for a
Schwarzschild black hole in the picture of Hawking radiation as tunneling 24 Subsequently this method is applied
to the analysis of radiation as tunneling for Reissner-Nordstrom black holes Kerr black holes and Kerr-Newman
black holes In the third section we discuss information loss paradox for Hawking radiation as tunneling through a
quantum horizon Section IV ends with conclusions and some remarks To simplify the expressions and calculations
we take the convenient units of k    c  G  1
HAWKING RADIATION AS TUNNELING THROUGH A CLASSICAL HORIZON
We start with a brief review of the method and ideas we introduced earlier for resolving the paradox of black hole
information loss 24 As was pointed out before we nd that correlations exist among Hawking radiations from
a Schwarzchild black hole if its radiation spectrum is non-thermal as required by energy conservation A careful
counting of the total correlations is shown by us to balance exactly the information previously considered lost After
the review we will perform analogous analysis for other situations such as Reissner-Nordstrom black holes Kerr black
holes and Kerr-Newman black holes
Schwarzchild black hole
To properly describe any phenomena involves the crossing of horizon it is helpful to change from the Schwarzchild
coordinates into Painleve coordinates which are not singular at the horizon Finding the radial null geodesic and
computing the imaginary part of the action for the process of s-wave emission across the horizon the tunneling
probability is found to be 12
  expcid208Ecid18M 
2cid19cid21  exp S 
where the second equal sign expresses this result in terms of the change of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy 1 2 27
for the Schwarzchild black hole SBH  A4  4M 2 where A  42M 2 is the surface area of a Schwarzchild black
hole with mass M and radius 2M  It is important to note that this spectrum is non-thermal dierent from the thermal
case of a simple exponential E  exp 8EM  A non-thermal spectrum implies that individual emissions are
correlated because the emission probability for two simultaneous emissions is not the same as the product probabilities
for two independent emissions This point has been outlined in detail in an earlier communication 24 where we show
that such correlations can encode information thus leading to information being carried away by Hawking radiations
When the amount of information carried away by correlation is included the total entropy of the system composed
of the black hole and Hawking radiation is conserved In other words the non-thermal spectrum suggests unitarity
and no information loss in black holes
In statistical theory 25 if the probability for two events arising simultaneously is identically equal to the product
probability of each event arising independently these two events are independent and there exists no correlation
between them Otherwise they are correlated Accepting the spectrum of Eq
1 the probability for the rst
emission at an energy E1 becomes
E1  expcid208E1cid18M 
2 cid19cid21 
After this rst emission the mass of the black hole is reduced to M  E1 due to energy conservation The conditional
probability for a second emission at an energy E2 is therefore given by
The tunneling probability for two emissions with energies E1 and E2 respectively can be computed accordingly as
E2E1  expcid208E2cid18M  E1 
2 cid19cid21 
E1 E2  E1E2E1  expcid208E1  E2cid18M 
E1  E2
cid19cid21 
Interestingly we nd
E1 E2  E1  E2
or the tunneling probability of a particle with an energy E1  E2 is the same as the probability for two emissions of
energies at E1 and E2
To prove the existence of correlation between the two emissions and to properly quantify the amount of correlation
we need to nd the independent probability for each emission Using the theory of probability we nd the marginal
probability 1E1 for the emission at energy E1 is identically the same as E1 26 For the emission at energy E2
we nd the marginal probability 2E2 again takes the same functional form of E2 We nd that
ln E1  E2  ln E1 E2  8E1E2 6 0
which shows that the two tunnelings are not statistically independent and there indeed exist correlations between
Hawking radiations As will become clear later the existence of this correlation is central to the resolution we provide
for the black hole information loss paradox
A fundamental assumption in statistical mechanics concerns the equal probability distribution for every micro-state
which forms the basis of the micro-canonical ensemble approach Given the quantum tunneling of an emitted particle
with an energy E or a Hawking radiation from a black hole with the probability of Eq 1 when the black hole is
exhausted we can nd the entropy of the total system by counting the numbers of its microstates For example one
of the microstates is E1 E2  En andPi Ei  M  Within such a description the order of Ei cannot be changed
the distribution of each Ei is consistent with the tunneling probabilities discussed in the main text The probability
for the specic microstate E1 E2  En to occur is given simply by
PE1E2 En  E1 E2  En
 E1  E2E1    EnE1 E2 En1
Following the steps involved in arriving at Eq 5 it is easy to show
and analogous identities for all subsequent emissions Finally we obtain
E1 E2 E3  E1  E2 E3  E1  E2  E3
PE1E2 En  E1 E2  En
Ej  M   exp4M 2  expSBH
The total number of microstates is therefore given by
PE1E2 En
 expSBH
According to the Boltzmanns denition the entropy of a system is given by S  ln   SBH where the Boltzmanns
constant is taken as unity for simplicity Thus we show after a black hole is exhausted due to Hawking radiation
the entropy carried away in the emitted particles Hawking radiations is precisely equal to the entropy SBH in the
original black hole 1 2 27
This result is in direct contradiction with the black hole information loss paradox A lot of previous investigations
3 2830 support the claim that information can be lost in a black hole Thus the total entropy of a black hole
increases during Hawking radiation 31 32 The analysis we provide here however shows otherwise Based on
a straightforward calculation using statistical theory we nd the total entropy is conserved This shows the time
evolution of a black hole is unitary In particular the Hawking radiation remains governed by conservations laws we
are accustomed to
Two signicant points distinguish our investigation from most existing theories First we start with the assumption
of the non-thermal spectrum for Hawking radiation as derived by Parikh and Wilczek 12 Second we discover the
existence of information-carrying correlations among dierent Hawking emissions assuming the nonthermal spectrum
24 The physics of both points lie at the fundamental law of energy conservation In contrast to the earlier thermal
spectrum of Hawking Parikh and Wilczek enforced energy conservation when they computed the emission spectrum
based on Hawking radiation as tunneling The arising of correlations between dierent emissions then becomes easy
to understand as we have shown earlier after the emission of a Hawking radiation the mass of the remaining black
hole decreases which subsequently aects the next emission thus establishes correlations between dierent emissions
Assuming the particular form of the non-thermal spectrum by Parikh and Wilczek the correlations among dierent
emissions of Hawking radiation can be thoroughly studied
We next provide a careful quantication for the amount of the correlation between dierent Hawking emissions in
terms of the amount of information it can encode In addition to establishing an alternative proof the discussion in
the next few paragraphs provides an insightful understanding of our claim that Hawking radiation is a unitary process
and the entropy for a black hole plus its Hawking radiation is conserved More vividly our analysis below shows that
Hawking radiations can be viewed as messengers In this way information is leaked out through correlated tunneling
processes that will be shown clearly when we compare the amount of correlation with the mutual information between
the two emissions
Because of the existence of correlation we shall be very careful when considering emissions of particles with energies
E1 and E2 one after another because E2E1 is the conditional probability for an emission at energy E2 given the
occurrence of an emission with energy E1 More generally we use Ei to denote the energy for the ith emission Given
the total energy for all previous emissionsP Ei  E1  E2   Ef 1 the tunneling probability for a next emission
2 cid17i From EfE1 E2  Ef 1
we can compute the entropy taken away by a tunneling particle with energy Ef after the black hole has emitted a
of energy Ef becomes EfE1 E2  Ef 1  exph8Efcid16M P Ei  Ef
total energy P Ei which is given by
In quantum information theory S EfE1 E2  Ef 1 denotes conditional entropy and is used to quantify the
remaining entropy of an emission with energy Ef given that information for all previously emitted particles with
a total energy P Ei are known In quantitative terms we nd SEfE1 E2  Ef 1 is equal to the decrease of
entropy for a black hole with a mass M P Ei upon an emission of Ef  This also agrees with the general second law
of black hole thermodynamics 33 34 The tunneling particles must carry entropy with themselves because the total
entropy of a black hole and its radiations can never decrease In what follows we will show that by using entropy we
can measure the amount of information hidden in the correlation 6
S Ef E1 E2  Ef 1   ln  Ef E1 E2  Ef 1 
The mutual information 35 between two subsystems A and B in a composite bi-partite system is dened as
SA  B  SA  SB  SA B  SA  SAB
where SAB is nothing but the conditional entropy This mutual information can be used to measure the total
amount of correlations between any bi-partite systems When applied to the emission of two particles with energies
E1 and E2 their mutual information becomes
SE2  E1  SE2  SE2E1   ln E2  ln E2E1
For a classical horizon using Eqs 2 and 3 we nd previously SE2  E1  8E1E2 This shows that the
correlation between emissions of Hawking radiation can carry information ie the above Eq 13 arms that the
amount of correlation quantity in Eq 6 is precisely equal to the mutual information between emissions for a classical
horizon Additionally this justies the reexamination of the entropy 11 by quantum information theory
We now compute the entropy of all tunneled particles The entropy for the rst tunneled particle with energy E1
from a black hole of mass M  is given by
SE1   ln E1  8E1cid18M 
2 cid19 
The entropy for the second tunneling particle with energy E2 after the emission of a particle with energy E1 becomes
SE2E1   ln E2E1  8E2cid18M  E1 
2 cid19 
analogous to the formula 14 except for the reduced mass of the black hole to M  E1 due to the rst emission from
energy conservation The total entropy from the two emitted particles E1 and E2 is
SE1 E2  SE1  SE2E1
ie rightfully including the contribution from their correlation This result can be repeated After the tunneling of
particles with energies E1 and E2 the mass of the black hole becomes M  E1  E2 and it proceeds to emit a third
particle with energy E3 due to tunneling The corresponding tunneling entropy is SE3E1 E2   lnE3E1 E2
which gives the total entropy for the three emissions respectively at energies E1 E2 and E3
For all emissions which eventually exhausts the black hole we nd
SE1 E2 E3  SE1  SE2E1  SE3E1 E2
SE1 E2  En 
SEiE1 E2  Ei1
where M  Pn
i1 Ei is the initial energy of the black hole due to energy conservation The generalized term
SE1 E2  En denotes the joint entropy of all emitted radiations and SEiE1 E2  Ei1 is the respective
conditional entropy for the ith emission with energy Ei after the emissions of a total of i  1 particles We recall that
Eq 18 satises the chain rule for conditional entropies in information theory Please see Ref 35 chapter 11 When
the black hole is exhausted all of its entropy is carried away by Hawking radiations By a detailed calculation from
Eq 18 we previously show that the total entropy of all Hawking radiations equals to SE1 E2  En  4M 2
which is exactly the same as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a black hole This equation shows that the entropy of
a black hole is indeed taken out by Hawking radiations and the total entropy of all emitted radiations and the black
hole is unchanged during the black hole radiation process According to quantum mechanics only unitary processes
conserve the entropy for a closed system Thus we conclude that irrespective of the microscopic picture for a black
hole the fact that the total entropy remains conserved during Hawking radiation implies that the black hole radiation
as tunneling is unitary in principle This provides a self-consistent and reasonable resolution to the long standing
paradox of black hole information loss
Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
The method of null geodesic can also be applied to treat Hawking radiation from a charged black hole The
12 The counterpart to the
emission due to tunneling of non-charged neutral particles was considered in Ref
Painleve coordinate for the charged Reissner-Nordstrom coordinate is
ds2  cid181 
r2 cid19 dt2  2r 2M
r2 dtdr  dr2  r2d2
Following the standard procedure the imaginary part of the action for an outgoing massless neutral particle can
be computed and the resulting tunneling probability is
  exph4cid162EM  E2  M  EpM  E2  Q2  MpM 2  Q2cid17i
 exp S 
where S  M pM 2  Q2 2 is the entropy The corresponding temperature for a charged black hole is T 
MM 2
Q2 2  that allows us to compare the tunneling probability 20 with the Boltzmann factor for emission
  expE   1T  As before we nd this spectrum is non-thermal and the relationship E1  E2 
E1 E2 remains true Using the same argument as before for computing the information or entropy carried by the
correlations of two emitted particles for a Schwarzchild black hole outlined in the previous subsection we nd
ln E1  E2  ln E1 E2 6 0
Again we nd the existence of correlations among Hawking radiations because the spectrum for emission from a
charged black hole is also non-thermal In the process of two particles tunneling with respective energies E1 and E2
we nd the entropy form
SE1   ln E1  4cid162E1M  E2
SE2E1   ln E2E1
1  M  E1pM  E12  Q2  MpM 2  Q2cid17 
 4cid162E2 M  E1  E2
2  M  E1  E2pM  E1  E22  Q2  MpM 2  Q2cid17 
Not surprisingly they satisfy the denition of conditional entropy SE1 E2   ln E1  E2  SE1  SE2E1
After a detailed calculation again we nd that the amount of correlation is exactly equal to the mutual information
described in Eq 13 and this shows that the correlation can carry information from a Reissner-Nordstrom black
hole and any single step of the emission must be entropy preserving We can count the total entropy carried away by
all outgoing particles and nd

SEiE1 E2  Ei1  SE
i1 Ei is the total energy of the black hole radiation
where E Pn
A subtle dierence arises from the previously considered Schwarzchild black hole In the present case the mass of
a black hole can never decrease to zero yet the tunneling probability must remain a real value thus M 2  Q2  0
is to be enforced Because the tunneled particles are taken as neutrals the extreme case is reached when M 2  Q2
The temperature is T  0 in the extreme case so Hawking radiation will vanish and the black hole is stablized This
is consistent with cosmic censorship For the information loss paradox we seek to resolve it is important to ask is
entropy still conserved in the extreme case The key point to a legitimate answer depends on how to properly describe
the entropy of an extreme black hole According to the denition of Bekenstein-Hawking the entropy of an extreme
black hole is proportional to its surface area although its temperature is zero Thus we can conclude that even in
the extreme case the entropy remains conserved Although the entropy or the information  cannot be taken out
completely the residual information remains inside the extreme black hole This is reasonable because the extreme
limit can be viewed as the ground state of a charged black hole which has a high degeneracy  eSe with Se  M 2
A microscopic picture of tunneling by charged particles is more appropriate in order to avoid the extreme case
Fortunately the tunneling probability of charged massive particles for a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole has been
obtained in Ref 15 With outgoing particles capable of carrying away charges from a charged black hole its semi-
classical trajectories have to be modied due to electromagnetic forces In the treatment of Ref 15 the 4-dimensional
electromagnetic potential A  At 0 0 0 where At  Qr is introduced in the quasi-Painleve coordinates 19 and
the electromagnetic interaction 14FF  which can be described by the potential A also has to be considered
in calculating the action Taking into account the modications to the equation of motion due to the change of charge
and including the contribution from the electromagnetic interaction the tunneling probability is found to be 15
  expcid18M  E qM  E2  Q  q2cid192

where S  SM  E Q  q  SM Q is the dierence of entropies for a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole before
and after the emission and q is the charge that is carried away by the particle with energy E Comparing with the
Boltzmann factor we nd clearly this remains a non-thermal spectrum Using our method outlined before we conclude
there exists information-carrying correlations among emitted particles Analogously after a detailed calculation we
nd that the total entropy carried away by the outgoing particles plus that of the accompanying black hole remains
conserved which is now due to both energy and charge conservations Thus we nd once again no information is lost
in the Hawking radiation as tunneling for a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole
Kerr black hole
For rotating black holes 16 a complication arises from the frame-dragging eect of the coordinate system in the
stationary rotating spacetime The matter eld in the ergosphere near the horizon must be dragged by the gravitational
eld with an azimuthal angular velocity A proper physical picture thus must be capable of describing such eects
in the dragged coordinate system Adopting the quasi-Painleve time transformation and the dragging coordinate
transformation for the Doran form of the Kerr coordinates 37 the so-called dragged Painleve-Kerr coordinates can
be expressed as
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
dt2 
r2  a2 dr2  2 p2M rr2  a2
r2  a22  a2 sin2 
dtdr   d2
where a is the angular momentum of a unit mass   r2  a2 cos2  and   r2  a2  2M r In this spacetime the
event horizon and the innite red-shifted surface coincides with each other so that the WKB approximation can be
used to calculate the imaginary part of the action The tunneling probability for a rotating black hole is then found
to be 16
  expcid202cid18M 2  M  E2  MpM 2  a2  M  EqM  E2  a2cid19cid21
 exp S 
where S  SM  E Q  q  SM Q is the dierence of the entropies for a Kerr black hole before and after the
emission of a particle with energy E This spectrum 25 is once again non-thermal and the interesting property
E1  E2  E1 E2 remains true The total amount of correlations hidden inside Hawking radiations can again
be computed analogously and we nd
For tunneling of two particles with respective energies E1 and E2 we nd the entropies
ln E1  E2  ln E1 E2 6 0
SE1   ln E1  2cid18M 2  M  E12  MpM 2  a2  M  E1qM  E12  a2cid19

2cid20M  E1  E2qM  E1  E22  a2cid21 
Clearly they also satisfy the denition of conditional entropy SE1 E2   ln E1  E2  SE1  SE2E1 A
detailed calculation again reveals that the amount of correlation in this case is exactly equal to the mutual information
described in Eq 13 We can count the total entropy carried away by the outgoing particles in the same manner
and nd
SE1 E2  En 
SEiE1 E2  Ei1  SE
where E Pn
i1 Ei is the total energy of the Hawking radiations
After a detailed calculation we again nd that no information is lost as the tunneling process is an entropy
conserving one However since the black hole is rotating angular momentum conservation must be considered In
the tunneling process considered here we do not see how the angular momentum is carried away An obvious reason
is that the total angular momentum of a black hole is absent in the coordinates and instead the angular momentum
of a unit mass is used The outgoing particles clearly carry away the angular momentum and this can be seen in
the calculation for the imaginary part of the action and the tunneling probability We conclude that the entropy
conservation is due to both energy conservation and angular momentum conservation Once again it is the existence
of information-carrying correlations due to energy conservation that resolves the information loss paradox for Hawking
radiation as tunneling for a Kerr black hole
We note that due to the angular momentum conservation of a unit mass in the tunneling process the extreme case
a2  M 2 is guaranteed to appear and the radiation will then stop However this does not contradict our conclusion
because in the extreme limit all tunneling processes vanish and the residual entropy will remain inside the extreme
black hole which is consistent with entropy conservation and unitarity
Kerr-Newman black hole
If we were to consider uncharged massless particles tunneling from a charged rotating black hole the calculation
would completely parallel that for a Kerr black hole Instead we consider tunneling of charged massive particles for a
Kerr-Newman black hole 16 17 Like for a Kerr black hole one has to treat the frame-dragging eect using dragging
coordinate transformation and then the event horizon becomes consistent with the innite red-shifted surface which
allows for the WKB approximation to be used On the other hand because the particles are now charged the
contribution to the action from the electromagnetic interaction has to be included
Performing the quasi-Painleve time transformation and the dragging coordinate transformation for the Boyer-
Lindquist form of the Kerr-Newman coordinates 38 the dragged Painleve-Kerr-Newman coordinates are obtained
as following

Calculating the imaginary part of the action in the usual manner including the contribution from electromagnetic
interaction the tunneling probability of charged massive particles for a Kerr-Newman black hole 16 17 is found to

where S  SM  E Q  q  SM Q is the dierence of entropies for a Kerr-Newman black hole before and after
the emission of a particle with energy E and charge q Not surprisingly the spectrum is again a non-thermal one and
an analogous relationship E1  E2 q1  q2  E1 q1 E2 q2 from which we can arm the existence of correlation
between two radiated emissions as
ln E1  E2 q1  q2  ln E1 q1 E2 q2 6 0
Like other types of black holes we considered previously we nd that there exists correlation in Hawking radiation
from a charged rotating black hole For two emissions with respective energies E1 and E2 and charges q1 and q2
we nd

because of energy conservation charge conservation and angular momentum conservation being rightfully enforced
for the process We thus nd no information is lost in Hawking radiation as tunneling for a Kerr-Newman black hole
Like the situation for the Kerr black hole the angular momentum of a unit mass remains a constant or conserved in
the tunneling process the extreme case a2  M 2 thus must appear in the end of tunneling process However this
doesnt contradict our conclusions because the Hawking radiation terminates in the extreme case and the residual
entropy will remain a constant inside the black hole
Before concluding this section we will explain why information can be carried away from a black hole by Hawking
radiation as tunneling The most important reason is that the emission process is probabilistic not a deterministic
one For each tunneling emission from a black hole we only know a radiation may occur with a probability E
nothing else In other words the uncertainty of the event for a radiation with energy E or the potential information
we can gain from the event is SE   ln E
When a radiation with energy E1 is received the potential information we can gain is SE1   ln E1 After
already receiving the emission at energy E1 when we receive the next radiation with energy E2 the potential
information we can gain is SE2E1   ln E2E1 Step by step we can track each subsequent emission all of
the n emissions until the black hole stops radiating Of course we have to assume that the observer is rightfully
equipped to detect all radiations
In the end the information gained by the observer is SE1 E2  En where
for a Schwarzchild black hole SE1 E2  En is nothing but the initial entropy of the black hole For a Reissner-
Nordstrom black hole a Kerr black hole and a Kerr-Newman black hole the entropy of their extreme black holes
is Se  SBH  SE1 E2  En where SBH is their respective initial entropy However given all radiations are
received and detected by an observer heshe cannot reconstruct the initial state from which the matter collapses into
a black hole A legitimate reconstruction may need more knowledge concerning the dynamic description for black
hole radiation which seems only possible with a complete theory for quantum gravity
In concluding this section we use statistical method and quantum information theory to show that no information
is lost in Hawking radiation as tunneling This result constrains the black hole evaporation as tunneling to be a
unitary process Our conclusion is based on a single but an important observation that a non-thermal Hawking
radiation spectrum implies the existence of information-carrying correlation among emitted particles Upon counting
the total entropy the portion due to correlation is found to exactly balance the part previously perceived as lost
Within our suggested resolution we nd that energy conservation or the self-gravitation eect plays a crucial role
For some black holes such as charged rotating and charged-rotating black holes other conservation laws such as
charge conservation and angular momentum conservation also aect the tunneling rate and are important for the
entropy conservation This implies that in further studies about the black hole information loss paradox quantum
gravity theory should be considered within the framework of energy charge and angular momentum conservations
HAWKING RADIATION AS TUNNELING THROUGH A QUANTUM HORIZON
Hawking radiation as tunneling through a quantum horizon has been considered before 18 and the tunneling
probability is already given in a general spherically symmetric system in the ADM form 14 by referencing to the
rst law of black hole thermodynamics dM

2cid19cid21  exp S 
where S  A
4   ln A is the entropy derived by directly counting the number of micro-states with string theory and
loop quantum gravity 18 The coecient  is negative in loop quantum gravity 39 Its sign remains uncertain in
string theory depending on the number of eld species in the low energy approximation 40 When   0 and the
tunneling energy approaches the mass of the black hole the tunneling probability   0 A more interesting case
occurs when   0 the black hole will not radiate away all of its mass The tunneling will halt at a critical value of
the black hole mass giving rise to a situation similar to a black hole remnant as described in Ref 41 Recently some
quantum properties of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and its universal sub-leading corrections have been discussed
4244
For Hawking radiation as tunneling through a quantum horizon as described by the Eq 36 we can use the same
statistical method as described by Eqs 2 and 4 to probe and measure correlation We nd as before the interesting
relationship E1  E2  E1 E2 remains true The amount of correlation is evaluated to be
ln E1  E2  ln E1 E2  8E1E2  2 ln
M M  E1  E2
M  E1M  E2 6 0
Once again correlations are found to exist due to the non-thermal nature of the spectrum Eq 36 despite being
corrected by quantum gravity eect Unlike the result of Eq 6 an additional term appears as the second term
before the last inequality sign in Eq 37 On careful examination we conjecture that this correction may carry
information about eects of quantum gravity or black hole area quantization 4244
The process of two emissions can be considered as in the situation when the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is used
and we nd

  2 ln1 
SE2E1   ln E2E1  8E2M  E1

M  E1cid19 
Again this form is consistent with the denition of conditional entropy SE1 E2  SE1  SE2E1 Repeating
the steps until the black hole is exhausted by emissions we nd
SEiE1 E2  Ei1
i1 Ei is the total energy of the black hole radiation
where E Pn
For   0 we nd E  0 when E  M  but S M  E   This causes diculty explaining the origin of an
exponentially growing entropy when the black hole vanishes However qualitatively this actually can be understood
within the picture of Hawking radiation from a black hole In the limit of M   0 the tunneling energy approaches
the mass of the black hole and the tunneling becomes slower and slower while the time to exhaust a black-hole
approaches innite This innity also can be obtained from other methods by using the Stefan-Boltzmann law as in
Ref 45
cles will be emitted From Eq
For   0 it is known 41 that when the mass of a black hole approaches the critical mass Mc no parti-
SEiE1 E2  Ei1 or SM  
41 the mass Mc is called the zero point energy of a black hole
40 we then obtain SM   SMc  Pi
SEiE1 E2  Ei1  SMc
In Ref
that is similar to a black hole remnant because it does not depend on the initial black hole mass We have shown
that even with such a remnant the total entropy remains conserved when information carried away by correlations
are correctly included Thus the unitarity remains true when the classical horizon is replaced by a quantum one for
Hawking radiation
CONCLUSIONS
In this work we have signicantly expanded our self-consistent theory for the resolution of the paradox for black
hole information loss In the picture of Hawking radiation as tunneling 12 we have earlier pointed out the existence
of correlations among radiations whenever the emission spectrum or the tunneling probabilities are non-thermal
While phenomenological this resolution rst proposed by us in an earlier communication 24 is rmly supported by
statistical theory Although we reply on the results from a semi-classical treatment of Hawking radiation as tunneling
there is no room for comprise regarding our main conclusion for the existence of correlation as we have shown here
for the various type of black holes Whenever the Hawking radiation spectrum takes a non-thermal form correlations
must exist among radiated particles irrespective of the nature for these emissions being charged or neutral massive
or massless particles etc
By comparing the amount of information that can be encoded into this correlation with the mutual information
of quantum information theory as we did previously 24 we have shown in this work for an extensive list of black
holes that the amount of information is always precisely equal to the mutual information Due to the tunneling or
the emission the mass of a black hole decreases that lowers the entropy of a black hole According to the general
second law of thermodynamics the total entropy of the system consisting of a black hole and its radiation can never
decrease Thus the tunneled particles as Hawking radiation must carry away entropy Upon careful evaluation of
the total entropy for radiated particles including the contribution of the correlation we nd that the total entropy
is conserved in the tunneling process which supports the statement of unitary evolution for Hawking radiation as
tunneling 24 In addition to the standard Schwarzschild black holes we considered earlier 24 the list of black holes
we consider in this article includes Reissner-Nordstrom black holes Kerr black holes and Kerr-Newman black holes
Surprisingly or perhaps not so surprisingly even when considering the corrections due to quantum gravity 46 in
the tunneling process our conclusions remain true there exists correlation among Hawking radiations if the emission
spectrum is non-thermal the total amount of correlation exactly balances the mutual entropy the Hawking radiation
is an entropy conserving process Within the framework of our result we shall view the tunneling particles and the
correlations as messengers capable of carrying away entropy and information to assure that the entropy for the total
system is conserved
Based on our current understanding we feel our conclusions are signicant at least in two aspects The rst concerns
black hole thermodynamics It has been shown before that the tunneling process we discuss satises the rst law
of black hole thermodynamics irrespective of whether the horizon is classical 47 or quantum 48 No conclusive
consensus exist concerning the second law of black hole thermodynamics Before our work it was not known how
entropy changes and our conclusion that Hawking radiation is an entropy conserving process is thus quite exciting
This opens the door to reversibility and unitary dynamics for a black hole in principle We note that reversibility
is consistent with microscopic unitarity The second aspect concerns the information loss paradox There are two
important results here 1 we have shown within the picture of Hawking radiation as tunneling that the entropy
growth can be exactly balanced which provides a necessary condition to resolve the Hawking paradox of black hole
information loss Any legitimate attempt to resolve this paradox must nd a solution to balance the entropy growth
during the black hole evaporation process if individual emissions are considered independent If entropy is indeed
growing in a process this process cannot be unitary 2 We have shown that there exists correlation among Hawking
radiations from a black hole Using quantum information theory the mutual information between two quantum
subsystems or two emitted particles as considered in this study we show that the amount of correlation among the
black hole radiations can encode exactly the same amount of information and carry them away upon emission which
certainly represents a plausible resolution to release the information locked in a black hole Any resolution to the
information loss paradox of a black hole requires such a suitable mechanism to release the information locked in a
black hole Fortunately we have uncovered such a mechanism inherent in the correlations of emitted particles
In summary we have shown that entropy is conserved in Hawking radiation This resolves the paradox of black
hole information loss The amount of information that formerly was perceived to be lost is found to be encoded and
carried away by Hawking radiations This lends strong support to the belief that Hawking radiation as tunneling is
unitary in principle based on the work we presented in this article
As a nal remark we note that for some cases we study a black hole does not radiate away all of its mass and
leaves behind a remnant in the end or forms an extreme black hole Even for these special cases our study shows
that our conclusions remain valid Information is still leaked out so long as a black hole starts to radiate Based on
our theoretical treatment or the resolution we present for the paradox of black hole information loss due to Hawking
radiation we nd that energy conservation or self-gravitation eect should be enforced when quantum theory is unied
with gravity Conservation laws are the most fundamental elements in a consistent theory for quantum gravity
