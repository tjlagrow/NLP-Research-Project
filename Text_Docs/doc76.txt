ABSTRACT
Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies NLS1s are intriguing due to their continuum as
well as emission line properties The observed peculiar properties of the NLS1s are
believed to be due to accretion rate close to Eddington limit As a consequence for
a given luminosity NLS1s have smaller black hole BH masses compared to normal
Seyfert galaxies Here we argue that NLS1s might be Seyfert galaxies in their early
stage of evolution and as such may be low redshift low luminosity analogues of high
redshift quasars We propose that NLS1s may reside in rejuvenated gas rich galaxies
We also argue in favor of collisional ionization for production of FeII in active galactic
nuclei AGN
Key words galaxies active - quasars general - galaxies Seyfert - galaxies evolution
INTRODUCTION
Years after their discovery Osterbrock  Pogge 1985 the
NLS1s have attracted attention of the AGN community
at least partly due to their peculiar X-ray properties The
NLS1s are Seyfert 1 galaxies with relatively narrow widths
of permitted optical emission lines full width at half maxi-
mum FWHM 
 2000 kms strong optical FeIIH ratio
weak OIII emission and as such were found to occupy one
extreme end of the Boroson  Green 1992 eigenvector 1
An extremely strong anti-correlation was found between soft
X-ray spectral slopes and H FWHM in Seyfert 1s Boller
Brandt  Fink 1996 and quasars Laor et al 1997 mean-
ing that a relation between the lines and continuum exists
Eigenvector 1 was later found Brandt  Boller 1998 to
correlate strongly with the soft X-ray power-law slope Since
the soft X-rays are formed in the vicinity of the central black
hole eigenvector 1 has probably a more fundamental phys-
ical meaning
NLS1s as a class show peculiar continuum properties
as well They have very steep soft X-ray slopes   
213 F    while for normal Sy1s    134003
and sometimes show rapid large amplitude variability The
hard X-ray spectra are steep as well Brandt Mathur 
Elvis 1997 In the optical and UV range most of NLS1s
show a weak big blue bump BBB which is most likely
due to the shift of the BBB sometimes out of the opti-
calUV range towards higher energies The high energy tail
of the BBB is apparent as the unusually strong and steep
soft X-ray excess NLS1s also show strong IR emission and
some high polarization

Many continuum properties of the NLS1s can be ex-
plained in terms of high accretion rate compared to the Ed-
dington limit  m  M MEdd and so a small black hole
BH mass for a given luminosity The high accretion rate
explanation for the X-ray properties of NLS1s was rst pro-
posed by Pounds Done  Osborne 1995 in analogy with
Galactic BH candidates whose soft X-ray spectra become
steep in their high state The narrow widths of the emis-
sion lines can be explained if the Broad Line Region BLR
scales as L12 and emission line clouds are virialized around
the small mass BH Laor et al 1997 As an alternative
Wandel 1997 has argued that the continuum with steeper
X-ray slope has stronger ionizing power and hence the BLR
is formed at a larger distance from the center The result-
ing smaller velocity dispersion produces narrower lines In
general there is a reasonable consensus that large m is the
cause of the observed peculiar properties of NLS1 an alter-
native being a pole-on view A natural question to ask as a
next step would be what determines the accretion rate in
an active galaxy Is it the age
2 ARE NLS1S THE ACTIVE GALAXIES IN
THE MAKING
Here we present a number of arguments in support of our
proposal that NLS1 might be Active Galaxies in early phase
of their evolution
1 Smaller BH mass As per the well known correlation
of Magorrian et al
1998 smaller mass BHs reside in
galaxies with smaller spheroids Since NLS1s have rela-
Smita Mathur
tively smaller mass BHs compared to normal Seyferts the
spheroids of their host galaxies might be smaller see also
Laor 1998 Indeed in the compilation of Wandel 1999
the NLS1 galaxy NGC4051 has the smallest black hole to
bulge mass ratio An accreting BH would also grow in mass
with time the Salpeter time scale of growth is determined
by ts  3  107LEddLB 01 yr where 01 is the radiative
eciency in the units of 01 see Fabian 1999 Since NLS1
accrete at close to Eddington limit their BHs would grow
faster So smaller BHs in NLS1s are likely to be younger as
2 Super-solar gas phase metallicities There are a cou-
ple of lines of evidence to suggest that NLS1s may have
super-solar gas phase metallicities One comes from the
study of high ionization emission lines Wills et al 1999
found that the strength of NV 1240 emission line was
systematically larger while the strength of the CIV 1549
was systematically smaller in AGN with narrow emission
lines The NVCIV ratio serves as an abundance indica-
tor as shown by Hamann  Ferland 1993 So the NLS1s
may have large nitrogen abundance Absorption lines being
insensitive to density serve as better indicators of metal-
licities In the narrow line AGN PG1404226 Ulrich et
al 1999 found that while the strengths of Ly and CIV
absorption lines were in reasonable agreement with those
expected from the ionized X-ray absorber See Mathur 1997
for XUV absorber models the NV absorption line was sig-
nicantly stronger This observation again can be under-
stood in terms of high nitrogen abundance in this narrow
line AGN Mathur  Komossa 2000
Large nitrogen abundance is obtained when overall
metallicities are high with NH  ZZ2 where Z is
the solar abundance Nitrogen is preferentially enhanced
because of secondary CNO nucleosynthesis see Hamann
 Ferland 1999 HF99 for details on AGN metallicities
Thus the observations of emission as well as absorption
lines in NLS1s imply super-solar gas phase metallicities The
strength of the uorescent Fe-K alpha line in some NLS1s is
also indicative of super-solar abundance Fabian 1999
Such metal enrichment is possible when the initial mass
function of star formation is at favorable for high mass
star formation and the evolution is fast Such a star forma-
tion scenario is likely to be present in deep potential wells
like galactic nuclei and protogalactic clumps HF99 More-
over high metallicities are achieved while consuming less gas
HF99 The NLS1s may then represent that early phase in
galactic evolution when rapid star formation is taking place
in the nucleus
3 IR brightness Many NLS1s are observed to be bright
in the infra-red Moran Halpern  Helfand 1996 Young
star forming galaxies are also bright IR sources It is possible
that a part of the nuclear IR ux is from a nuclear star burst
4 Analogy with high redshift quasars In 3 we argue
that NLS1s are analogous to very high redshift quasars High
redshift z4 quasars are believed to quasars in the early
phase of evolution compared to the z  1 quasars By anal-
ogy NLS1s may as well be in the early evolutionary phase
compared to the normal Seyfert galaxies
3 ARE NLS1S LOW REDSHIFT ANALOGUES
OF HIGH REDSHIFT QUASARS
That the AGN phenomenon was so much stronger at z
23 than today has long elicited the suspicion that there is
a connection between the youth of a galaxy and the likeli-
hood that an AGN forms inside it The question then nat-
urally arises what are the local counterparts to the young
galaxies in early universe in which local AGN may live
see eg Krolik 1999 A standard answer to this question
is Starburst galaxies Heckman 1999 has argued that
starburst galaxies are the low redshift analogues of Lyman
break galaxies at high redshift Similarly we ask what are
the low redshift analogues of high redshift z 
 4 quasars
We propose that they might be NLS1s
It is interesting to note the similarity of the properties
of NLS1s with high redshift z 
 4 quasars
1 Hamann  Ferland 1993 found high metallicities
in high redshift quasars Z 
 4 Large metallici-
ties in NLS1s may make them low redshift low luminosity
analogues of high redshift quasars
 Z at z 
2 NLS1s and BALQSOs Similarities between the ob-
served properties of low ionization Broad Absorption Lines
Quasars BALQSOs and NLS1s have been reported in the
literature eg Lawrence et al 1997 Leighly et al 1997
Both these classes show strong FeII4570 and AlIII1857
and weak CIV1549 and OIII5007 emission lines Their
continua are red in the optical and strong in the IR Evi-
dence of relativistic outow is also reported in three NLS1s
Leighly et al 1997 If these two classes are indeed related
Brandt 1999 then NLS1 at least those those with some
evidence of outow might be low redshift low luminosity
cousins of BALQSOs BALQSOs are tentatively identied
with that phase in quasar evolution when the matter around
the nuclear BH is being blown away and a quasar emerges
see eg Fabian 1999 NLS1s may then represent a similar
early evolutionary phase at low redshift
3 Optical spectra of a sample of z 
 4 quasars revealed
that their emission lines are typically narrower than the low
redshift quasars FWHM 
 2000 kms Shields  Hamann
1997 The normal explanation of this observation is that
these are type 2 quasars where the broad emission lines are
obscured from our line of sight Alternatively these high z
quasars might be true narrow broad line objects
4 We note here another interesting connection with
high redshift As discussed in 1 NLS1s have strong FeII
emission lines Quasars Q0014813 and Q0636680 at red-
shifts z3398 and z3195 respectively were observed to
have very strong FeII emission Elston Thompson  Hill
1994 Are they also highly accreting objects at early evo-
lutionary phase Note also the narrow UV emission lines
 2150 km s1 in the ultra strong UV FeII emit-
FWHM 
ter Q2226-3905 Graham Clowes  Campusano 1996
All these similarities point towards NLS1s being low
redshift low luminosity analogues of high redshift quasars
 We note that Grupe 1996 has also argued that the age since
an AGN was born might be the underlying reason for some NLS1-
type correlations he has studied

4 DO NLS1S RESIDE IN REJUVENATED
GALAXIES
In the previous section we have argued that NLS1s may rep-
resent an early phase in AGN evolution Whether they reside
in young galaxies is a separate question and a step further
That young galaxies are gas rich is helpful they would have
the large reservoir of gas necessary to sustain the close to
Eddington rate accretion in NLS1s But do we have any ev-
idence that they indeed reside in young galaxies There is
no published systematic study of the properties of the host
galaxies of NLS1s However some of the NLS1s are origi-
nally from Zwicky eg I Zw 1 and Markarian eg Mrk
766 sample of galaxies implying that they are blue While
the blue color might be due to big blue bumps in the active
nuclei as in normal Seyfert galaxies NLS1s have weak blue
bumps 1 and so the blue colors might be a result of ac-
tively star forming galaxies Some NLS1s are IRAS galaxies
eg IRAS 133492438 infra-red bright and star form-
ing Using the catalogs of galaxies RC3 de Vaucouleurs et
al 1991 and UGC Nilson 1973 we looked into the mor-
phology of a small sample of NLS1s with X-ray absorption
features and found information on seven of them Three were
found to be compact I Zw 1 Mrk 507 and Mrk 1298 two
with signatures of inner ring NGC 4051 and Ark 564 and
three with nuclear bars NGC 4051 Mrk 776 and Ark 564
These are signatures of recent activity most likely due to
galaxy- galaxy interactions or mergers In this scenario the
galaxies are newly formed or rejuvanated
That NLS1s reside in young galaxies is also consistent
with the hypothesis that the formation and evolution of
galaxies and their active nuclei is intimately related Rees
1997 Fabian 1999 Granato et al 1999 Haehnett  Ko-
mann 1999 In this scenario the process of formation of a
massive BH and the active nucleus is the very process of
galaxy formation The active nucleus and the galaxy evolve
together with BH accreting matter and the galaxy making
stars At one stage the winds from the active nucleus blow
away the matter surrounding it and a quasar emerges This
is not only the end of active evolution of the quasar but
that of the galaxy as well which is evacuated of its inter-
stellar medium The quasar then shines as long as there is
fuel in the accretion disk Fabian 1999 In this scenario
high redshift quasars represent early stage of galaxy evolu-
tion BALQSOs at z 2 represent the stage when the gas is
being blown away and z 1 quasars would be the passively
evolving population Massive ellipticals found today might
be the dead remnants of what were once quasars
The quasar phenomenon may thus be a result of galaxy
formation due to primordial density uctuations At low red-
shift when new galaxies are formed due to interactions or
mergers similar evolution may take place As argued above
the NLS1s may represent a crucial early phase In our sce-
nario the accretion rate m is large in the early stages of
evolution and reduces later on This is opposite to the pro-
posal by Wandel 1999 in which m increases with time
In fact there might be some NLS1s with a star burst
component see 2 Soft X-ray spectra of NLS1 are steep
and often variable However Page et al 1999 report that
while the power-law component in the NLS1 Mrk 766 var-
ied the thermal black-body component did not This com-
ponent might well be due to a nuclear starburst Note also
ccid13 2000 RAS MNRAS 000 15
the strong CO emission in the prototype NLS1 I Zw 1 Bar-
vainis Alloin  Antonucci 1989 Schinnerer Eckart  Tac-
coni 1998 mapped I Zw 1 in Co and found a circumnuclear
ring of diameter 18 kpc The authors found strong evidence
for a nuclear starburst There is also a companion to I Zw
1 supporting an interpretation of starburst due to inter-
action Similarly AGN activity is known to exist in star
burst galaxies see Heckman 1999 for a review Dennefeld
et al 1999 report observations of narrow optical emission
lines in a sample of IR selected starburst galaxies
5 OBSERVATIONAL TESTS
Here we propose several observations that could test the
ideas presented above 1 Emission line properties of high
redshift quasars Objects in the Shields  Hamann sample
for example were selected on the basis of their colors in
particular very red BR which results when Ly is red-
shifted into the R band This could lead to a selection bias
in favor of objects with narrow peaky proles Shields 
Hamann 1997 It would be important to remove such se-
lection bias before we can conclude that z 4 quasars have
narrow emission lines A broader wavelength coverage with
more than just two bands would be useful The drop-out
technique Steidel et al 1995 used for nding Lyman break
galaxies would be another way to remove emission line bias
2 X-ray properties of high redshift quasar Only about a
dozen z 4 quasars are detected in X-rays see the latest
update by Kaspi Brandt  Schneider 2000 However X-
ray spectra of z 4 quasars are still not available It will be
interesting to see if they are steep and highly variable like
those of NLS1s We will be studying X-ray spectra of radio-
loud as well as radio quiet z 4 quasars with XMM 3
Morphology and environment of NLS1s Are NLS1s prefer-
entially found in younger galaxies andor in more disturbed
environments A systematic study of host galaxy properties
of a well dened sample of NLS1s is needed 4 Search for
starburst components in NLS1s Evidence for the starburst
NLS1 connection 4 is suggestive but not yet statistically
sound Do the nuclear components of starburst galaxies show
narrow emission lines Do NLS1s show evidence of a star-
burst component more often than normal Seyferts Spectro-
scopic as well as high resolution imaging observations would
help towards establishing the connection between the two
6 ON THE CORRELATION OF FEII
STRENGTH AND X-RAY SPECTRAL
While photoionization models reproduce the properties of
optical and UV emission lines observed in AGN spectra with
reasonable success the case of FeII lines is dierent Wills
Netzer  Wills 1985 found that standard photoionization
models cannot explain the strength of the the observed FeII
lines in AGN Collin-Sourin and collaborators 1988 as
well as Kwan 1984 advocated that collisional ionization
would be important in the production of FeII Collin 1999
has again shown that strong FeII emission cannot be pro-
duced by photoionization with any set of parameters and
even by making iron abundance reasonably super-solar The
Smita Mathur
importance and necessity of collisional ionization of iron was
however not appreciated at least in part due to the observed
correlation between FeII4570 equivalent width and the soft
X-ray energy index Wilkes Elvis  McHardy 1987 Shas-
tri et al 1993 Standard photoionization models for the
line emission from the broad line regions of quasars Kro-
lik 1988 imply a close link between the energy index of
the ionizing X-ray continuum and the strength of emission
lines So the Wilkes et al
correlation
was interpreted as a result of photoionization Note how-
ever that the correlation is in in the opposite sense to that
predicted by the standard photoionization model in which
FeII emission is generated deep within the cloud and thus
is sensitive to harder X-rays NLS1s may provide us with
the clue to understand this observed conicting trend as
discussed below
and Shastri et al
As discussed in 1 there is a general consensus that
M MEdd is the likely driver of the many
large accretion rate
observed properties of NLS1s Large strength of FeII emis-
sion may then be linked to the large accretion rate In a
model by Kwan et al 1995 FeII line emission is produced
in an accretion disk The accretion disks with larger accre-
tion rate may simply have more mass to produce stronger
FeII Thus we argue that the observed correlation of FeII
strength and soft X-ray slope is a consequence of the corre-
lation with the accretion rate and support collisional ioniza-
tion as the origin
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have argued that NLS1s are likely to be AGN in the
making and reside in rejuvenated galaxies As such they rep-
resent a crucial early phase in the evolution of galaxies and
active galaxies What we need now is a systematic study of
host galaxy properties of a well dened sample of NLS1s and
their comparison with the hosts of normal Seyferts Some
evidence presented above is based on a small number of ob-
jects and generalization may not be appropriate Studies at
high redshift also suer from selection eects Understand-
ing and correcting for them is crucial in establishing the
analogy with NLS1s on rm footing X-ray spectra of high
redshift radio-quiet quasars will provide an addition piece of
information towards this goal It would of great interest to
nd out whether star burst galaxies are parent population
of NLS1s
