Abstract
As a response to ligand binding transmembrane cell receptors often en-
hance their clustering or oligomerization during the signalling process Here
we present a statistical mechanical model which combines the aspects of clus-
tering and signalling
In this model receptors oat on the surface while
for two neighboring receptors there is an interaction energy dependent on
their conformational states On the other hand ligand binding of a receptor
shifts the energy dierence between the two conformational states Due to
thermal uctuation the eects of clustering and signalling are statistical av-
erage quantities This model reduces to a oating Ising model with a random
eld We calculate the signalling in a grand canonical ensemble mean eld
approach using Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and replica method
Monte Carlo simulations are also performed Essential biological features are
obtained in our model

1 INTRODUCTION
On the surface of a cell there are many transmembrane receptor molecules They are
sensory machines of the cell Binding extracellular ligands changes the conformational
states or in our point of view the probability distribution of the conformational states
Consequently a cascade of responses occurs inside the cell This is called signalling which
is often quite sensitive An example is bacterial chemotaxis 1 through the detection by
its receptors a bacterium swims towards higher concentration of a chemical it likes or a
lower concentration of a chemical it dislikes
In this case thousands of receptors cluster
together at a pole of the cell Recently based on detailed analyses on the experimental
ndings I proposed that cooperative receptor-receptor interaction enhances the signalling
and constructed a statistical mechanical theory for this process 24 My idea has since
received considerable attention 1
In 4 good consistency was found in comparing this
theory with experimental results 510 and it was also suggested what kinds of experiment
are needed
In the case of many other cell receptors however usually they oat on the cell membrane
A ubiquitous phenomenon is that ligand binding enhances the clustering of receptors during
the signalling process Investigations on this issue are widely reported for various receptors
for example integins which attach cells to the extracellular matrix tyrosine kinase receptors
cytoskine receptors growth factor receptors tumor necrosis factor receptors including death
receptors antigen receptors such as T-cell receptors bone morphogenetic protein receptor
G-protein-coupled receptors etc 1119 In our previous works 24 the position of each
receptor is xed and there is an a priori cluster In the present article we shall consider
statistical mechanics of oating receptors Based on our model it is proposed that signalling
sensitivity and clustering enhancement in certain cases are likely two consequences of the
same mechanism based on conformation-dependent local receptor-receptor interaction
In Sec 2 we give a detailed description of the model A mean eld calculation of the
signalling as a statistical average quantity quantity is given in Sec 3 In Sec 4 we discuss
receptor clustering Results of Monte Carlo simulations are given in Sec 5 Finally a
summary and discussion is made in Sec 6
2 THE MODEL
Consider a collection of receptors on a lattice Fig 1 is an illustrative conguration
Let the coordinate number be  which is 6 for a honeycomb lattice and is 4 for a square
lattice Suppose that the receptors can move around on the lattice Hence at an instant
a receptor has   nearest-neighboring receptors The conformational state of the receptor
at lattice point i is represented as Vi the value of which is either V 0 or V 1 if we follow
the two-state convention Vi can be understood as the position of the receptor molecule
1The reference was mostly made to a publication which popularizes some rudiments of my idea
T Duke and D Bray Proc Nat Acad Sci 96 10104 1999 and the attribution of credit was
inappropriately made in T Duke N Le Novere and D Bray J Mol Bio 308 541 2001
Obviously Vi is inuenced by whether this receptor is bound to ligand We suggest that
Vi is also inuenced by the conformational states of its nearest-neighboring receptors due
to receptor-receptor interaction which is dependent on their conformational states We use
Hi to represent whether there is a ligand binding that is Hi  H 6 0 if the receptor is
bound to ligand otherwise Hi  0 H can be understood as the force or torque generated
by the ligand binding HVi is the energy due to ligand binding Given the ambient chemical
concentration L the occupancy ie the fraction of receptors with ligand bound is
L  Kd
where Kd is the dissociation constant Therefore each Hi is randomly distributed between
H and 0 with probabilities c and 1  c respectively Formally the probability distribution
can be written as
pHi  cHi  H  1  cHi
where x  0 if x 6 0 while R xdx  1 Since usually Kd  L it is reasonable to
regard the randomness of Hi as quenched 34
We associate each site i with a variable ni which is 1 if there is a receptor on this site
and is 0 otherwise In reality of course Vi and Hi are only dened when there is a receptor
on site i However because the presence or not of a receptor at site i has been determined
by ni for the convenience of treatment equivalently we may associate Vi and Hi to each site
i no matter whether there is a receptor on site i Since the receptors are allowed to diuse
ni is time-dependent One may constrain that the total number of receptors N  Pi ni is
conserved It is also possible that the receptors may get out of the relevant region hence N is
not conserved In any case we may use grand canonical ensemble approach characterized by
the chemical potential which in the rst case is given by the constraint on the conservation
of receptor number
Therefore in absence of thermal uctuation we have
Vi  Xj
tijnjVj  Hi  Ui with x   V 1 if x  0
V 0 if x  0
where the summation is over the nearest neighbors j of site i Ui is a threshold value Tij is a
coecient for the coupling between nearest neighbors Pj tijnjVj is the inuence ie force
or torque on the receptor at site i from the nearest-neighboring sites Hi is the inuence
ie force or torque generated by the ligand binding of the receptor at i itself Eq 3 means
that if the total inuence on a receptor as the sum of that due to its ligand binding and
that due to the interaction with the nearest-neighbors is larger than a certain value Ui the
receptors is in state V 1 Otherwise it is V 0 Equivalently with tij  tji and tii  0 the
dynamics is determined in the following Hamiltonian
H  tXhiji
ninjViVj Xi
HiniVi  U Xi
where hiji represents pairs of nearest neighbors tij and Ui have been set to be constants
Eq 4 gives the total energy of the system with the kinetic energy neglected The rst
term is the total interaction energy of nearest-neighboring pairs The second term is the
energy due to ligand binding The third term is the original energy which together with
the rst term determines the probability distribution of the conformational states of all
the receptors in the absence of ligand binding of any receptor Without ligand binding and
coupling with others the energy of a receptor is UV 0 for state V 0 and is UV 1 for state V 1
With ligand binding but without coupling it is U  HV 0 for state V 0 and is U  HV 1
for state V 1 The interaction energy of the pair hiji if sites i and j are both occupied by
receptors is tViVj the value of which is dependent on both Vi and Vj Since ligand binding
can cause more Vi to ip from V 0 to V 1 it is required that H  UV 1  V 0  0 Precise
form of H is subject to future experiments However 4 captures the essential elements
while allows a theoretical treatment
For convenience we transform to a spin language with the spin dened as
Vi  V 0
V 1  V 0  1
Hence it is Si  1 if Vi  V 1 and is Si  1 if Vi  V 0 In order to simplify the mathematics
without loss of the essence suppose V 1  V 0 Therefore we obtain the following simplied
Hamiltonian
H  J Xij
ninjSiSj Xi
BiniSi
with J  tV 1  V 024 Bi  Hi  UV 1  V 02 which is thus B1  H  UV 1  V 02
with probability c and is B2  UV 1  V 02 with probability 1  c ie
pBi  cBi  B1  1  cBi  B2
We call this model dened by 6 and 7 oating Ising model with a quenched random eld
at each site Note that it is not a diluted Ising model since ni is not a quenched disorder
but is a dynamical variable on the same footing as Si
It should be mentioned that a cell signalling process often involves dierent and largely
separated time scales On a much longer time scale the degrees of signalling and clustering
evolve after the stimulus till they return to the pre-stimulus levels So there is a piece of
short-time scale physics and there is a piece of long-time scale physics Here it suces to
discuss the the short-time scale physics ie the quasi-equilibrium part of the theory With
an incorporation of the feedback the long-time scale behavior is similar to that described in
Ref 34 With the adaptation process taken into account the ligand concentration above
should be replaced as the change of the ligand concentration However as studied in 34
perfect adaptation is equivalent to no ligand binding
Guo and Levine studied the clustering of receptors under the assumption that the in-
teraction between neighbors depends on whether the receptors are liganded 20 while the
signalling problem was not considered As described in our model We think that it is
more likely that the interaction depends on the conformations of the receptors rather than
whether the receptors are liganded
In addition to the consistency with the situation of
chemotaxis 24 this is also supported by the strong experimental evidence that oligomer-
ization is stabilized by receptor-receptor interaction promoted by conformational changes of
the receptors 11141819
3 MEAN-FIELD CALCULATION OF SIGNALLING
sites h  i represents ensemble average ie average over the probability distribution of all
possible congurations of the system It is straightforward to write it as V 1  V 0W2
The activity of the system is hPi niVii where the summation is over all the lattice
with W  hPi niSii  Im where m  hniSii is the average spin per site I is the number of
lattice sites The signalling can be characterized by the change of W when the occupancy
is changed from c  0 to c ie W c  W c  0  Imc  mc  0
Therefore we set out to calculate m as a function of c using grand canonical ensemble
approach The grand partition function is

15 and 16 can also be obtained in a simple mean eld approach regarding H  N
as an eective Hamiltonian and considering four possibilities of the state ni Si at site i
subject to an eective eld Jm  Bi
Hence we have obtained an analytical expression for the signalling as a statistical average
quantity If the receptor number is conserved in the system 16 gives  as a function of
the receptor number
Sensitivity of the signalling to ligand concentration is given by mc which can be
arbitrarily large
For annealed randomness which may apply to the rare case in which L is comparable
to Kd one may obtain

In the high temperature limit the dierence between 15 and 17 and that between
16 and 18 tend to diminish
4 CLUSTERING
The conformation-dependent interaction not only enhances signalling sensitivity it is
also responsible for clustering The rst term of the Hamiltonian 6 implies that in order
to minimize the Hamiltonian the receptors tend to aggregate together to maximize the
number of nonzero ninj with Si  Sj for neighboring hiji Therefore receptors with the
same conformational state tend to cluster However because of thermal uctuation they
cannot all cluster together since there is a probability distribution for various congurations
As an illustration of the situation a snapshot obtained in a Monte Carlo simulation is shown
in Fig 1
The second term in 6 determines how ligand binding aects the clustering situation It
can be seen that U determines the bias of the distribution of the receptor state Si between
1 and 1 when there is no ligand binding Hi  0 That is if U  0 for not-too-strong
interaction compared with the temperature J2 there is an equal number of receptors
with spin 1 and those with 1 If U  0 there are more receptors with spin 1 U also
determines whether ligand binding enhances or suppresses the clustering For example we
may consider two typical cases
Case i U  H According to 3 this means that merely a ligand binding of a receptor
is enough to change its conformational state In this case B1  0 B2  HV 1  V 02
Case ii U  0 According to 4 this means that in the absence of ligand binding
Hi  0 there is no bias in the state distribution In this case B1  HV 1 V 02 B2  0
These two cases can map to each other with the transformation H  H and c  1  c
In case i since B2  0 in the absence of ligand all Si tend to be close to 1 Ligand
binding causes more Si to be 1 Because receptors with the same value of Si tend to
cluster those with dierent Si tend to be disconnected the conclusion is that ligand binding
suppresses clustering
In case ii if there is no ligand binding there is no biasing eld so there are equal
probabilities for Si to be 1 and 1 consequently the clustering is minimized When there
is ligand binding the clustering is enhanced
For other values of U ie U 6 0 and U 6 H we have the following general picture
Without ligand binding there is a uniform eld B2 at every site In the presence of ligand
binding there is a random eld as given by 7 With a rough mean eld estimation one
may see that whether the clustering is enhanced depends on whether 1  cB2  cB1 has
larger absolute value than B2 Thus only if H  2Uc is the clustering enhanced by ligand
binding Case ii belongs to this region If U  H2 we have B1  B2
The clustering of receptors can be studied quantitatively by dening a clustering corre-
lation function as
hniniri  hni2
where the average is over dierent sites i and dierent directions of r rst and then over
the thermodynamic ensemble ie dierent possible congurations at the same temperature
2There is no such a limitation if the adaptation on a long time scale is considered see Ref 34
hni  hNiI is the density of receptors on the lattice If there is no clustering correlation
hninirihni2 consequently Cr  0 This correlation function measures the deviation
from the non-correlating case and allows comparison of situations for dierent receptor
densities This denition is similar to the two-point correlation function in the study of
galaxy clustering One may also dene higher-order correlation functions We leave for
future investigations the analytical calculation of the clustering correlation function and
turn to numerical simulations here
5 RESULTS OF MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS
To investigate the extent of clustering and to calculate the activity we have done Monte
Carlo simulations using the Metropolis algorithm on a square lattice In the simulations
we conserve the receptor numbers We have specically studied Case ii from which one
may obtain the results for case i simply by changing c to 1  c The results show strong
correlations for small values of r and weak correlations for large values of r The decay looks
like exponential as expected for a non-critical system
We studied correlation functions for dierent values of the ligand binding fraction c with
a same receptor density hni See Figs 2a and 2b for results under dierent values of the
coupling-noise-ratio J From the correlation function for small values of r it is clear that
the larger the ligand binding fraction c the larger the correlation This conrms the above
analyses
Comparing Figs 2a and 2b it can be seen that with larger coupling-noise ratio J
as in Fig 2a the correlation function Cr is larger at small values of r while smaller at
large values of r indicating that clustering is stronger On the other hand for larger J
the decay of Cr with r is faster because it is further from criticality
We also studied the correlation functions for dierent values of receptor densities hni with
a same ligand binding fraction c see Fig 2c It is shown that the smaller the receptor
density the larger the correlation function This can be understood since the larger the
density the less freedom two receptors can approach each other
In the simulations we also obtained the activity The activity W can also be written as
i represents summation over the receptors instead of the lattice sites Hence
i Si where P
it equals NM where M is the average activity per receptor
Fig 3 gives the relation between the average activity per receptor M and the ligand
binding occupancy c for dierent values of coupling-noise ratio J From the plots we see
that the activity increases with the ligand binding fraction c with J and with the receptor
density hni as consistent with the mean eld solution
6 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In this paper we propose a statistical mechanical theory which accounts for clustering
and signalling of receptors in a same framework Clustering and signalling of a network of
receptors are treated as statistical average quantities In our model which can be reduced
to a so-called oating Ising model in a random eld the interaction energy between neigh-
boring receptors depends on their conformational states therefore through this interaction
the conformational state of one receptor inuences those of its neighbors On the other
hand since the receptors are allowed to move on the membrane the receptors with a same
conformational state tend to cluster together in order to decrease the total energy of the
system Therefore clustering and signalling are unied as two consequences of the same
coupling between receptors
According to our theory clustering exists even in absence of the ligand binding This
is consistent with a recent experimental nding 18 We have studied clustering based on
an appropriate denition of clustering correlation function Monte Carlo simulations were
made To obtain the situation that ligand binding enhances the clustering a parameter
namely the threshold value U for the change of the conformational state which determines
the state distribution in the absence of ligand binding must be within a certain range If the
values of the variable characterizing the two conformational states are symmetric ie with
a same magnitude and with opposite signs then a simple possibility is that this threshold
value is zero We note that it was found experimentally that in the absence of ligands the
receptors are hindered to cluster by certain inhibitors which are squeezed out when ligands
bind 21 In such a case it may be constrained that clustering is always enhanced by ligand
binding
By using a mean eld theory based on Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation and replica
method as well as by using Monte Carlo simulations we also studied the activity as a
function of ligand binding fraction c
This model is also be interesting from the point of the view of statistical mechanics
On the other hand it is straightforward to make appropriate extensions of this model for
example to put in more details of the realistic systems The adaptation can be studied
by straightforwardly generalizing our previous approach based on a counteracting eld as
a feedback from the signal to the eld 3 In this case both signalling and clustering are
adapted through a feedback on a long time scale
A simple and direct experimental test of our theory is to examine whether conformational
state of a receptor can be changed by ligand binding of its nearest-neighboring receptors It is
interesting to study the forces generated by ligand bindings of a receptor and its neighbors
Parameters in our model need to be measured The techniques used in studying single
molecules may be useful for this subject
