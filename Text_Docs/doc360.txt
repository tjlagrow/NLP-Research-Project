Abstract We combine HST WFPC mosaics of clusters at multiple red-
shifts with Keck LRIS spectroscopy to characterize dierent galaxy pop-
ulations and how they evolve By combining quantitative measurements
of structural parameters with velocity dispersions line indices and mor-
phological types we attempt to establish links between ellipticals S0s
EAs and later type galaxies Here we focus on galaxies in CL135862
a massive cluster at z  033
Introduction
Using both high resolution imaging from HST WFPC2 and spectroscopy from
LRIS on Keck we study the cluster galaxy populations in CL135862 using
142 conrmed members The imaging provides colors morphological type and
quantitative structural parameters such as bulgetotal fraction bulge and disk
scale lengths half-light radius galaxy asymmetry and ellipticity The spec-
troscopy provides membership velocity dispersions masses and line indices
for measuring recent star formation eg H and OII With our complementary
approach we can place constraints on the evolution of cluster early-type ES0
and post-starburst EA galaxies in CL135862
2 Elliptical vs S0 A Matter of Viewing Angle
Jorgensen  Franx 1994 suggest that elliptical and S0 galaxies MB  22
are of the same galaxy class where Es are face-on members and S0s the more
edge-on ones ie these are the same galaxies where viewing angle is the primary
discriminator If the CL135862 sample has ellipticals that are mainly round
and S0s that are elongated while both share a similar bulge fraction BT 
distribution this would support a common parent population for both We
show the ellipticity distributions of Es and S0s in Fig 1 left Results from
the Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests of the BT and ellipticity distributions for this
sample supports a common parent population for ellipticals and S0s

Left Bulge fraction vs bulge ellipticity for ellipticals and
S0s we show only the most bulge-dominated galaxies BT  04
The BT distributions of Es and S0s are indistinguishable while their
ellipticity distributions do not share a common parent population

BT for a subset of ES0 Sa and EA members As the EAs in
CL135862 do not share the same velocity dispersion distribution as
the ES0 population they cannot evolve into massive ES0 galaxies
3 EA Galaxies What Do They Become
EA galaxies are still a mystery Dressler et al 1997 Spectroscopically dened
as galaxies that formed stars within the recent past  15 Gyr Balogh et
al 1999 they may be the transition between late type spirals and early type
systems If EAs are a snapshot in the transformation of the former to the
latter they are a fundamental phase in galaxy evolution
To test if EAs can evolve into the bright massive early type cluster
galaxies observed nearby we examine the bulge fraction bulge scale length
and velocity dispersion of EAs in CL135862 Their scale lengths and veloc-
ity dispersions Fig 1 right show a population dierent from ES0 galaxies
The EAs in CL135862 may evolve into early type systems but they cannot
become massive ones
