Abstract
The Hubble tuning fork diagram based on morphology has always been the
preferred scheme for classication of galaxies and is still the only one originally
built from historicalevolutionary relationships At the opposite biologists have
long taken into account the parenthood links of living entities for classication
purposes Assuming branching evolution of galaxies as a descent with modi-
cation we show that the concepts and tools of phylogenetic systematics widely
used in biology can be heuristically transposed to the case of galaxies This
approach that we call astrocladistics has been rst applied to Dwarf Galaxies
of the Local Group and provides the rst evolutionary galaxy tree The clado-
gram is sufciently solid to support the existence of a hierarchical organization
in the diversity of galaxies making it possible to track ancestral types of galax-
ies We also nd that morphology is a summary of more fundamental properties
Astrocladistics applied to cosmology simulated galaxies can unsurprisingly re-
construct the correct genealogy It reveals evolutionary lineages divergences
from common ancestors character evolution behaviours and shows how merg-
ers organize galaxy diversity Application to real normal galaxies is in progress
Astrocladistics opens a new way to analyse galaxy evolution and a path towards
a new systematics of galaxies

Introduction
Galaxies have been found by Hubble to be isolated systems of stars Hubble
1922 1926 We know they also contain gas and dust while black holes are
certainly rather common The Hubble 1936 diagram was originally devised
to introduce evolution as a link between the different morphological types
This unication scheme has lost its meaning but the Hubble tuning fork re-
mains a reference in depicting galaxy diversity However numerous classi-
cations attached to particular observational criteria have appeared rendering
difcult a visualisation of evolution of galaxies globally
The biological world is also made of complex objects in evolution The
hierarchical organization of diversity on a tree-like structure is caused by evo-
lution in a descent with modication scheme Darwin 1859 A long history
of classication of living organisms has lead to the establishment of powerful
methodologies to reveal the evolutionary relationships between the different
species One of the most widely used nowadays is cladistics Hennig 1965 It
does not compare objects on appearance or global similarity but rather on the
evolutionary states of their characters descriptors
An attempt to apply such a methodology to astrophysics was proposed by
Fraix-Burnet et al 2003 Astrocladistics has thus been developed through
some conceptualization and formalization of galaxy classication formation
evolution and diversication Several samples have now been analysed
this talk I present a summary of the present status of astrocladistics and its
achievements More details are to be found elsewhere Fraix-Burnet et al

Some basics of astrocladistics
The detailed presentation of astrocladistics with its formalism concepts and
tools is done in Fraix-Burnet et al 2004b 2004c Only a very brief overview
is given in this section
A galaxy is fully described and characterized by its basic constituents stars
gas dust and all their properties A galaxy is thus a complex object
evolution is the evolution of its constituents so that their properties can be seen
as characters with different evolutionary states Hence a galaxy is represented
by a vector having as many components as characters or descriptors allowed
by observations
The formation of a galaxy should be understood as the formation of the
galaxy as we see it that is with all the character states as observed Hence
any physical or chemical process that affects any of its properties may result
in the formation of a new galaxy of a different class or species We have iden-
tied ve such formation processes Fraix-Burnet et al 2004c assembling
secular evolution interaction accretion-merging ejection-sweeping In each
case material basic constituents of the progenitors is transmitted to the de-
scendant while being modied This is fundamentally the darwinian descent
with modication mechanism A big difference is that in the case of galaxies
the modication is much more brutal because a galaxy can give birth to a new
galaxy of a different species
Evolution of galaxies is governed by these formation processes which occur
several times during the history of the Universe always in different conditions
Diversity is thus generated and is organized in a hierarchical way Note that
this has nothing to do with the hierarchical scenario of galaxy formation that
considers only the mass The astrocladistic analysis using the matrix made
with the galaxies and their characters tries to arrange the objects on a tree-
First phylogenetic analyses of galaxy evolution
like structure grouping them from the derived evolved that is inherited from
a common ancestor character states they share It is then possible to dene
species or classes and thus build a phylogenetic classication
Analyses of two samples of simulated galaxies
In order to illustrate the validity of our approach and to better understand
the application of cladistics to astrophysics two samples of simulated galaxies
have been analysed Fraix-Burnet et al 2004b 2004c They were extracted
from the GALICS Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations database which
results from a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies combin-
ing the outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple semi-
analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within dark matter haloes
Hatton et al 2003 The main advantage is that the entire history is known for
each galaxy with all the formation processes and progenitors Note that cladis-
tics does not aim at reconstructing genealogies which in reality would require
the impossible identication of all parents but phylogenetic trees which re-
veal the evolutionary relationships Galaxies in GALICS are characterized
principally by photometric properties about 100
The rst sample 50 galaxies is made with galaxies that have never known
any merging so that their diversication is due simply to secular evolution
and gas accretion no interaction are considered in the simulations We show
Fraix-Burnet et al 2004b that astrocladistics correctly establishes the right
chronology Diversity in this case is organized in a hierarchical pattern as
expected
Among the ve formation processes merging of galaxies is somewhat pe-
culiar First it clearly illustrates how galaxies disappear to form a new one
an important concept in astrocladistics whatever the formation process Sec-
ond the transmitted material of the merging galaxies is mixed together This
might look like biological hybridization which is known to affect the tree-like
structure of diversity However we show that this is not the case and conrm
our conclusion using a sample with 43 galaxies having underwent different
numbers of mergers in their history Fraix-Burnet et al 2004c
Origin of the morphological dichotomy in the Dwarf
galaxies of the Local Group
The rst application of astrocladistics to real galaxies has been performed
on the Dwarf galaxies of the Local Group Fraix-Burnet et al 2004a The
36 objects are described by 24 characters photometry masses line uxes
metallicity kinematics plus morphology spheroidal irregular or intermedi-
ate Since this last parameter is the only one to be qualitative and subjective
it has not been considered in the analysis but merely projected on the result
A robust tree is found showing for the rst time that diversity among a
sample of real galaxies is organized hierarchically Not only does this validates
our approach but the power of a cladistic analysis can now be exploited for
galaxies One very important result is that the morphological segregation is
found and explained
irregular galaxies are all gathered on a branch which
separated from spheroidal galaxies sometimes in the evolution because of a
strong accretion of hydrogen This is an indication that morphology is kind
of a gross summary of more fundamental properties However the tree brings
much more information in the form of consistent evolutionary interpretations
For instance some objects are known to be exceptionally bright for spheroidal
dwarf galaxies as bright as irregulars Our result yields a simple explanation
luminosity increases during evolution and these objects happen to be more
evolved than other spheroidals and as much as irregulars
Virgo galaxies rst step toward a new classication
Two samples of galaxies belonging to the Virgo cluster are currently being
analysed Fraix-Burnet and Davoust 2004 Results are still preliminary but
a robust tree has been found with a sub-sample of 21 galaxies described by
35 characters large band and line photometry some kinematical data and line
ratios This shows that the hierarchical organization of galaxy diversity exists
among real galaxies Equally important our study reveals a large consistency
among evolution of most characters For instance blue luminosity B-V and
U-B colours line widths maximum velocity dispersion do all evolve quite
regularly along the tree It is thus possible to dene different classes that are
evolutionary related More work has to be done for a complete interpretation
In the analysis like in others qualitative characters such as morphological
type and presenceabsence of a bar were not used But their projection after-
wards onto the result tree is very informative First the morphological type
evolves quite regularly along the tree again demonstrating that it is kind of
a gross summary of more fundamental and quantitative properties of galaxies
Second the character presence or absence of a bar is erratic on the tree being
apparently not relevant for the evolutionary state of a galaxy
Conclusions
Astrocladistics is now producing more and more results while the concepts
and tools have been largely claried in the frame of galaxy diversity and evo-
lution The two fundamental ingredients a galaxy is described by evolutive
characters diversity is caused by evolution and organized in a hierarchy have
been validated
First phylogenetic analyses of galaxy evolution
The application of cladistics to galaxy evolution requires a precise formal-
ization of some denitions and concepts In particular it makes a difference
between the denition the description and the nomenclature of galaxies This
leads to the obvious result that the evolution of a galaxy is the evolution of its
fundamental constituents Their properties are the true descriptors of galax-
ies and characterize their evolution This has been successfully checked on
simulated and real galaxies
The hierarchical organization of galaxy diversity expected from the forma-
tion processes that generate new galaxy species is found in all samples studied
so far either simulated or real This is an extremely important result because
if the existence of a tree-like structure remains true for all classes of galaxies
at all epochs it then will be possible to track the ancestral galaxy species back
to the very rst objects of the Universe
Astrocladistics is a methodology to understand galaxy diversity via evolu-
tionary relationships
It groups objects according to their history and using
evolutionary states of their characters It naturally builds a classication but
this can be done only after several analyses of different kinds of galaxies are
achieved This will be the next step of our work and this new galaxy classi-
cation will be based on solid taxonomical rules
