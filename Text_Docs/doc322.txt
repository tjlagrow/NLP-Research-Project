In this review I discuss some highlights of recent research
Abstract
on molecular gas in galaxies large-scale CO maps of nearby galaxies are
being made which extend our knowledge on global properties radial gra-
dients and spiral structure of the molecular ISM Very high resolution
are provided by the interferometers that reveal high velocity gradients
in galaxy nuclei and formation of embedded structures like bars within
bars Observation of the CO and other lines in starburst galaxies have
questioned the H2-to-CO conversion factor Surveys of dwarfs have shown
how the conversion factor depends on metallicity The molecular content
is not decient in galaxy clusters as is the atomic gas Galaxy interactions
are very eective to enhance gas concentrations and trigger starbursts
Nuclear disks or rings are frequently observed that concentrate the star
formation activity Since the density of starbursting galaxies is strongly
increasing with redshift the CO lines are a privileged tool to follow evo-
lution of galaxies and observe the ISM dynamics at high redshift due to
the high excitation of the molecular gas the stronger high-J CO lines are
redshifted into the observable band which facilitates the detection
In the last years progress has been very rapid in the domain of
molecules at high redshift and we now know in better detail the molecular
content in several systems beyond z  1 and up to z  5 either through
millimeter and sub-millimeter emission lines continuum dust emission or
millimeter absorption lines in front of quasars More and more systems
are gravitationally lensed which helps the detection but also complicates
the interpretation The detection of all these systems could give an answer
about the debated question of the star-formation rate as a function of
redshift The maximum of star-formation rate found around z  2 from
optical studies could shift to higher z if the most remote objects are
hidden by dust
1 CO and H2 content of galaxies
Although the molecular component is a key parameter for the star formation
history and the evolution of galaxy disks their H2 content is still very uncertain
mainly because the bulk of the gas is not seen directly but through questionable
tracers such as the CO lines The wider surveys now available together with the
observations of starbursts and the more sensitive observations of low metallicity
galaxies now have revealed how variable can be the CO to H2 conversion ratio
Figure 1

type full squares mean values with upper limits treated as detections
empty squares mean values with upper limits taken into account using
the survival analysis SA from Casoli et al 1998
that was previously thought constant within  50 Young  Scoville 1991
Also the rst surveys were oriented towards star forming galaxies selected
from far-infrared IRAS samples and those happened to be rich CO emitters
according to the well established FIR-CO correlation When more galaxies are
included the derived H2HI mass ratio in galaxies becomes lower than 1 the
previously established value to be around 02 in average Casoli et al 1998
The dependence of the molecular content with type also has been rened
the apparent H2HI mass ratio decreases monotonously from SO to Sm galaxies
but the extremes were separated by a factor 20-30 Young  Knezek 1989
which is now reduced to about 10 cf g1 Casoli et al 1998 This gradient
towards the late-types might be only due to a reduced CO emission because of
metallicity eects and not to an intrinsic reduction of the H2 content When
only the more massive objects are taken into account this tendency with type
does not appear there is no gradient of molecular fraction This supports the
hypothesis that the gradient is due to metallicity which is correlated with total
The dependence of the CO-to-H2 conversion factor X with metallicity has
been conrmed now in many galaxies In the Small Magellanic Clouds X could
be 10 times higher than the standard value of 23 1020 mol cm2 Kkms1
Rubio et al 1993 The eect has been seen also in local group galaxies such
as M31 M33 NGC 6822 and IC10 Wilson 1995 The physical explanation
is complex since the CO lines are optically thick but the size of the clouds

Dust emission radial prole in NGC 4565 compared to
and therefore the lling factor decreases with metallicity both due to direct
CO abundance and UV-phtotodissociation increased by the depletion of dust
When the dust is depleted by a factor 20 there is only 10 less H2 but 95 less
CO Maloney  Black 1988
Another tracer of the molecular gas has been widely used in recent years
cold dust emission through galaxy mapping with bolometers at 13mm The
technique is best suited to edge-on galaxies since a nearby empty reference posi-
tion must be frequently observed to eliminate atmospheric gradients One of the
rst observed NGC 891 has a radial dust emission prole exactly superposable
to the CO-emission prole Guelin et al 1993 At 3mm the dust is completely
optically thin and therefore the emission is proportional to the dust abundance
or the metallicity Z The identity between the dust and CO emission proles
tend to conrm the strong dependence of CO emission with Z In some galaxies
the CO emission falls o radially even faster than the dust emission it is the
case of NGC 4565 or NGC 5907 for example cf g 2 Neininger et al 1996
In those galaxies where the CO emission falls faster than dust emission
the latter is correlated to the HI distribution see also the case of NGC 1068
Papadopoulos  Seaquist 1999 This could be interpreted by two eects there
is an extended diuse molecular component not visible in the CO lines because
the H2 density is not sucient to excite the CO lines or the CO abundance
is depending non-linearly with metallicity ie decreases more than the dust
which abundance is linear in Z This might be the case in dwarf galaxies as
discussed in the next section

2 CO in dwarf galaxies and Blue Compact starbursts
Much eort has been devoted to the detection of CO lines in blue compact
dwarf galaxies BCDGs their high star formation rates is assumed to require
a large H2 content and its detection will help to understand the star formation
mechanisms and eciencies But the task has revealed very dicult since the
objects have low masses and low metallicity Arnault et al
1988 already
suggested that X was varying as Z1 and even as Z2 in a certain domain
but this was contested Sage et al 1992 Recent results improve considerably
the detection rate and the upper limits because of the technical progress in the
receivers Barone et al 1998 Gondhalekar et al 1998 They conrm the high
dependence on metallicity of the CO emission
Taylor et al 1998 have tried to detect in CO HI-rich dwarf galaxies in
which the oxygen abundance was known They have stringent upper limits on
the most metal-poor galaxies and conclude that the conversion factor must be
varying nonlinearly with metallicity increasing sharply below 110 of the solar
metallicity 12  log OH  79 cf gure 3
3 Low surface brightness galaxies LSB
Low surface brightness galaxies may provide a clue to the galaxy evolution pro-
cesses they appear to be unevolved galaxies with large gas fraction which may
have formed their stars only on the second half of the Hubble time McGaugh
 de Blok 1997 Their metallicity is low according to the correlation of metal-
licity with surface brightness Vila-Costas  Edmunds 1992 Some can have
however very large masses and large rotational velocities implying large dark
matter fractions To tackle the mystery of their low-evolution rate it is of
prime importance to know their molecular content and their total gas surface
density De Blok  van der Hulst 1998 have made a search for CO line emis-
sion in 3 late-type LSB galaxies they nd a clear CO-emission deciency and
conclude to a molecular gas deciency They claim that the conversion factor X
has not the same reasons to be higher than in normal late-type galaxies since
the star formation rate is smaller than in HSB galaxies implying a lower UV
ux that does not photodissociate as much the CO molecules However their
derived upper limits of the MH2MHI mass ratio fall in the same range as
in HSB late-type galaxies the question of their true molecular component is
still open the more so as early-type LSB galaxies are detected in CO Note
that there exists a large scatter of CO-emission or H2 content even in normal
galaxies and this is not well understood in M81 for example a particularly low
H2HI interacting galaxy with normal metallicity the molecular clouds appear
to have dierent characteristics with a lower velocity dispersion at a given size
Brouillet et al 1998
Even with normal H2HI mass ratio close to 1 the gas surface density of
those LSB galaxies is lower than critical for gravitational instabilities and that
is sucient to explain the low eciency of star formation van der Hulst et al
1993 van Zee et al 1997 These low surface densities could come from the
poor environment and the lack of companions Zaritsky  Lorrimer 1993
4 Spiral Structure
It becomes now possible to map in the CO lines galaxies at large-scale and
with high spatial resolution to have an overview of the molecular structure of a
galaxy with a high dynamical range With the On-The-Fly mapping procedure
Neininger et al 1998a have surveyed nearly half of the M31 disk in CO10
with 23 90pc resolution and they have detailed some remarkable regions at
2 resolution with the IRAM interferometer Apart from emphasizing the fractal
structure of the molecular gas over such large range of scales this study reveals
a tight correlation between the CO arms and the dust lanes and also with the
HI arms At this scale the kinematics of the CO lines are more dominated by
the star forming shells and the resulting chaotic motions in the arms than by
large-scale streaming motions In the global sense the spiral structure of this
galaxy is not well determined due to projection eects and it is possible that
the ISM is concentrated more in a ring that in spiral arms see the ISOPHOT
map from Haas et al 1998
The BIMA interferometer group has undertaken a survey of 44 nearby galax-
ies SONG with large elds of view mosaics of 7 elds of 3-4 with 7 angular
resolution cf poster by Helfer et al this conference There is a large range of
CO morphologies detected among spirals bars and rings The spiral structure
of M51 is particularly detailed and the arm-interarm contrast deduced more
exactly including short-spacing
5 Centers of galaxies
High-resolution CO maps of galaxy centers at 100pc or less have been obtained
with interferometers One of the striking features of the central H2-component
structure is the strong asymmetry observed similar to what happens in the
center of the Milky Way the gas distribution is lopsided and this appears to
be the rule more than the exception
One of the best example is the CO-rich M82 galaxy Neininger et al 1998b
have recently performed a 4 resolution 13CO map with the IRAM interferom-
eter The map shows the same gross features as the 12CO one made by Shen 
Lo 1995 ie a compact central source and two oset maxima that could be
the signature of an edge-on ring However the central peak has a low 13CO
12CO ratio may be due to a large UV-photodissociation aecting selectively
more the rarer isotopic species
There is a strong velocity gradient in the CO which is also a general rule in
spiral galaxies cf Sofue et al 1997 The dynamical centre coincides with the
IR peak and is shifted 6 north-east of the compact 13CO source emphasizing
the lopsidedness The kinematics is also perturbed by star-formation shells and
around the most luminous compact radio source in M 82 is identied a 130
pc-wide bubble of molecular gas
Another example is the edge-on warped galaxy NGC 5907 mapped in CO
at 3 resolution by Garcia-Burillo et al 1997 Spiral structure can be resolved
in the center which means that the galaxy is not completely edge-on or strongly
warped even in the molecular component Non-circular motions are well ex-
plained by a bar rotating at a pattern speed of b  70 kmskpc high enough
to be that of a nuclear bar The velocity gradient is high in the center resulting
from a massive and compact nuclear disk This is interesting since this galaxy
could be classied as an early-type according to its nuclear velocity gradient
but has no bulge and is in fact classied as an Sc-Sd late-type The molecular
distribution is signicantly o-centered and lopsided also in this galaxy
6 Double bars and nuclear disks
Barred galaxies are conspicuous in general by their high concentrations of molec-
ular gas in the center They often possess nuclear disks or large attened gas
concentrations in fast rotation within the central 1kpc This large molecular
gas concentration can trigger starbursts sometimes conned in nuclear rings
hot spots in H
The molecular distribution can have several morphologies according to the
presence of zero one or two inner Lindblad resonances in the center When
there are Lindblad resonances the gas accumulates in a spectacular twin-peaks
morphology Kenney 1996 corresponding to the crossing of the x1 orbits par-
allel to the bar and the x2 orbits perpendicular to it inside the ILR generally
materialised by a nuclear ring This typical structure is nicely seen in NGC1530
mapped in CO by Reynaud  Downes 1997 the twin peaks are at the be-
ginning of the characteristic thin dust lanes aligned with and leading the bar
In rare cases there is only a single peak may be due to the interaction with a
companion cf NGC5850 Leon et al 1999 When there is no ILR in late-type
Figure 4

only one pattern speed top   23 kmskpc amd with two dierent
pattern speeds for the two embedded bars bottom   23 and 160
kmskpc in M100 from Garcia-Burillo et al 1998a Only in the
second case a nuclear spiral structure is obtained similar to the one
observed in CO
galaxies for instance or when the pattern speed is relatively high there is no
ring and only a central concentration cf NGC 7479 Laine et al 1998
Bars within bars is a frequently observed phenomenon easy to see on color-
color plots or in NIR images of galaxies to avoid dust extinction The presence
of an embedded bar has long been invoked as a mechanism to prolonge the non-
axisymmetry and the resulting gravity torques towards the center to drive
the gas and fuel an AGN Shlosman et al 1989 Simulations have described the
numerical processus leading to the formation of double bars Friedli  Martinet
1993 Combes 1994 In concentrating the mass towards the center the rst bar
modies the inner rotation curve and the precessing rate   2 of the m  2
elliptical orbits in the center increases to large values This widens the region
between the two ILRs and mass accumulate on the perpendicular x2 orbits
which weakens the principal bar in this region This strong dierential   2
prevents the self-gravity from matching all precessing rates in the center and
decoupling occurs two bars rotating at two dierent pattern speeds develop
Eventually a too large mass accumulation into the center can destroy the bar
Hasan et al 1993 To probe this scenario in double-bar galaxies it is important
to know the pattern speeds of the two bars and derive the dynamical processus
at play
A prototype of double-bar galaxies is NGC4321 or M100 cf Knapen 
Beckman 1996 The study of its molecular cloud distribution has been done at
high resolution towards its central parts including the nuclear bar Sakamoto
et al 1995 Garcia-Burillo et al 1998a A small nuclear spiral structure has
been detected inside the nuclear ring made of the star-forming hot spots This
morphology requires a model of nuclear bar with a very fast pattern speed 
 160 kmskpc see g 4 from Garcia-Burillo et al 1998a
Sometimes the gas in the center is also observed at high altitude above the
plane cf NGC 891 5907 or N 4013 Garcia-Burillo et al 1999 These might be
accounted for by processes associated to the star-formation more than purely
dynamical mechanisms The only exception could be gas in retrograde orbits
Garcia-Burillo et al 1998b report for the rst time the detection of a
massive counterrotating molecular gas disk in the early-type spiral NGC3626
The CO emission is concentrated in a compact nuclear disk of average radius
r  12 12 kpc rotating in a sense opposite to that of the stars and in the
same sense as the HII and HI gas themselves counterrotating with respect to
the stars There is no evidence of a violent starburst in the center of the galaxy
which corresponds probably to the late stage of a merger
7 Molecular content of cluster galaxies
Although many spiral galaxies in clusters are stripped from their HI gas it has
been established that they are not decient in CO-emission and probably also
H2 Kenney  Young 1989 for Virgo Boselli et al 1995 Casoli et al 1998
for Coma This can be understood since the HI is usually located in the outer
parts of galaxies where the gas is less bound and the tidal forces are larger
also the HI gas is more diuse and easier to deplace by ram pressure
In Hickson compact groups the molecular gas is not decient either and
even enhanced in tidally interacting galaxies Boselli et al 1996 Leon et al
1998 cf gure 5
In a particular Hickson group the Stephans Quintet Xu
 Tus 1998 have recently found evidence of a starburst going on outside
galaxies From ISOCAM 15 m H and NIR observations they identied an
outstanding bright source about 25kpc away from the neighbouring galaxies
containing very young stars and corresponding to an SFR of about 07 Myr
They propose that the starburst is triggered by the collision between a fast
galaxy an the IGM alternatively this could be the formation of a tidal dwarf
through gravitational instabilities in a tidal tail cf Duc  Mirabel 1998 Molec-
ular gas through CO emission is dicult to detect so far from the nuclei pos-
sibly because of metallicity gradients and the detection in tidal tails are rare
like that in the NGC 2782 Arp 215 tail by Smith et al 1998
8 Ultra-luminous IRAS galaxies
A new survey of ultra-luminous infrared galaxies with millimeter interferometer
reveals that the molecular gas is conned in compact rotating nuclear disks or
rings Downes  Solomon 1998 The constraint that the gas mas is smaller
than the dynamical mass imposes an excitation model in which the CO lines are
only moderately optically thick   4  10 and subthermally excited so that
the CO-to-H2 conversion ratio is about 5 times less than standard In that case
the fraction gas-to-dynamical mass is 15 The surface density of gas however
is in average gtot  30 In some cases the CO position-velocity diagrams
clearly shows a ring with a central gap In the particular case of Arp 220 there
Figure 5

Pairs and starbursts Cluster Elliptical and Dwarfs from Leon et al
1998
appears to be two bright sources embedded in a central nuclear disk which are
compact extreme starburst regions more likely than the premerger nuclei as
was previously thought
An often debated question is whether the huge far infrared emission of the
ultra-luminous galaxies are due to a starburst or a monster AGN It is frequent
that both are present simultaneously since they are both the results of huge
mass accumulation in the centers of galaxies Using ISO data and diagnostic
diagrams involving the ratio of high-to-low excitation mid-IR emission lines
together with the strength of the 77 m PAH feature Genzel et al 1998
conclude that the far infrared emission appears to be powered predominantly
by starbursts 70-80 are predominantly powered by recently formed massive
stars and 20-30 are powered by a central AGN Very high extinctions are
measured towards these star-forming regions supporting the high H2 column
densities derived from CO observations In these objects the active region is
always sub-kpc in size
9 Galaxies at high redshift
One of the most exciting results of these last years is the detection of galaxies at
larger and larger redshifts allowing to tackle the evolution and history of star
formation in the Universe After the rst discovery in CO lines of an object
at z  2 the ultraluminous galaxy IRAS 102144724 Brown  van den Bout
1992 Solomon et al 1992 there has been an extended search for more early
starbursts that resulted in the discovery of about 10 objects at high z in CO
lines cf Table 1

1997 9 Omont et al 1996a
In fact the majority of these objects if not all are amplied by gravita-
tional lenses and this explains why they are detectable at all see gure 6
The amplication is very helpful to detect these remote objects but the draw-
backs are signicant uncertainties in the amplication factors and therefore on
the total molecular content The excitation of the gas is also uncertain since
the various CO lines emission may have dierent spatial extents and dierent
resulting amplications
One strategy to search for CO lines in high-z galaxies has been to select
objects already detected in the far-infrared or submm dust emission Indeed
all objects in Table 1 have been rst detected in continuum some the SMM
have been discovered in blank eld searches with the SCUBA bolometer on
JCMT Hawaii by Smail et al 1997 Since the emission of the dust is varying
as  4 with the frequency  in the millimeter range until the maximum near
60m it becomes easier to detect galaxies at z  5 than z  1 cf Blain 
Longair 1993 The millimeter domain is then a privileged one to follow the
star-formation history as a function of redshift and several surveys have been
undertaken Searches toward the Hubble Deep Field-North Hughes et al 1998
and towards the Lockman hole and SSA13 Barger et al 1998 have found a
few sources revealing an increase of starbursting galaxies with redshift They
correspond by extrapolation to a density of 800 per square degree above 3 mJy
at 850 m This already can account for 50 of the cosmic infra-red background
CIRB that has been estimated by Puget et al 1996 and Hauser et al 1998

et al 1997 open pentagons and to the Coma supercluster sample
from Casoli et al 1996 lled triangles There is no detected object
between 03 and 22 in redshift except the quasar 3c48 marked as a
lled dot Scoville et al 1993 Wink et al 1997 The curve indicates the
3 detection limit of ICO  1 K kms at the IRAM-30m telescope
equivalent to an rms of 1mK with an assumed V  300kms The
points at high z can be detected well below this limit since they are
gravitationally amplied
from COBE data Similar conclusions have been reached towards the CFRS
elds by Eales et al 1999
These rst results show the potentiality of the millimeter domain already
with the present instruments With the fore-coming next generation of mm
telescopes which will yield a factor 10-20 increase in sensitivity it will be possible
to detect not only huge starbursts but more ordinary galaxies at high redshift
