Summary We have constructed a large uniform galaxy cluster catalog from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey data By studying the morphologycluster-centric-radius
relation we have found two characteristic environments where galaxy morphologies
change dramatically indicating there exist two dierent physical mechanisms re-
sponsible for the cluster galaxy evolution We also found an unusual population of
galaxies which have spiral morphology but do not have any emission lines indicat-
ing these spiral galaxies do not have any on-going star formation activity More in-
terestingly these passive spiral galaxies preferentially exist in the cluster outskirts
Therefore these passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a key galaxy population
being transformed from blue star-forming galaxies into red early-type galaxies
1 The Sloan Digital Sky Survey
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS1 is both an imaging and spectroscopic
survey of a quarter of the sky Imaging part of the survey takes CCD images
of the sky in ve optical bands u g r i and z2 The spectroscopic part of
the survey observes one million galaxies Due to its large quantity and superb
quality the SDSS provides us with an excellent data set to tackle the long
standing problems on environmental eects on galaxy evolution
2 The SDSS Cut  Enhance Galaxy Cluster Catalog
The SDSS Cut  Enhance galaxy cluster catalog CE3 is one of the initial
attempts to produce a cluster catalog from the SDSS imaging data It uses
generous color-cuts to eliminate fore- and background galaxies when detecting
clusters Its selection function is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation
The accuracy of photometric redshift is z0015 at z03 For a cluster
catalog from the spectroscopic sample of the SDSS see 456
3 The Morphology-Density Relation
Using a volume limited sample of 7938 spectroscopic galaxies 005z01
M r -205 we investigated the morphologycluster-centric-radius relation

spiral galaxies classied with the automated method T auto respectively

ux radius in r band is used to calculate physical sizes of galaxies A solid line
shows medians It turns over around T auto 0 corresponding to S0 population
in the SDSS 7 We classied galaxies using the T auto method which uti-
lizes concentration and coarseness of galaxies see 8 for more details of
T auto We measured the distance to the nearest cluster using the C4 cluster
catalog9 In Fig1 morphological fractions of E S0 Sa and Sc galaxies are
shown in the short-dashed solid dotted and long-dashed lines as a function
of cluster-centric-radius Around 1 Rvir fractions of Sc start to decrease
Around 03 Rvir S0 starts to decrease and E starts to increase These two
changes imply there might be two dierent physical mechanisms responsible
for cluster galaxy evolution Since a physical size of S0 galaxies T auto0 is
smaller than E and Sc T auto2 and -1 in Fig2 the results are consistent
with the hypothesis that in the cluster outskirts stripping creates small S0
galaxies from spiral galaxies and in the cluster cores the merging of S0s
results in a large Es
4 The Passive Spiral Galaxies
In a similar volume limited sample of the SDSS we have found an interest-
ing class of galaxies with spiral morphologies Fig 3 and without any star
formation activity shown by the lack of emission lines in the spectrum Fig
4 These galaxies are called passive spiral galaxies and interesting since

they are against currently favored galaxy formation models in which star-
formation is sustained by the density waves Using a volume-limited sample
005 z 01 and M r  205 25813 galaxies of the SDSS data we found
73 028003 passive spiral galaxies and studied their environments It is
found that passive spiral galaxies exist in a local galaxy density of 12 Mpc2
and have a 110 cluster-centric virial radius Figs 5 and 6 10 In other
words passive spirals preferentially exist in the cluster infalling regions This
is the rst direct evidence to connect the origin of passive spiral galaxies to
cluster related physical mechanisms These characteristic environments coin-
cide with a previously reported environment where the galaxy star-formation
rate suddenly declines11 and the so-called morphology-density relation turns
See Section 3 It is likely that the same physical mechanism is responsible
for all of these observational results in the cluster infalling regions The ex-
istence of passive spiral galaxies suggests that a physical mechanism that
works calmly eg gas stripping is preferred to dynamical origins such as
major mergerinteraction since such a mechanism would destroy the spiral-
arm structures Passive spiral galaxies are likely to be a key galaxy popu-
lation in transition between red early-type galaxies in low-redshift clusters
and blue spiral galaxies more numerous in higher-redshift clusters

measured based on the distance to the 5th nearest galaxy within 3000 kms
A Kolomogorov-Smirnov test shows distributions of passive spirals and all galax-
ies are signicantly dierent A long dashed line shows the distribution of cluster
galaxies A short dashed line shows that of active spiral galaxies Both of them are
statistically dierent from that of passive spirals

centric-radius The solid dashed and dotted lines show the distributions of passive
spiral elliptical and active spiral galaxies respectively The distributions are rel-
ative to that of all galaxies in the volume limited sample and normalized to be
unity for clarity The cluster-centric-radius is measured as a distance to a nearest
C4 cluster9 within 3000 kms and normalized by virial radius 12
5 Conclusions
We have constructed a large uniform galaxy cluster catalog from the SDSS
data in order to investigate physical mechanisms responsible for the clus-
ter galaxy evolution By revealing the morphologycluster-centric-radius re-
lation with the largest statistics to date we have found two characteristic
environments where galaxy morphology changes dramatically suggesting the
existence of two dierent physical mechanisms in the cluster regions In ad-
dition we have found unusual galaxies with spiral morphology but without
any emission lines More interestingly we found that these passive spiral
galaxies preferentially exist in the cluster infalling regions indicating that
they are likely to be transition objects between eld star-forming spirals and
red cluster early-type galaxies due to the environmental eects in the cluster
outskirts
