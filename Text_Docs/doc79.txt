ABSTRACT
A strictly empirical review is given of presently available data on the evolution
of galaxy morphology From HST observations of distant galaxies and ground-
based observations of nearby ones observed at the same rest-frame wavelength
it is found that late-type Sbc-Sc galaxies evolve more rapidly with increasing
redshift than do early-type E-Sa-Sab galaxies Furthermore the fraction of
peculiar objects that cannot be shoehorned into the Hubble tuning fork classi-
cation scheme increases rapidly with redshift Unexpectedly it is found that
over a wide range of densities the fraction of barred galaxies is independent of
environment However this fraction of barred galaxies appears to decline rapidly
with increasing redshift

INTRODUCTION
Theories of galaxy evolution remain speculative and uncertain However strong
constraints on such theories are becoming available from the marvelous new imaging data
on galaxy morphology at various redshifts that have have become available during the
last seven years Such observations show that most star formation in galaxies with z  1
takes place in disks whereas stars in objects with z  2 occurs mainly in luminous blobs
and chaotic structures Furthermore the typical galaxy at z  2 is at any given time
undergoing a merger whereas such major mergers are seen to be relatively rare at z  1
Additionally late-type galaxies are seen to change their appearance rapidly with increasing
redshift whereas the morphological evolution of early-type galaxies seems to be much
 3 
slower Unexpectedly the fraction of barred galaxies is observed to be a steeply decreasing
function of redshift while the fraction of nearby barred galaxies is found to be almost
independent of their environment
2 BARRED GALAXIES
Some time ago van den Bergh et al 1996 noticed that barred galaxies appeared to
be much rarer in the Hubble Deep Field than they are in nearby regions of the Universe
Making detailed corrections for band-shift eects changes in resolution and the increase
of noise in observations of more distant galaxies van den Bergh et al 2002 were able to
conrm the reality of this eect As viewed in rest frame blue light the fraction of barred
galaxies appears to decrease from 23 at z  00 to  4 at z  07 Possibly this decrease
in the fraction of barred galaxies with increasing redshift is due to the fact that young
recently formed spiral galaxies are still too chaotic dynamically hot to undergo global
bar-like instabilities Another unexpected eect see Table 1 is that the frequency of of
bars in disk S0-Im galaxies appears to be almost independent of galaxy environment van
den Bergh 2002 and work in preparation
Among 1103 nearby disk galaxies that have been observed with large reecting
telescopes Sandage  Tammann 1981 it is found that 26  2 are barred This value
does not appear to dier signicantly from 32  5 barred objects among 107 Coma S0-Sc
galaxies with m  170 Since the fraction of barred objects depends slightly on Hubble
type it is perhaps fairest to compare the fraction of barred galaxies of types S0  S0a
in the entire Shapley-Ames catalog directly with the corresponding fraction in the Coma
cluster For the entire Shapley-Ames catalog 25  4 of 190 S0  S0a galaxies are barred
compared to 24  6 of 625 such objects among galaxies with m  170 in the Coma
cluster This result suggests that that the process that results in the formation of galactic
bars is an internal one that is almost independent of galaxy environment

3 PECULIAR GALAXIES
A galaxy is dened as being peculiar if it diers in some signicant way from the
prototypes used to dene the Hubble tuning fork classication system It is one of the
beauties of Hubbles system that most luminous nearby galaxies t it so well and do not
need to be shoehorned into the system One of the most striking results obtained from
the imaging of the Hubble Deep Field Ferguson Dickinson  Williams 2000 was that
such a large fraction of the HDFN galaxies had peculiar morphologies From my own
classications I nd that the overall fraction of peculiar galaxies as viewed in the restframe
blue band increases from 12 at z  00 to 46 at z  07 However these overall gures
are a bit misleading because of the dierence that is observed between the way in which
early-type and late-type galaxies age At z  07 only 5 of E-S0-Sa galaxies appear to
be peculiar For comparison 69 of Sbc-Sc galaxies are peculiar at z  07 Taken at face
value this result suggests that late-type galaxies have required a longer time arrive at their
present morphology than have systems of early type Also the nature of the peculiarities
seen in early-type galaxies are systematically dierent from those that are observed in
late-type systems In distant Sa-Sb spirals the arm structure is generally less well-developed
than it is among nearby spirals with z  0 On the other hand the peculiarity of late-type
spirals at high redshifts is mainly due to the fact that their spiral structure is more chaotic
than it is for nearby Sbc and Sc galaxies A special kind of peculiarity occurs among spirals
that are located in dense cluster environments van den Bergh 1976 As a result of what is
nowadays referred to as galaxy harassment Moore et al 1996 the spiral arms of tidally
interacting early-type galaxies and galaxies in rich clusters have a fuzzy appearance In
extreme cases the spiral structure becomes anemic On the other hand the spiral arms
 5 
of late-type interacting spirals take on a knotty morphology which is presumably due to
an enhanced formation rate of clusters and associations
4 THE MADAU PLOT
Perhaps the most striking feature of galaxy morphology and star formation is that
most stars at z  1 appear to be forming in disks On the other hand the majority of stars
in objects with z  2 seem to form in luminous clumps or in chaotic structures Possibly
the change in slope of the Madau 1997 plot near z  15 is due to this transition from
chaoticclumpy star formation at high redshifts to star creation in disks among the majority
of nearby galaxies
5 MERGERS
On deep exposures with the HST the surface density of galaxies is high As a result
many galaxies are members of optical ie nonphysical pairs One can try to circumvent
this problem by only accepting those objects which either 1 exhibit tidal distortions or
2 galaxies with physically overlapping main bodies as merger candidates Adopting this
denition it is found that only 5 of the galaxies in the HDFN HDFS that have
z  12 are merger candidates On the other hand it turns out that 57 of the objects
with z  20 are merger candidates In other words most galaxies at z  2 are at any given
time involved in a merger with a luminous massive companion whereas nearby galaxies
are typically single It is noted in passing that only 15 of the galaxies with m  170 in
the Coma cluster appear to be merging or have double or multiple cores Presumably this
low merger frequency is a direct consequence of the very high 1038  60 kms Colless 
Dunn 1996 velocity dispersion in the Coma cluster

6 CONCLUSIONS
Perhaps the most important insight that has been obtained in recent times is that
galaxy morphology depends strongly on both the environment and on the redshifts of
galaxies The Hubble tuning fork classication system is strictly applicable only to nearby
galaxies with z  05 with bars apparently becoming ever less frequent with increasing
redshift Furthermore The Hubble system becomes degenerate in very dense environments
where the majority of galaxies are of Hubble types E S0 and SB0
