Abstract Bacteriophages phages for short are viruses of bacteria The majority
of phages contain a double-stranded DNA genome packaged in a capsid at a density of
 500 mgml This high density requires substantial compression of the normal B form
helix leading to the conjecture that DNA in mature phage virions is under signicant
pressure and that pressure is used to eject the DNA during infection A large number
of theoretical computer simulation and in vitro experimental studies surrounding this
conjecture has revealed many  though often isolated andor contradictory  aspects
of packaged DNA This prompts us to present a unied view of the statistical physics
and thermodynamics of DNA packaged in phage capsids We argue that the DNA
in a mature phage is in a metastable state wherein electrostatic self-repulsion is
balanced by curvature stress due to connement in the capsid We show that in
addition to the osmotic pressure associated with the packaged DNA and its counterions
there are four dierent pressures within the capsid pressure on the DNA hydrostatic
pressure the pressure experienced by the capsid and the pressure associated with the
chemical potential of DNA ejection Signicantly we analyze the mechanism of force
transmission in the packaged DNA and demonstrate that the pressure on DNA is
not important for ejection We derive equations showing a strong hydrostatic pressure
dierence across the capsid shell We propose that when a phage is triggered to eject by
interaction with its receptor in vitro the thermodynamic incentive of water molecules
to enter the phage capsid ushes the DNA out of the capsid In vivo the dierence
between the osmotic pressures in the bacterial cell cytoplasm and the culture medium
similarly results in a water ow that drags the DNA out of the capsid and into the
bacterial cell
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
1 Introduction
Bacteriophages or phages are viruses of bacteria Phages consist of a protein capsid
that encapsidates their genome and a tail  a hollow tube connected to the capsid
via a portal complex During infection the phage tail attaches to a host bacterium
punctures the cytoplasmic membrane and its genome translocates through the portal
and the tail into the bacterial cytoplasm Infection initiates the phage life-cycle within
the bacterial cytoplasm the genome is transcribed and replicated phage proteins are
synthesized and new genome copies are packaged into newly assembled capsids The
cycle ends with lysis of the host cell and the release of multiple progeny Understanding
the mechanisms of phage genome ejection is important not only in the insights it
provides on DNA structure but also to provide a model for how eukaryotic viruses may
release their nucleic acid in to the cytoplasm or nucleus of an infected cell
The genome of a mature phage virion is usually a B-form double-stranded DNA
dsDNA A common phage may have 35-50 kb DNA DNA and genome will be used
interchangeably packed into a capsid of  60 nm diameter ie the phage DNA is
packaged tightly within the capsid in a condensed state at a linear compression factor
 250 or at a density  500 mgml 114 20 21 More than ve decades ago this
compression led to the conjecture henceforth referred to as the pressure-conjecture
that DNA in a mature phage capsid is under signicant pressure and is kept in place
by means of a plug proteins in the tail tube When the plug is opened by the
action of the appropriate receptor the pressure of the DNA causes its release into the
cytoplasm of an infected cell in a biologically passive manner 2225 The diculty of
obtaining experimental kinetic data for the ejection of any phage genome into an infected
cell resulted in the conjecture becoming fact The few published examples that were
inconsistent with the theory elicited little response and most textbooks simply refer to
the DNA injection step without further elaboration However at the beginning of this
millennium the pressure conjecture resurfaced in the biophysics community A single
molecule study reported that the packaging motor of phage 29 is capable of packaging
DNA into a phage capsid against a force of magnitude  60 pN 26 The force which
was assumed to be totally conserved and thus available for the subsequent ejection step
and which therefore can be termed as the ejection force was simply dened as the
pressure on the DNA within the capsid multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the unit
cell corresponding to the hexagonal lattice arrangement of the packaged DNA It was
estimated that the pressure on the packaged DNA as well as the pressure on the inside
of the capsid is in the order of 60 atm for a mature phage virion This work was quickly
followed by a large number of computer simulations 2730 theoretical analyses 3135
and in vitro experimental studies 3641 4448 surrounding the pressure-conjecture a
signicant fraction of these studies stating the 60 atm pressure on the packaged DNA
for a mature virion as a matter of fact
Many recent theoretical computer simulation and in vitro experimental studies
have been principally directed to quantify how the pressure on the DNA can be
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
understood from a thermodynamic perspective However to the best of our knowledge
the issue of the mechanical transmission of the pressure along the packaged DNA helix
has received no attention Putting aside that question for the moment a general
consensus has been reached on a thermodynamic description of the pressure on the
DNA DNA is a charged polymer with persistence length  50 nm DNA conned
inside a capsid of diameter  50 nm has a large free energy cost F  relative to the
state of the DNA outside the capsid The pressure on the packaged DNA can be
thermodynamically derived from this free energy However fundamental disagreements
remain between dierent theories on the thermodynamic origin of the pressure acting on
the packaged DNA In light of these disagreements together with the question of how
mechanical transmission of force along a exible polymer naturally raises the question
Does the pressure-conjecture necessitate a biologically passive ejection force
In order to appreciate the outstanding issues more easily we provide a brief overview
of the structure of packaged phage DNA and existing approaches to describe phage DNA
packaging and ejection
11 Structure of the packaged DNA in mature phage virions
Experiments on the structure of the packaged DNA within phage capsids have a long
history preliminary evidence of hexagonal packaging of the DNA for T2 and T7 phages
was rst obtained in 1961 1 and X-ray diraction was also used to establish that DNA
forms concentric layers within the capsid 24 Several theoretical models have been
proposed for the topology of the packaged DNA wound into a spool 4951 a liquid
crystal with hairpins 52 53 or defects 54 to name but a few subjecting the topic
to much debate The rst unambiguous high-quality images of DNA organization in
mature phage capsids were obtained using cryo-electron microscopy in 1997 Averaged
over many mature T7 tail-deletion mutant virions viewed along the portal axis the
packaged DNA showed patterns of circular striations spaced  25 nm apart Fig
1 4 A computer-modeled projection side views of spooled DNA within the capsid
again averaged over many virions strongly suggested that T7 DNA is wrapped axially
in concentric shells of a toroid In each shell DNA is coiled with an axial rise of  25
nm per turn and the diameter of each turn is imposed by the previous shell Following
this pioneering study a succession of cryo-electron microscopy reconstructions have
provided support for a toroidal structure  5 both isometric and prolate T4 6 7
P22 15 29 813 K1E and K1-5 14 P-SPP7 15 and N4 20 all reveal consecutive
layers of toroidal DNA spaced by  25 nm Together these observations suggest that
when averaged over many virions the well-dened hexagonal lattice for the packaged
DNA may be a generic feature of all phages Fig 2 Separately it should be noted
that where it was resolved in these reconstructions the leading end rst end to enter
the infected cell is seen to extend into the narrow portal channel Furthermore in
earlier studies the leading end of the genome could be cross-linked to the tail of several
mature phage virions 1619 Portaltail insertion of the leading DNA end during virion

morphogenesis is also likely a general feature as it ensures that the subsequent DNA
ejection step is ecient

It is of paramount importance to emphasize that the hexagonal toroidal spool
structure of the packaged DNA is an average property This point is illustrated
beautifully in a recent paper on phage T5 55 Further to be packed within a capsid
the DNA helix has to cross itself and therefore cannot lie on a perfect lattice The
toroidal structure has also been suggested to hold only for the part of the DNA close to
the inner wall of the capsid and not for the entire DNA eg Refs 21 29

12 Existing approaches for the thermodynamics of packaging and ejection forces
There have been two main  and mutually conicting  approaches that address
the thermodynamic origin of packaging and ejection forces continuum mechanics and
coarse-grained molecular mechanics models In the continuum mechanics model 3135

 Similarly the bending energy U b
packaged DNA is seen as a uniformly charged rod with a certain persistent length lp
organized in a toroidal spool on a hexagonal lattice Fig 2 The continuum mechanics
model is simple enough to allow analytical calculations packaged DNA is assumed to
repulsively self-interact with electrostatic Coulomb interaction allowing calculation of
the stored electrostatic energy U el
is obtained from
the toroidal spool arrangement of DNA on a hexagonal lattice Both the electrostatic
and bending energies are assumed to be zero for free DNA outside the capsid Thereafter
with the assumption that the dierence between the entropy of free and packaged DNA
is negligible the dierence between the Helmholtz free energy of packaged and free DNA
is obtained as F  U el
p  Note that in a given buered solution and a capsid of
volume V  made of a perfectly rigid material F is only a function of the length L of the
DNA within the capsid ie F  F L In particular F increases as a function of L
and it is FADNAL the pressure associated with the chemical potential of DNA
ejection the chemical potential of DNA ejection is simply dened as the negative rate
of change of the free energy F with respect to the length of DNA within the capsid
that manifests as the ejection pressure where ADNA is the cross sectional area of the
DNA Note that FL has the units of force consequently in the continuum mechanics
model FL is viewed as the ejection force and FL as the packaging force note
that FL is also the chemical potential of DNA ejection as dened above
In the in vitro  experiments 3639 phage virions are immersed in a solution
containing PEG andor DNA condensing agents and DNA is ejected when triggered by
the LamB receptor protein The length of the DNA that remains within the capsid at
the end of the ejection process depends on the concentration of the PEG andor DNA
condensing agent
The basic principles underlying these in vitro experiments were
rst presented in a theoretical paper more than four decades ago 25 The continuum
mechanics model has been widely advertised to explain the in vitro ejection data not
just for  but for all phages  both in vitro and in vivo A somewhat deeper look
however reveals that the agreement between theory and the in vitro experiments using
T5 one of only three phages studied in osmotic suppression experiments remains
poor 4041 The model also neglects how the ejection of proteins from infecting virions
which is a feature of most phages into the cell is accomplished and it cannot therefore
describe the complete infection process Further there is also disagreement between the
continuum mechanics theory and the experimental kinetics of T7 DNA translocation
into the bacterial cytoplasm in vivo 56 57 All but the leading 05 kb of the 70 kb
genome of the unrelated phage N4 is also known to be internalized by transcription
in the cell 20 42 and marker rescue experiments with phage SP82 suggest that the
phage genome enters a cell at a constant rate 43 None of the in vivo experiments
that show kinetics of genome internalization are consistent with theories derived from
in vitro ejection studies
The continuum mechanics model suers from fundamentally unrealistic assump-
tions that diminish its value In particular free energy is an equilibrium concept ob-
taining an ejection pressure by FADNAL in order to explain the experimental
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
data on the irreversible ejection process has the underlying assumption that DNA re-
mains at equilibrium in a toroidal spool conguration on a hexagonal lattice at all stages
of ejection Not only is this assumption unsubstantiated by polymer physics theory it
is also inconsistent with actual experimental data on T5 55 the latter is illustrated in
Fig 3 below In order to circumvent some of these problems the continuum mechanics
model invokes two free parameters to t experimental data
Figure 3 Cryo-EM images of a single T5 virion at dierent stages of ejection a
full capsid to h empty capsid showing the lack of toroidal spool conguration of the
DNA hexagonal lattice at all stages of ejection in contrast to the assumption made by

In coarse-grained molecular mechanics models 2730 DNA is modeled as a
polymer with a persistence length lp and polymer dynamics is allowed to take its
own course in simulations of phage genome packaging and ejection The model does
not allow analytical calculations  it is eected only by computer simulations and
in work published to date the DNA is modeled without surrounding water and
counterions However there is no assumption that DNA remains at equilibrium in
a toroidal spool conguration on a hexagonal lattice during packaging or ejection The
main limitation of coarse-grained molecular mechanics model is that because processes
are only materialized by computer simulation they are dicult to correlate with
experimental data
13 This paper
In summary our understanding of the thermodynamics of phage DNA packaging and
ejection provided by the existing literature is far from satisfactory
In this paper
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
we present a comprehensive treatise of the thermodynamics of packaged DNA and the
mechanism of genome ejection independent of any specic model In Sec 2 we show
that there are four distinct pressures within the capsid pressure on DNA hydrostatic
pressure pressure experienced by the capsid and pressure associated with the chemical
potential of DNA ejection These are all dierent thermodynamic quantities We
also show that for amature phage the hydrostatic pressure within the capsid is much
higher than outside and that the pressure on the DNA is a lot smaller than commonly
envisaged In Sec 3 we take up the issue of force transmission along the DNA helix
and show that the pressure on DNA is not important for genome ejection Instead in
Sec 4 we suggest that when a phage is triggered in vitro to eject by interaction with its
receptor the thermodynamic incentive for water to enter the capsid ushes the DNA
out We argue that in vivo the dierence between the osmotic pressure within the cell
cytoplasm and the outside culture medium initiates and importantly maintains a ow
of water from the culture medium into the capsid and then from the capsid down the
phage tail-tube into the bacterial cell cytoplasm dragging the DNA out of the capsid
and into the cell We show that this theory is consistent with both studies of in vitro
ejection and observations of infection in vivo
2 Thermodynamics of phages in vitro
21 Entropy of DNA ejection in vitro
We consider an experiment with an ensemble of realizations each containing a phage
capsid initially placed in a certain buer solution for each realization a DNA of length
L is packaged within a capsid whose volume we denote by V  The DNA is allowed to
exit the phage in vitro and at the end of the experiment the entire genome ends up in
the buer The experimental system is kept at a temperature T at all times The only
interaction of the system with the environment is to exchange thermal energy For the
system in its entirety we dene the initial DNA within the capsid free-energy Fp and
the entropy Sp the nal DNA in the buer free-energy Funp and entropy Sunp The
quantities Fejection  Funp  Fp and Sejection  Sunp  Sp are then the free energy and
entropy of ejection respectively
The above isothermal experiment when actually performed in a laboratory is
exothermic 58 Earlier experiments using dierential scanning calorimetry led to the
same conclusion 5961
ie the system releases an amount of heat of magnitude
Qejection to the environment This tells us that Sejection  0 however the amount of heat
released to the environment cannot give us the value Sejection because the ejection process
is spontaneous and irreversible All we can say using the second law of thermodynamics
is that Sejection  QejectionT 
The result that the entropy of ejection is negative from the point of view of DNA
connement in the capsid is counter-intuitive One would expect the congurational
entropy of the DNA to be strongly reduced due to connement when compared to the
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
same DNA in solution in other words from the conguration entropy of the DNA
in isolation one would expect Sejection  0 This is in fact correct however the DNA
cannot be considered in isolation The congurational entropy of the DNA is only a very
small part of the entropy of the entire system most of the change in entropy associated
with ejection of DNA from its conned state within the capsid into the environment
involves the ordering of water molecules around the free DNA 62 DNA being a
charged molecule orders the dipole orientation of nearby water molecules There are
many fewer water molecules surrounding the DNA inside the capsid when compared
to the same DNA in solution Consequently although the DNA molecule does gain
entropy following ejection from the capsid so many more water molecules lose entropy
that the entropy of the entire system decreases as DNA is ejected from the capsid
This issue can be used to evaluate the current approaches for analyzing the physics
of phage ejection DNA congurational entropy is not considered a signicant parameter
in the continuum mechanics model while molecular mechanics models 2730 show
that the congurational entropy constitutes a sizable fraction of the free energy of the
packaged DNA
22 Thermodynamics for the capsid content of a mature phage in a buer solution
Most phage capsid shells are fully permeable to water and small ions or molecules but
are impermeable to large molecules in the buer or to the encapsidated DNA Some
phage capsids like those of T4 and its relatives are much less permeable even to small
molecules or ions including cesium chloride and ammonium acetate Such capsids can
easily be broken by osmotic shock a phenomenon that resulted in the classic electron
micrograph showing phage T2 DNA outside a ruptured virion 63
We assume that the entire system with DNA packaged within the capsid can
be thermodynamically separated into two subsystems separated by the capsid shell
The subsystem within the capsid consists of DNA perhaps in addition to protein
molecules which we will not specically refer to further and an aqueous environment
containing small solutes including ions that can permeate the capsid shell while the
subsystem outside usually consists of water and solute molecules that can or cannot
permeate the capsid shell Apart from exchanges of solutes that can permeate the
capsid shell these two subsystems do not interact This assumption allows us to express
Fp  Fpin Fpout where Fpin and Fpout are respectively the free energy of the contents
of the capsid and that of the environment outside the capsid Clearly Fpin is a function
of the equilibrium capsid volume V  DNA length L number of water molecules nwin
and the number of solute molecules of all species nsin within the capsid Similarly
Fpout is a function of number of water molecules nwout and the number of solute
molecules of all species nsout in the solution Both subsystems are open in the
thermodynamic sense since they exchange water and small solute molecules We assume
realistically that the volume of the buer in which the phage is immersed is  V  so for
analyzing the thermodynamics of the phage and its contents the external solution can
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
be considered to be an innite reservoir for water and small permeable solute molecules
The number of solute molecules within the phage capsid nsin is then xed by the
chemical potential of the small solute molecules in the buer collectively denoted by
s for the case of counterions via the Donnan equilibrium This simply means
that Fpin  FpinV Ls The free energy FpinV Ls can be further dissociated
into the interaction free energy F intV Ls of the ions DNA and water molecules
within the capsid and the DNA congurational free energy this includes bending or
curvature energy and the congurational entropy of the DNA FcV Ls of the DNA
is then given by
FpinV Ls  F int
V Ls  FcV Ls
We also assume that water is incompressible and that small solutes do not occupy any
physical volume With these assumptions in equilibrium the number of water molecules
within the capsid is then determined by V minus the physical volume of the DNA and
we can now explicitly focus on a number of thermodynamic issues
221 Pressure associated with the chemical potential for DNA ejection If we assume
that the capsid is made of a perfectly rigid material then from the above denitions
FpinV Ls  FpinLs we can dene the pressure associated with the chemical
potential for DNA ejection Consider two situations using the same buer conditions
ie at xed chemical potentials of permeable ions one where DNA of length L and
the other a length of L  dL is packaged within the capsid We assume that Donnan
equilibrium conditions are satised for both lengths of DNA within the phage capsid
One can then dene the pressure associated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection
by comparing the free energy of the capsid content under these two situations viz
FpinLs and FpinL  dLs as
FpinLs
Pejection  
where ADNA is the cross-sectional area of the DNA The pressure Pejection is the pressure
that the plug at the end of the tail tube feels from within the phage
23 Pressure on the capsid from within hydrostatic pressure imbalance across the
capsid and pressure on the DNA
In Sec 22 we considered the thermodynamics of the capsid content as a subsystem
under a xed chemical potential of permeable small solute molecules in the buer while
assuming that the number of water molecules within the capsid is simply determined by
the capsid volume This is however an incomplete description of the thermodynamics
of the entire system namely the phage immersed in the buer solution as we did
not consider the thermodynamic penalties associated with exchange of water molecules
across the capsid shell
If the capsid is made of a perfectly rigid material without
the possibility of expansion or contraction such a description would be correct but in
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
reality the capsid is comprised of protein molecules and therefore has a nite albeit
high rigidity 65 Keeping the assumption that water is incompressible rather than
a xed capsid volume determining the number of water molecules internalized the
capsid volume should actually be determined by the thermodynamics of water molecule
exchange across the capsid shell which is equivalent to a semi-permeable membrane
We now argue that for a given length L of the DNA within the capsid the
equilibrium volume V is determined by the buer composition We presuppose that
an expansioncontraction of the capsid allows for an exchange of a small number of
water molecules relative to the total number of water molecules present in the external
buer We can then safely assume that the chemical potential of permeable small solutes
in the buer remains unaltered by the exchange of water molecules across the capsid
First the pressure on the capsid from within Pcapsid can be calculated from the
V -dependence of the free energy FpinV Ls as follows Imagine a virtual uniform
expansion of the capsid leading to a volume increase from V to V dV the extra volume
will be lled by water from the buer and permeable solute molecules as dictated by
s  for the case of ions via the Donnan equilibrium For a given length of DNA
under xed s this leads to a new value of the free energy of the inside material of
the capsid FpinV  dV Ls but also since the buer solution loses a volume dV of
water the free energy of the buer solution increases by an amount outdV  where out
is the osmotic pressure of the buer solution The pressure on the capsid from within
is therefore given by
Pcapsid  
FpinV Ls
 out
Secondly waters thermodynamic incentive to enter the capsid is given by the
osmotic gradient across the capsid shell namely in  out where in is the osmotic
pressure within the capsid shell and is dened by see Eq 1
in  
F int
V Ls
Simultaneously when entering the capsid the water molecules exit a zone of hydrostatic
pressure Phydroout the hydrostatic pressure in the solution outside the capsid and enter
the capsid which may have in principle a dierent pressure Phydroin The equilibrium
capsid volume is then determined by the condition that in  out is counter-balanced
by the pressure-volume work done by water molecules in entering the capsid
Phydroin  Phydroout  in  out
It is interesting to note that Eq 5 is well-known to hold for bacterial and plant cells
the osmotic pressure gradient is counter-balanced by a hydrostatic pressure dierential
turgor 68 Turgor allows cells to enlarge and thus facilitates growth
Further an appreciation for Eq
5 is aorded by a straightforward gedanken
experiment that connects to elementary physical chemistry Consider a vertical U-
tube with a membrane at the lowest point separating the two arms The membrane is
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
permeable to water but impermeable to say sugar molecules We ll up the two arms
of the U-tube to equal height the left arm with pure water and the right arm with
sugar solution As time progresses water from the left arm will permeate into the right
arm reducing the height of the water column on the left while increasing the height
of the sugar solution column on the right At equilibrium the height of water in the
left column will be lower than the sugar solution meaning that there is a hydrostatic
pressure dierence P across the membrane Moreover at equilibrium the concentration
of sugar in the right column is non-zero while it remains zero in the left column by
construction There is therefore an osmotic gradient across the membrane which is
precisely counter-balanced by the hydrostatic pressure P  Equation 5 describes the
same equilibrium where the dierence between the osmotic pressures inside and outside
the capsid is counter-balanced by the hydrostatic pressure dierence across its protein
Equations 3 and 5 allow us to appreciate not only how the pressure on the capsid
of nite rigidity is mechanically materialized but also how the pressure PDNA that the
capsid mechanically transmits to the DNA and by action-reaction the pressure the
DNA transmits to the capsid First the force balance on a small capsid surface tells
us that the capsid pressure Pcapsid equals the hydrostatic pressure gradient across the
capsid plus the pressure that is mechanically transmitted to the DNA inside ie
Pcapsid  Phydroin  Phydroout  PDNA
Incorporating Eqs 1 and 4-6 this reads
PDNA  
FpinV LsL
 in  
FcV Ls
Note in Eq 7 that the osmotic pressure within the capsid in is derived from the
interaction energy of the ions DNA and water molecules within the capsid while the
same interaction energy appears in FpinV Ls but with opposite sign Eq 4
Consequently the net contribution of this interaction energy to the rhs of Eq 7 is
zero This conclusion implies that the pressure on the DNA mechanically transmitted
by the capsid comes entirely from the stiness of the DNA We verify this conclusion
in Sec 3 for a single turn of the DNA Therein we also discuss why Eq 7 is not in
conict with the experiment by Smith et al 26
It is straightforward to show that Eqs 3-7 are consistent with the Gibbs free
energy minimization of the entire system the mature phage plus the buer solution
Moreover we note that due to the cancellation of the interaction energy term in Eq 7
as explained above the compressive forces on the DNA mechanically transmitted by the
capsid are small compared to Pcapsid the bulk of Pcapsid is mechanically transmitted to
the water inside This is in fact conrmed from the structural and interaction properties
of both the packaged DNA and the structure of the protein molecules comprising the
capsid shell Raman spectral studies of mature P22 and T7 phages have not found any
evidence of any structural alteration of protein or DNA that would be expected if they
were subjected to high pressure 66 67 Only the conguration of the phosphodiester
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
groups in packaged DNA are perturbed from that found in free DNA solutions and the
capsid protein structures of mature virions are indistinguishable from empty DNA-free
particles
Finally we note from Eqs 2-7 that the osmotic pressure in within the capsid
the pressure Pejection associated with the chemical potential of DNA ejection and the
pressure PDNA imparted by the capsid on the DNA are entirely dierent thermodynamic
quantities Importantly it must be appreciated that these pressures are all equilibrium
quantities and they cannot be used to describe a non-equilibrium situation
3 Can PDNA and Pejection play any role in DNA ejection dynamics
In this section we investigate whether PDNA and Pejection play a role in DNA ejection
We rst discuss the case of PDNA within the context of the continuum mechanics model
in order to do so we start by analyzing the stability of the DNA within a phage capsid
31 Stability of the DNA within a phage capsid
As described in Secs 12 continuum mechanics model starts with the assumption that
the DNA within a capsid made of a perfectly rigid material takes a toroidal spool
conguration on a hexagonal lattice at all stages of ejection Given that the outer
radius of the spool is xed by the capsid dimensions all structural aspects of the spool
are then determined by the spacing of the hexagonal lattice Phages with internal cores
constitute a special case the radius of the innermost ring of the spool is simply given
by the radius of the core For a given ionic condition nsin inside the capsid  which
in turn is xed by the chemical potential s of the small solutes in the external buer
for the case of counterions via the Donnan equilibrium  and DNA of length L within
a capsid of volume V  the free energy of the material inside the capsid is a function of
aH alone where aH is the hexagonal lattice spacing ie FpinV Ls  F aHs
Note that the congurational entropy of the DNA is not a meaningful quantity in the
continuum mechanics model hence in this section Fc only contains curvature bending
energy of the DNA ie FcV Ls  UcaH
Within the continuum mechanics model one can argue that aH is xed via a trade-
o between F intaHs and UcaH see Eq 1 The interaction free energy can
be lowered by increasing aH However since the volume constraint meaning that
the total available volume within the capsid is V  must be obeyed increasing aH will
reduce the minimum radius of the DNA spool because within the inner part of the
spool the DNA will be much more tightly bent which will increase its bending energy
In this manner a reduction in interaction free energy increases curvature energy and
vice versa In other words the trade-o between these two quantities dictates that
F intaHs
UcaH
which minimizes the free energy F aHs We denote the value of aH obtained from
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
Eq 8 by a0
H  and the corresponding minimum of the free energy of the inside content
of the capsid by F 0
If it is further assumed that most of the
interaction free energy variation due to variations in a0
H  caused by a virtual uniform
expansion of the capsid as in Eq 4 involves the DNA helix then the osmotic pressure
within the capsid can also be dened as

an internal proteinaceous core  can be found in Ref 64
32 Can PDNA transmit down the tail tube
The only way PDNA can play a role in DNA ejection is if it can transmit from within
the capsid where the bulk of the DNA is located down the tail tube To evaluate this
idea we begin with the appreciation that PDNA favors a uniform expansion of the capsid
However since DNA is not a continuum material PDNA does not trivially transmit along
the helical axis into the tail tube Nevertheless when the DNA organization within the
capsid is averaged over many phage particles the picture that emerges is that pressure
on the toroidal spool of DNA does translate into a compressive force f acting along the
contour of the DNA Following Sec 31 we start by analyzing this force within the
continuum mechanics model and we then ask whether this force can transmit down the
tail tube
pitch of the DNA toroid
Figure 4 a One full turn of the DNA toroid around the axis of the idealized toroidal
spool in Fig 2 b With the pitch ignored the corresponding DNA ring of radius
R and the compressive force f along the contour of the DNA shown on a dierential
length element l of the ring
We consider one full turn of DNA around the axis of the idealized toroidal spool
Fig 4a For simplicity we ignore the pitch of this turn ie it is idealized as a DNA
ring of radius R and we focus on a dierential length segment l The DNA ring and
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
the compressive force along the DNA contour are shown in Fig 4b The fact that
the entire DNA spool is under a pressure PDNA within the phage capsid implies that
the isolated ring itself is under a pressure P  but whose relation to PDNA we have not

Within the scheme of continuum mechanics the force balance equation for this
length segment along the transverse direction along a line joining the
dierential
dierential length element and the center of the ring is given by
f sin   f   P l t
where t is the cross-sectional diameter of the DNA Further the geometrical con-
sideration from Fig 4b tells us that
sin     lR
f  P R t
We now note that just like in Eq
8 the DNA ring stays in its conguration by
the balance of two competing thermodynamic forces one derived from its curvature
energy uc the other from the energy of self-interaction with nearby DNA strands The
thermodynamic force related to curvature energy favors an increase of the radius of the
ring while the thermodynamic force related to the self-interaction free energy favors a
decrease The magnitude of this force is given by
2R P t

the widely used value then
207  1028
Thus depending on the radius of the DNA ring the magnitude of the compressive force
f along the contour of the DNA can be a few pN Equation 15 tells us that the pressure
on this DNA ring is only in terms of the stiness of the DNA as we argued in Sec 23
How much of this force can transmit down the tail tube We should remember that
force is a vector quantity Although the above exercise shows that there is a compressive
force along the contour of the DNA ring that make up the toroidal spool it is necessary
to follow the actual turns of the DNA leading into the tail tube in order to identify how
much of the force f is actually being transmitted However the denition of persistence
length lp in polymer physics means that while a DNA molecule of length  lp is semi-
exible a DNA molecule with length  lp is simply a exible polymer It is therefore
impossible to transmit compressive forces along the contour of a DNA that is  50 nm
This consideration alone ensures that any compressive force along the contour of eg
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
an  16 m long  genome will not transmit into the tail tube Therefore compressive
forces on the packaged phage genomic DNA cannot be important for DNA ejection
Our estimate of f having a magnitude of a few pN is at rst blush in apparent
contradiction with the experiment by Smith et al 26 A deeper look however
immediately reveals that Eq 15 and the forces exerted by the packaging motor are
actually compatible Thermodynamically we have identied four dierent pressures
within the capsid pressure on the DNA PDNA hydrostatic pressure Phydroin the pressure
experienced by the capsid Pcapsid and the pressure Pejection associated with the chemical
potential of DNA ejection These are all dierent quantities Smith et al 26 measure
Pejection they assumed that the work done against Pejection by the packaging motor is
used to pressurize the DNA and is conserved in the capsid However most of the work
done against Pejection by the packaging motor is expended in increasing the osmotic
pressure within the capsid This increase is due to the expulsion of water molecules
out of the capsid  a reverse osmosis process  in order to allow the phage genome
being packaged to condense while only a small part of the work is used to increase
PDNA The energy expended during water expulsion is not conserved by the packaged
genome which explains our lower estimate of PDNA inside the capsid In this context
it is important to remember that osmotic pressure is only a measure for the chemical
potential of water the fact that the osmotic pressure inside the capsid is high does not
imply that the DNA is under enhanced pressure
33 Is Pejection important for DNA ejection dynamics
Equation 2 shows that for a mature phage in a given buer the tail plug feels
a thermodynamic pressure Pejection from inside the capsid Given that Pejection is a
thermodynamically derived quantity ie derivative of Fpin with respect to L it is
clear that if genome ejection were a quasi-equilibrium process it would indeed govern
the ejection dynamics However the underlying assumption of quasi-equilibrium is that
at all stages of ejection the DNA remaining within the phage head stays in a toroidal
loop with an ever-increasing spacing between the toroidal strands as ejection proceeds
This is the major thesis of the continuum mechanics model which uses Pejection to explain
the in vitro experimental data using phage 
Whether this thesis and its underlying assumption are correct or not lies in the
question of time scales
If the time-scales associated with the equilibration of DNA
in the form of a toroidal spool on a hexagonal lattice and the small solute molecules
within the phage capsid maintained at a xed chemical potential by the external buer
are much smaller than the ejection time equilibrium pressures and forces can be used
to describe genome ejection However recent experimental evidence with T5 clearly
demonstrates that as the DNA leaves the capsid it goes through a series of phase
transitions 55 The cryo-electron microscopic images of T5 virions during DNA ejection
strongly suggest that the process is non-equilibrium which invalidates the use of Pejection
to describe its dynamics Comparable experiments have not yet been conducted with
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
other phages but there is no justiable reason to assume that the genome of other
phages in particular those lacking a dened internal core structure whose DNA is
packaged to the same density would behave otherwise We are not aware of experimental
studies that probe the equilibration time-scales of conned DNA such as within a phage
capsid However the high velocity of phage DNA ejection measured in vitro up to 75
kbsec T5 with long pauses between distinct steps 44 and up to 60 kbsec  in 10
mM Na buer or  20 kbsec in 10 mM Mg2 45 makes it highly unlikely that these
are quasi-equilibrium processes These experimental data suggest that Pejection cannot
be used to describe DNA ejection dynamics even in vitro
4 An alternative mechanism of DNA ejection from phage virions
Sections 2 and 3 illustrate the fundamental problems with the idea that the thermo-
dynamically derived ejection pressure Pejection or the corresponding ejection force
ADNAPejection causes DNA ejection from phages There is therefore a clear need for
a mechanism that can explain the physics of DNA ejection one that is consistent with
both in vitro and in vivo experimental data We suggest such a mechanism below
41 DNA ejection in vitro
Of the two main approaches for DNA ejection continuum mechanics and coarse-grained
molecular mechanics models only the former addresses using Pejection the DNA ejection
mechanism in a way that can be compared to in vitro experimental data
In these
creative experiments phages are immersed in a solution containing PEG andor DNA
condensing agents and DNA is ejected from the virion when triggered by the receptor
protein The length of DNA that remains within the capsid at the end of the ejection
process depends on the concentration of the PEG andor DNA condensing agent
With the caveats we have discussed concerning the validity of using Pejection
to describe phage DNA ejection and remembering that Pejection also involves tted
parameters the continuum mechanics theory does provide good agreement with in
vitro genome ejection data for  and SPP1 eg Refs 3638 47 48 However the
data obtained with just two phage systems along with the physics of the continuum
mechanics model have often been extrapolated to all phages and in addition to explain
all phage DNA ejection in vivo These generalizations ignore data from the third phage
system that has been studied in vitro which provides rather dierent conclusions At
the presumed pressures internal to the largely full T5 capsid in vitro experimental data
can be tted to the continuum mechanics model but at low to moderate pressures when
approximately half or less of the genome remain in the capsid multiple populations are
found to co-exist 40 some phages have completely ejected their genomes whereas
others have ejected a varying amount of DNA that is not dependent on the external
osmotic pressure Furthermore at  2 atm external osmotic pressure most T5 virions
completely eject their DNA In contrast the same external pressure prevents ejection
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
of  40 of the  genome 37 Theories dependent on Pejection are clearly unable to
explain how all phages eject their DNA even in vitro
411 Hydrodynamic model of phage DNA ejection As discussed in Sec 33 in an in
vitro experiment when a mature phage is equilibrated in a certain buer solution the
dierence between in and the osmotic pressure out of the buer solution determines the
thermodynamic incentive for water molecules to enter the capsid Equation 5 shows
that if the phage tail is plugged this incentive is counter-balanced by a hydrostatic
pressure gradient across the capsid shell and the capsid being of high but not innite
rigidity will be slightly expanded from its relaxed state under the enhanced hydrostatic
pressure from inside We propose that it is this thermodynamic incentive of water
molecules to enter the capsid that ushes the DNA out when the tail plug is opened
by the action of the appropriate receptor We refer to this idea as the hydrodynamic
model of DNA ejection
When the tail plug is opened by the appropriate receptor eg LamB protein in
the case of  FhuA for T5 or YueB780 for SPP1 it is likely that the excess hydrostatic
pressure within the capsid is partially relieved by a transient water ow down the tail
tube and and as a result the capsid will reduce in size Although water ow down the
tail-tube will exert a hydrodynamic force that is likely to drag along the DNA one end
of which is already inserted into the tail-tube this process will not last long enough
to drag the entire genome out of the virion While a very small contraction of the
capsid is unlikely to be detected even by state-of-the-art experiments we can provide a
guesstimate for how much DNA could be dragged out by this transient water release
With a typical capsid diameter  60 nm assumed spherical let the capsid diameter
contract by 01 nm the water released is 4302005 nm3 With a typical tail tube
inner diameter  4 nm its cross-sectional area is 22 nm2 ignoring the cross-section
of the DNA within the tail tube and the length of the water column passing into the
tail-tube  430200522 nm  45 nm Assuming the DNA ows freely with
this water column down the tail in this example the DNA which occupies 25 of the
cross-sectional area of the tube can be moved 60 nm corresponding to  180 base pair
of a phage genome
Once the water pressure dierence across the capsid shell is relieved by this transient
water ow so long as the dierence between the osmotic pressure of the remaining DNA
within the capsid and out stays positive water will have a thermodynamic incentive to
move into the capsid using whichever path it can nd However since the capsid has a
nite volume any water movement into the capsid can only occur at the expense of an
equal volume of water now containing DNA as a solute being ejected through the tail
tube In other words following the initial transient water release down the tail-tube
continued water movement from the buer into the capsid up an osmotic gradient will
cause the DNA to be ejected This process will stop when the osmotic pressure of the
leftover amount of DNA in the capsid equals out The physics behind this in vitro DNA
ejection experiment omitting the transient water ow down the tail tube due to the
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
excess hydrostatic pressure is schematically shown in Fig 5
The hydrodynamic mechanism for DNA ejection commensurate with in vitro
experimental data All that is required to drive DNA ejection is an incentive for the
water molecules to enter the capsid which is decided dynamically in a non-equilibrium
manner There is no a priori assumption that phage genome ejection is a quasi-
equilibrium process and thus the model is not dependent on thermodynamic analyses

equilibrated in a certain buer solution The dierence between in the pressure on
the DNA and the osmotic pressure out of the buer solution is counter-balanced by
a hydrostatic pressure dierence across the capsid shell Eq 5 b The tail plug is
opened by the action of the receptor following any transient water release down the
tail-tube not shown water enters the phage capsid and ushes the DNA into the
buer
The dierence between the osmotic pressure of the residual DNA in the capsid and
out is controlled by two aspects i the presence of any small DNA condensing agents
that reduces the osmotic pressure of the capsid content without altering out and ii
the presence in the external buer of large solute molecules like PEG that increase out
but do not aect the inside osmotic pressure as they cannot penetrate into the capsid
Both achieve the same thermodynamic incentive dierential for water between inside
and outside the capsid and are qualitatively in agreement with in vitro DNA ejection
data 3641 4448 When the osmotic pressure of any DNA remaining in the capsid
 out such as at the end of the ejection process there will be no further ow of water
into the capsid and thus no more DNA ejection
The hydrodynamic model requires that the time-scale of water ow into the capsid
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
be suciently fast to match the time-scales for DNA ejection in vitro To this end
we refer to an experiment where a mature wild-type  capsid was locally deformed
compressed by up to 25 of its original volume with an AFM tip 65 Compression of
the capsid without it rupturing has to drive out internal water and small solutes When
the AFM tip was removed the virion capsid returned to its normal size and shape
within  4 ms This suggests that the large surface area to volume ratio of the capsid
allows copious amounts of water to diuse  a slow process relative to hydrodynamic
processes  across the capsid shell in a very short time Extrapolating these data to
yield a complete exchange of the contents of the capsid with the external buer gives
20 ms assuming that DNA moves freely this value results in a rate of phage genome
ejection in vitro at least 50 times the maximum measured to date
By itself the hydrodynamic model cannot explain either the stepwise ejection of
DNA from T5 particles or the coexistence of virions containing dierent amounts of DNA
at low external pressures A partial ad hoc solution for T5 one that is also necessary for
the Pejection model of DNA ejection is that the tail tube becomes temporarily blocked
by protein conformational changes thereby impeding water ow  and thus stopping
DNA ejection Note that water ow from the external buer into the capsid interior will
be simultaneously impeded Release of the blockage by a further conformational change
in the tail proteins then allows resumption of water ow and thus of DNA ejection
Interestingly the apparent activation energy for releasing the block in the step-wise
ejection process of T5 DNA ejection has been experimentally shown to be independent
of the amount of DNA remaining in the capsid 37 70
In summary the hydrodynamic model is fully compatible with the experimental
data for  and for SPP1 DNA ejection in vitro Like thermodynamics-based models
eg continuum mechanics or molecular dynamics the hydrodynamic model requires
an ad hoc assumption to explain the step-wise process of T5 DNA ejection However
the hydrodynamic model is not dependent on the critical assumption  used in Pejection-
based models  that the encapsidated DNA remains at equilibrium at all times during
the ejection process Furthermore as we argue below only the hydrodynamics model
explains how complete genome ejection can be achieved in the face of an opposing force
This is the situation in natural infections of bacterial cells
42 DNA ejection in vivo
Before discussing specic mechanisms of phage DNA ejection in vivo it is instructive
to consider some salient points about phage infections
421 Phage infection of bacteria Largely because of inuential textbooks and until
recently of only little experimental information it is not widely appreciated that all
phages eject proteins into the cell 6971 At a minimum the proteins comprising the
tail plug must be removed and for long-tailed phages like T4 T5 SPP1 and  the
tapemeasure protein which determines the precise length of the tail must be ejected
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
in order to allow the phage genome to pass through the tail tube Short tailed phages
may eject internal proteins into the cell to extend  at least functionally  their tail
so that it can span the infected cell envelope 57
Some phages eject many dierent protein molecules from their capsid some
necessarily before others perhaps after genome ejection To give just two examples
T7 virions ejects  75 molecules representing ve dierent protein species into the cell
prior to DNA penetration of the cell cytoplasm 72 and T4 virions eject  1000 IP
internal protein molecules into the cell 73 Clearly any model purporting to explain
even dsDNA phage genome ejection in vivo must also accommodate ejection of virion
proteins
Phage virions can also eject more than one DNA molecule 74 75 However as the
diameter of the channel through the portal complex and tail tube inner diameter  40
A cannot accommodate more than a single DNA helix the leading end of the second
and perhaps subsequent molecules must nd the exit channel without a built-in guiding
vectorial force Genome ejection by single-stranded DNA ssDNA or RNA viruses
whose nucleic acid is packaged at much lower densities than dsDNA phages should also
be explained by models describing phage DNA ejection Packaged genomes of these
phages are not thought to be under pressure and their mode of genome ejection has
therefore not been considered by continuum mechanics or molecular mechanics models
The E coli cytoplasm has a positive osmotic pressure of several atm above the
environment under various growth conditions the pressure has been estimated to vary
between 2 and 15 atm with 35-5 atm being commonly accepted values 76 77 This
osmotic pressure gradient is counter-balanced by a hydrostatic pressure dierential
turgor 68 that enables the cell to enlarge during growth 78 Gram-positive cells
such as Bacillus subtilis the host for phage SPP1 have much higher turgor  19
atm 79 If turgor is assumed to provide an opposing force to phage genome ejection
into the cytoplasm then a Pejection-based mechanism cannot possibly explain complete
genome ejection into cells This problem was recognized in the rst osmotic suppression
of genome ejection experiments in vitro 38 but has often been ignored in subsequent
general statements about how phages infect cells in vivo
Interestingly the osmotic
pressure of the cytoplasm declines as bacteria enter stationary phase which should allow
better genome penetration by a Pejection-based ejection mechanism However stationary
phase bacteria are not readily infected by most phages 94 which infect exponentially
growing cells with their higher turgor pressure much more eciently
A bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer that is
impermeable to most molecules other than water and glycerol An electrical potential
is maintained across this membrane A strong osmotic gradient also exists between
the external medium and the cell cytoplasm The higher internal pressure turgor is
necessary for bacteria to enlarge and undergo cell division In addition at all times a
K concentration gradient K with K high inside is maintained in cells a reverse
gradient of Na concentration also usually exists These conditions are perturbed when
a bacterium is infected by a phage as a direct connection between the cytoplasm and
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
the external medium is opened This connection passes through the phage capsid and
tail and if it is open and as we have argued water will ow from the external medium
into the cell to neutralize the overall osmotic gradient Simultaneously K will ow
from the cytoplasm into the external medium Furthermore the membrane potential
can no longer be maintained
Advocates of Pejection-based genome ejection in vivo have made various ad hoc
suggestions to explain how an entire phage genome can enter the cell cytoplasm
including the involvement of cytoplasmic non-sequence-specic DNA-binding proteins
or condensation of the phage DNA in the crowded cell cytoplasm There is however no
direct experimental support for any of these ideas Condensing the entering phage
genome in the bacterial cytoplasm would eectively prevent its transcription but
ecient  and immediate  gene expression is precisely the primary strategy of
phage infections Furthermore with the specic exception of second-step transfer of
T5 DNA it is hard to imagine how entering phage DNA could eectively compete
with the 100-fold higher DNA concentration of the bacterial chromosome for those
proteins in order to complete genome internalization in a kinetically reasonable time
frame T5 second-step transfer requires the prior synthesis of two T5-encoded DNA-
binding proteins and early T5-encoded nucleases completely degrade the bacterial
chromosome 80 thereby removing competitor DNA Nevertheless sequence-specic
DNA-binding proteins which have no or fewer binding sites on bulk chromosomal DNA
and can therefore eectively bind to incoming phage DNA in vivo have been shown to
catalyze genome internalization of phage T7 and its relatives 69 and also of N4 20
422 The hydrodynamics model is consistent with the physiology of phage infection
DNA ejection in vivo and in vitro are actually quite dierent The major distinction
is that when the tail is unplugged in vitro the environment at the distal end of the
tail tube is the same buer that surrounds the capsid In contrast during a natural
infection the distal end of the tail tube is in the cytoplasm of the infected cell while the
environment of the capsid is the growth medium Consequently the osmotic pressure
of the medium that surrounds the phage capsid is dierent from that at the opening of
the tail tip
We denote the osmotic pressure of the culture medium by out and that of the
cytoplasm of the infected cell by cyt note that cyt  out as the bacteria need to
maintain positive turgor in order to grow 77 Although in Pejection-based model of
phage genome ejection turgor is assumed to provide a resisting force against Pejection
it is the bacterial Achilles heel that actually promotes complete genome ejection by
a hydrodynamics mechanism When the tail plug is removed by interaction with its
receptor water will ow up the osmotic gradient  one that exists between the growth
medium and the cell cytoplasm  from the growth medium through the capsid shell
and tail tube into the cell cytoplasm This directional water ow can drag the DNA
into the infected cell This mechanism is schematically shown in Fig 6 It should be
noted that bacterial cells respond immediately to changes in cyt and they will always
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
maintain some turgor even during phage infection
When bacteria enter stationary phase their turgor pressure drops considerably
This reduces the osmotic gradient between the external medium and the cytoplasm in
turn this reduces the strength of water ow from the culture medium into the cytoplasm
This may explain why bacteria in stationary phase are not easily infected by most
phages Notably T7 is an exception infecting stationary and starved cells at normal
eciency 94 even though subsequent phage development may be compromised by a
lack of biosynthetic capacity in the cell

is breached Water and small solutes enter the phage capsid from the culture medium
and drains through the tail tube into the cytoplasm of the infected cell dragging the
DNA along with it
Following infection by all but one of the phages we are aware of that have been
tested there is a transient drop in membrane potential and a transient release of intra-
cytoplasmic ions into the external medium 81 82 Both occur during the period that
DNA is thought to be ejected from the virion into the cell cytoplasm
In order to
evaluate the role of the membrane potential during T4 infection an extensive series
of electrochemical studies that monitored ion uxes were conducted Reviewed in
Refs 83 84 Experiments were often combined with infective center assays after
Hershey-Chase blending of phage-cell complexes allowing estimates of 103-104 bpsec
for the rate of T4 genome internalization in vivo 818385 Furthermore T5 releases its
DNA in two distinct steps 80 During each step cytoplasmic K leaks into the external
medium while during the pause between the steps no leakage occurs 86 Thus ion
leakage is associated with phage DNA ejection and if ions are leaking out water should
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
be owing from the external medium through the phage virion into the cell cytoplasm
to reduce the osmotic gradient This is exactly what is expected if hydrodynamic forces
are dragging the phage genome into the cell
There are conicting published data on membrane depolarization and ion leakage
for phage T7 but it is now clear that T7 infection does not result in either phenomenon
87 88 indicating that no open channel that could allow water ow exists between
the environment and the infected cell cytoplasm These are signicant observations
because unlike other phages the internalization of T7 and related phage genomes is
entirely catalyzed by molecular motors These motors are enzymes that utilize cellular
energy to transport the entire genome into the cell each functioning at a constant rate
regardless of how much DNA remains in the phage head 568993 Thus in the absence
of hydrodynamic forces energy-requiring enzymes are necessary to eect phage genome
internalization by the cell
The hydrodynamic model of DNA ejection does not require secondary ad hoc
mechanisms to complete genome transfer into the cell Because the water ow is
determined by the values of cyt and out the ejection process is relatively independent
of DNA condensing agents A bacterial cell responds immediately to changes in cyt and
will maintain some turgor even during phage infection Thus hydrodynamic ow from
the external environment through the phage particle into the cell cytoplasm will continue
until genome internalization is complete and the channel is closed It is not known how
this occurs in any phage system but all models of phage DNA ejection must invoke this
step in order to prevent a permanent loss of the cellular membrane potential If the
potential is totally collapsed the cell would die and no phage progeny would ever result
Furthermore although low concentrations of DNA condensing agents have a major eect
on in they have little eect on either out or cyt eg intracellular levels of polyamines
which are critical for ribosome and chromosome stability are tightly regulated This
means that phage DNA ejection in vivo should be relatively independent of the presence
of DNA condensing agents in the growth medium Indeed ongoing experiments in the
laboratory of one author IJM suggest that the latent periods and burst sizes of various
phages including parallel experiments with  and the deletion mutant b221 the latter
having a substantially reduced value relative to wild-type  of in  are not aected by
the presence of 1 mM spermine in the bacterial growth medium
The hydrodynamic model also provides a mechanism for the ejection of single-
stranded genomes and proteins into the cell during infection This is important as all
phages eject protein molecules into the infected cell and a signicant fraction of phages
do not contain dsDNA packaged at the high density of  500 mgml Any molecule in
the path of water owing along the osmotic gradient between the external medium and
the cell cytoplasm can be driven down the tail tube and into the cell As this water
ow is necessarily vectorial nucleic acids or proteins to be ejected do not need to be
positioned in the tail tube in the mature phage particle Neither do they need to possess
internal energy to drive their ejection from the capsid
In summary with the caveat that to explain the multi-step process of T5
Dynamics of Bacteriophage Genome Ejection
and perhaps other phages 29 is one known example 95 an additional ad hoc
mechanism of protein conformational changes that temporarily block water ow from
the external uid into the cell cytoplasm in turn temporarily stopping DNA ejection
the hydrodynamic model of phage DNA ejection is consistent with  and importantly
can explain  all the observations we are aware of that have been made using any
phage-host combination in vivo
However theories need to be tested experimentally Determining the kinetics of
phage genome internalization into infected cells would go a long way to supporting or
refuting competing models The internal capsid pressure models predict that the late
stages of genome ejection should slow towards a zero rate as the residual pressure equals
that in the cell cytoplasm and that a secondary process using for example polyamines
or DNA-binding proteins to interact with the entering the DNA completes the process
A secondary process is likely to occur with dierent kinetic parameters and may be
experimentally detectable Conversely the hydrodynamic model would predict a largely
constant rate of genome internalization as the osmotic pressure gradient between the
cell cytoplasm and the environment is unlikely to change substantially while viral DNA
enters the cell Unfortunately it has proved very hard to measure directly the in vivo
kinetics of genome entry outside the T7 family of phages although some measurements
have been made with phage N4 96 and experiments with both  and T5 are being
initiated in the Molineux laboratory However it may be possible using a combination
of polyamines and external osmolytes to increase the cytoplasmic osmotic pressure
above that inside the mature phage head If phage infection still occurs normally under
those conditions it would then provide irrefutable evidence that internal capsid pressure
is not important for infection although it would not provide any direct evidence for the
hydrodynamic model
