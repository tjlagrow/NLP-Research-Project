The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey is now well underway having already measured the
redshifts to 5600 galaxies in its rst season of observations Here I briey review the survey
itself before discussing in more detail some of the initial science results to have recently
appeared in the literature In particular the potential of the survey to characterize galaxy
evolution is discussed with special emphasis on the role of spectral classication Some of the
applications of this classication namely to the quantication of galaxy clustering and the
measurement of galaxy environments are also discussed here
1 The DEEP2 Survey
The DEEP2 DEEP Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe 2 Redshift Survey Davis et al9 is an
ambitious project to quantify the galaxy population and in particular its large-scale structure
at z  1 In so doing the survey will not only reveal the detailed properties of high-redshift
galaxies but will also provide a valuable cosmological probe particularly when combined with
such large local surveys as the 2dFGRS or SDSS Colless et al6 Strauss et al35
In order to achieve its goals the survey makes use of the advanced multiplexing ability
and high spectral resolution of the recently commissioned DEIMOS instrument on the Keck-
II telescope at Hawaii In so doing the survey is able to routinely determine highly accurate
redshifts and should be able to easily achieve its goal of 60000 redshifts in only 120 nights over
a three year period Such an achievement would represent an order of magnitude improvement
over any previous study of such distant galaxies

In its rst season of observations August  October 2003 the DEEP2 Redshift Survey
has already accurately measured the redshifts of  5600 galaxies out of this proposed total
of 60000 and it is the applications of this initial data-set that will be focussed on in these
proceedings
11 Galaxy selection
The galaxies observed as part of the DEEP2 Redshift Survey occupy four independent elds
for which extensive BR and I CFHT 12k x 8k photometry is available Each of these elds
is roughly 2 x 05 deg2 on the sky corresponding to comoving dimensions of 80 x 20 h1Mpc
at z  1 assuming a CDM Universe In addition to this the line-of-sight dimension of the
survey from z  07  14 corresponds to  1400 h1 Mpc so that the survey is very much
optimized towards evolutionary studies over a broad range of redshifts Each of the elds has
been chosen to occupy low-extinction regions that are continuously observable from Hawaii over
a six month interval
In addition one of the elds has been chosen to overlap the extended
Groth Survey strip Groth et al15
Galaxies are selected from the available photometry to an extinction corrected limit RAB 
241 and in all but the Groth eld a simple color-cut based upon only the observed R  I and
B  R colors has been adopted to select only high-redshift galaxies z  07 It has been shown
previously Davis et al9 that this pre-selection of high-redshift galaxies is very eective and
this is also demonstrated in Fig1 where the redshift distribution of the rst seasons observations
is shown Note that in the eld overlapping the Groth strip we will not apply this pre-selection
to the galaxies so that the full evolutionary history from z  0 can be studied there
A sophisticated automated pipeline has been developed to eciently extract and reduce the
spectra observed in the survey whilst preserving all the useful kinematic details available such
as rotation curve information Details of this pipeline will be presented in Newman et al29
The observed spectra themselves are taken at particularly high resolution R  5000 using the
DEIMOS spectrograph mounted on the Keck-II telescope Davis  Faber8 and generally span
the wavelength range of 6400    9200A Note that having such high-resolution spectra is
crucial to our analysis in that it allows us to easily work between the bright sky-lines that are
particularly prominent over this wavelength interval For galaxies with z  07 this wavelength
window allows us to measure the redshift of each galaxy particularly when the resolved Oii
doublet is present out to a redshift of z  15 Absorption based redshifts are also readily
determined primarily using the Ca HK features which are visible to redshifts of z  13
In total we currently obtain redshifts for approximately 70 of all galaxies targeted in the
survey although with recent improvements in the data-reduction pipeline this is soon expected
to reach 75-80
2 Spectral classication
The classication of galaxies is of fundamental importance for understanding galaxy populations
and for this reason is a very important aspect of any galaxy redshift survey Having a data set
of many thousands of galaxy spectra allows one to test the validity of galaxy formation and
evolution scenarios with unprecedented accuracy However the sheer size of the full spectral
data set presents its own unique problems
In order to make such a galaxy data set more
digestible some form of data compression is necessary whether this be through the adoption
of morphological classication colors or some other compressionclassication scheme If these
quantities can be determined consistently over a wide range of redshifts they can be compared
with theoretical predictions and simulations and hence set constraints on scenarios for galaxy
evolution This will be especially true if consistent classication regimes can be used for both
Figure 1 The redshift distribution of the galaxies observed so far in the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey It is
clear from this gure that the simple color-based preselection of high-redshift galaxies is working very well and
is consistently selecting only galaxies with z  07
high redshift z  1 surveys such as DEEP2 and the large z  0 surveys now approaching full
completion the SDSS and the 2dFGRS
A number of dierent approaches to the classication of galaxy spectra have been adopted for
local galaxy surveys These include the calculation of rest-frame colors eg Strateva et al34
principal component analysis PCA based spectral classications eg Connolly et al7 Bromley
et al2 Folkes et al11 Madgwick et al23 de Lapparent et al21 and other more sophisticated
discriminations eg Heavens Jimenez  Lahav16 Slonim et al32 based upon information
theory The underlying theme of all these alternative methods is that they characterize the
galaxy population exclusively in terms of their observed spectra
21 Classifying galaxies at z  1
The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey has implemented and tested the use of a PCA-based spec-
tral classication for galaxy classication Madgwick et al26 In so doing we have presented
a new spectral classication DEEP for the galaxies observed to date in the DEEP2 Redshift
Survey The main goal in developing this classication was to provide a consistent and robust
measure of the type of a galaxy over the large range of redshifts encountered in this survey To
do this special handling of incomplete and gappy observed spectra is required
Based upon previous analyses Madgwick et al24 there is strong evidence that this param-
eter DEEP will correlate well with the relative amount of star formation as expressed by the
Scalo birthrate parameter Scalo31
bScalo 
SF Rcurrent
hSF Ripast
A more detailed study of this correlation together with the role of higher order PCA projections
will be forthcoming when higher resolution spectral synthesis models become publicly available
in the near future the DEEP2 galaxy spectra are at a resolution  20 times higher than any
publicly available synthesis model
This classication  will also be particularly useful in subsequent analyses of the galaxy
luminosity function or correlation functions as it is easily comparable with other classications
Figure 2 The average spectra of our two dierent spectral types is shown The dierent relative prominence of
the nebular emission features is readily visible from this plot showing that the classication is readily separating
those galaxies with relatively more recent star-formation activity from their more passive counterparts
at z  0 for which large spectroscopic samples are now publicly available In addition previous
work eg Madgwick et al24 has shown that it is straightforward to make direct comparisons
between such a spectral classication regime and the output of semi-analytic galaxy models
eg Kaumann White  Guiderdoni19 Cole et al5 Somerville  Primack33 allowing us to
directly constrain the assumed models of galaxy formation and evolution between z  1 and
z  0 using this form of classication
3 Galaxy clustering
It is now well established that the clustering of galaxies at low redshift depends upon a variety
of factors Perhaps one of the most potentially interesting of these which has been discussed
extensively in the literature is the variation in the observed clustering with the galaxy type under
consideration eg Davis  Geller 1976 Dressler10 Lahav Nemiro  Piran20 Hermit et al17
Madgwick et al25 Of particular interest then is to establish whether the same trends are
also observable at much higher redshifts and what constraints these can place on the evolution
processes present over this period Towards this goal an initial quantication of the two-point
correlation function has recently been carried out using the rst seasons data see Coil et al4
from the DEEP2 Redshift Survey
The analysis presented by Coil et al4 made use of only 2219 galaxies drawn from a contiguous
region of the initial observations and hence only represents  5 of the total potential of the
survey However despite this very useful constraints were able to be made as to the relative
normalization of the two-point correlation function In particular it was noted that the observed
clustering of the most actively star-forming galaxies in the sample was signicantly lower than
that of the less active galaxies perhaps even more so than what is observed locally see Fig 3
As the size of the available data-set continues to increase it will be interesting to extend this
Figure 3 The projected correlation functions are shown for dierent types of galaxies in the DEEP2 Redshift
Survey Coil et al 2003
It can be seen from this gure that galaxies undergoing very little star-formation
  13 are much more strongly clustered than those with signicant amounts of recent star-formation r0 
66  11 h1 Mpc and r0  32  05 h1 Mpc respectively
analysis to investigate in particular the shape of these correlation functions as opposed to just
their normalizations as this can yield a great deal of useful information for example about the
processes governing the galaxy population under consideration see Yan Madgwick  White 36
for further discussion In addition as the data-set increases it will soon become possible to
de-couple the eects of various other properties of the samples under consideration so that
more detailed comparisons can be made eg Norberg et al30
4 Galaxy environments
The observed properties of the galaxy population have long been known to depend upon the
environment in which they are located For example red non-starforming galaxies such as
elliptical and lenticular galaxies are found to be systematically over-represented in dense envi-
ronments  such as groups and clusters eg Dressler10 Balogh et al1 Martinez et al28
Presently there are a variety of mechanisms that can readily explain these observational
trends such as the action of dynamical friction tidal stripping or gas pressure in densely occupied
environments These mechanisms together with the hierarchical model of galaxy formation 
in which galaxies formed in less dense environments and are then accreted into larger groups
and clusters  is generally consistent with the present observations However it is presently
unclear to what extent the environment of a galaxy aects its subsequent evolution since the
environment in which a galaxy has formed may be substantially dierent to the one it inhabits
in low-redshift galaxy surveys Carlberg3
The determination of the exact inuence of galaxy environment upon evolution is one area
where the advent of DEEP2 will be able to signicantly advance our understanding of the
processes involved in galaxy evolution  by giving us a representative snap-shot of the galaxy
population and its environments when the Universe was half its present age In particular when
this survey is combined with those currently available at low-redshift such as the 2dFGRS or
the SDSS we will be able to build a comprehensive picture of the evolution of the galaxy
population with which detailed models can be readily tested
41 Dening environment
The environment of a galaxy is usually dened in terms of the density of galaxies in its im-
mediate vicinity For example previous analyses have focussed on the identication of galaxies
in large groups or clusters which can be contrasted to those galaxies not inhabiting these over-
dense regions the eld population Another approach is to instead derive a continuous measure
of the galaxy density distribution eg by measuring the distance to the nth-nearest neighbor
eg Gomez et al14 or by directly smoothing the distribution on a xed scale eg Hogg et
al18
The underlying theme in all of these methods is that one requires a measure of the local
galaxy number density around each galaxy Based upon this we have chosen to dene the
environment of galaxies in the DEEP2 Redshift Survey slightly dierently by instead using the
unique volume inhabited by each galaxy which is obtained using a voronoi tessellation of the
data set In so doing we can dene a continuous sequence of inverse galaxy density without
recourse to group denitions or the need to smooth the galaxy distribution in any way The
main dierence between this method of measuring local density and those used previously is
that the voronoi volume is asymptotically local the density measured at a given point is wholly
determined by the neighboring data points with the inuence of distant points vanishing entirely
A voronoi polyhedron is the unique three-dimensional convex region of space surrounding a
data point in this case a galaxy within which every point is closer to the galaxy than to any
other data point see eg Marinoni et al27 The faces of the Voronoi polyhedron are dened by
the perpendicular bisecting planes of the vectors connecting the seed to its neighbors A galaxys
neighbors are those points connected to it by the Delaunay complexthe set of tetrahedra whose
vertices are at the data points and whose unique circumscribing spheres contain no other data
points
The voronoi partition and Delaunay complex also contain much information about the spa-
tial clustering properties of galaxies Indeed we initially computed the Voronoi partition for
the DEEP2 data-set in the context of the Voronoi-Delaunay group-nding method VDM of
Marinoni et al27 Our methods for computing the Voronoi partition are identical to theirs
and we refer the reader to that work for computational details and for further discussion of the
usefulness and historical context of the Voronoi partition and Delaunay complex A catalogue
of DEEP2 groups identied using the VDM will be presented in Gerke et al13
The voronoi volume distribution of dierent types in the DEEP2 Survey as dened by the
 spectral type parameter is shown in Fig 4 in which it can be seen that the least actively
star-forming galaxies   13 have systematically smaller voronoi volumes  showing that
they preferentially occupy the densest environments This result is consistent with previous
analyses at lower redshifts eg Balogh et al1 and shows that the environment has already
had a signicant impact on the presence of star-formation in galaxies as far back as z  1 We
are in the process of performing a similar analysis on the 2dFGRS and SDSS which will allow
us to easily make direct comparisons over this redshift interval
5 Conclusions
The DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey is now making signicant progress having already measured
redshifts to 5600 galaxies In these proceedings I have briey summarized a few of the recent
results to have come out of these initial observations focussing in particular on the role of
spectral classication in characterizing galaxy evolution
As more data becomes available in the near future it is expected that the quantication of
this evolution in the galaxy population will provide particularly strong constraints on models
of galaxy formation and evolution This along with detailed measurements of the large-scale
Figure 4 The dierent environments dened in terms of the unique volume occupied by each galaxy for dierent
types of galaxies is shown here The x-axis corresponds to the volume of a voronoi cell that has been constructed
around each galaxy and is inversely proportional to the local galaxy number density It can be seen from this gure
that galaxies undergoing very little star-formation   13 have predominantly small volumes  corresponding
to dense environments
structure at z  1 will present signicant advances in our understanding of both extra-galactic
astronomy and cosmology both of which are made possible by the remarkable scope of this
survey
