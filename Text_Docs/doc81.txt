ABSTRACT 
Machine  translation  is  the  process  of  translating  text  from  one  language  to  another  In  this  paper 
Statistical  Machine  Translation  is  done  on  Assamese  and  English  language  by  taking  their  respective 
parallel corpus A statistical phrase based translation toolkit Moses is used here To develop the language 
model and to align the words we used two another tools IRSTLM GIZA respectively BLEU score is used to 
check our translation system performance how good it is A difference in BLEU scores is obtained while 
translating  sentences 
languages  are 
morphologically  very  rich  hence translation  is  relatively  harder  from English  to  Assamese  resulting  in  a 
low BLEU score A statistical transliteration system is also introduced with our translation system to deal 
basically with proper nouns OOV out of vocabulary words which are not present in our corpus

1 INTRODUCTION 
Machine  Translation  MT  subfield  of  computational  linguistics  plays  a  major  role  in  men 
machine communication as well as men-men communication It is used to translate text from one 
natural  language  to  another  Translation  is  not  only  used  to  translate  literary  works  from  one 
language  to  another  it  is  also  used  for  translation  of  scientific  documents  technical  manuals 
documents  and  memoranda  etc  In  this  paper  we  are  showing  translation  from  two  language 
Assamese-English and vice-versa As most of the official works done in English there is a strong 
requirement  of  MT  system  to  make  it  convenient  for  common  people  Here  Statistical  Machine 
Translation  is  used  which  is  a  part  of  Machine  Translation  that  strives  to  use  machine  learning 
paradigm  towards  translating  text  Statistical  Machine  Translation  consists  of  Language  Model 
LM  Translation  ModelTM  and  Decoder  In  this  paper  bilingual  Assamese-English  Machine 
Translation  Model  has  been  developed  by  using  Moses  decoder  Other  translation  tools  like 
IRSTLM are  used  to  develop  language  model  and  GIZA  to  align  the  words  of  source  text  to 
target one The measuring metric BLEU Bilingual Evaluation Understudy is used for automatic 
evaluation that is quick and language independent 4 We also tried to compare the BLEU scores 
obtain  while  using  English-Assamese  and  Assamese-English  parallel  corpora  and  found  a 
significant  difference  in  BLEU  scores  The  difference  in  BLEU  score  tells  us  how  the 
morphology  of  Indian  language  like  Assamese  varies  from  English  We  are  trying  to  deal  with 
OOV  out  of  vocabulary  words  which  were  either  ignored  or  dropped  by  statistical  translation 
system  by  introducing  Transliteration  Transliteration  is  the  process  of  preserving  the  original 
sound by  mapping the  word from a source to target language using the pronunciation  instead  of 
translation of meaning Statistical MT techniques have not so far been widely explored for Indian 
languages We would like to explore as much as we can and see to what extent these models can 
contribute  to  the  huge  ongoing  MT  efforts  in  the  country  Assamese    language  is  one  of

the foremost languages spoken in the north eastern part of India mainly in the state of Assam by 
over 19 million native speakers It is one of the official languages of Assam It is also spoken in 
various parts of other north-eastern states  of  India The  Assamese script is  very  much similar to 
Bengali  script  Assamese  is  written  from  left  to  right  just  like  English  9There  are  various 
works  going  on  in  the  field  of  Natural  Language  Processing  in  Assamese  Assamese  is  a 
computationally  underdeveloped  language  and  research  on  NLP  is  still  at  its  developing  stage 
Some  of  the  researches  are  going  on  POS  tagging  in  Assamese  language  using  CRF  and  TRF 
10 Automatic identification of MWE Multi words Expressions 11 
2 RELATED STUDY 
There are many projects going on machine translation in India Some of them are shown below

3 TOOLS FOR IMPLEMENTING THE SYSTEM 
31 Moses 
Moses  is a statistical  machine translation system designed and  developed by Philipp Koehn and 
Hieu Hoang at the University of Edinburgh It is a software that is used in translation of sentences 
from one language to another Moses requires a parallel corpus or translated texts for eg English 
and  Assamese  that  are  used  in  training  the  system  Moses  works  in  tandem  with  SRILM  or 
IRSTLM  to  develop  the  Language  Model  and  Giza  to  develop  the  Translation  Model 
Nowadays with the increasing demand for high quality translations Moses is steadily becoming 
the most popular translation system 1 
32 Giza 
Giza  is  a  toolkit  designed  by  Franz  Josef  Och  It  is  an  extension  of  the  program  GIZA 
developed by the Statistical Machine Translation team Giza is used to develop the Translation 
Model  of  our system Giza implements different  models  like HMM and it also  helps  in  word 
alignment It also contains source for mkcls tool which is used to train word classes by maximum 
likelihood criterion 2 
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 3 No3 June 2014 
33 IRSTLM 
IRSTLM  is  a  language  modeling  tool  that  is  used  to  develop  the  language  model  for  machine 
translation system It estimates represent and computes statistical language  models It is used to 
develop the language model for the target language It is licensed under open source LGPL 3 
34 BLEU 
The  BLEU  Bi-Lingual  Evaluation  Understudy  toolkit  helps  us  to  determine  the  quality  of  our 
translation We can test  how  good our translation  is by translating the text and then running the 
BLEU script on it A simple BLEU scoring script is multi-bleuperl 14 
4 METHODOLOGY 
Statistical Machine Translation system requires parallel corpus of source and target language pair 
for translation  of sentences We  have used about 2500 parallel English and  Assamese sentences 
related to tourism domain There are three main component of the SMT system   
1  Language Model LM 
2  Translation Model TM 
3  Decoder 
Language  Model  computes  the  probability  of  target  language  sentences  Translation  Model 
calculates  the  probability  of  target  sentences  given  the  source  sentence  and  the  Decoder 
maximizes the probability of the translated text 5The architecture of our system is shown in the 
following figure 
Fig 1 Architecture of the SMT system 
41 Language Model 
The purpose of the language model is to develop fluent output by calculating the probability of a 
sentence The probability  is  computed using  n-gram  model Language Model  can be considered 
as  computation  of  the  probability  of  single  word  given  all  of  the  words  that  precede  it  in  a 
sentence  7  The  Language  Model  is  developed  using  IRSTLM  tool  The  Language  Model 
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 3 No3 June 2014 
breaks  the  probability  of  a  sentence  PS  as  the  probability  of  individual  words  Pw  shown  in 
Ps  Pw1 w2 w3 wn 
Pw1Pw2w1Pw3w1w2Pw4w1w2w3Pwnw1w2wn-1                                          1                                                        
For calculating the probability of a sentence we are first required to calculate the probability of a 
word  given  the  sequence  of  word  preceding  it16  An  n-gram  model  simplifies  the  task  by 
approximating  the  probability  of  a  word  given  all  the  previous  words  An  n-gram  of  size  1  is 
known  as  a  unigram  size  2  is  a  bigram also  known  as  digram  size  3  is  a  trigram  size  4  is  a 
four-gram and size 5 or more is simply called n-gram 5 
Suppose  for  a  large  amount  of  corpus  we  have  the  bigram  probabilities  given  in  the  following 
Eat on 
16  Eat Thai 
start I 
25  Want some 
Table 1 Bigram probabilities 
Eat some 
06  Eat breakfast 
start Id 
06  Want Thai 
Eat lunch 
06  Eat in 
start Tell 
04  To eat 
Eat dinner 
05  Eat Chinese 
start Im 
02  To have 
Eat at 
04  Eat Mexican 
I want 
32  To spend 
04  Eat tomorrow 
I would 
29  To be 
Eat Indian 
04  Eat dessert 
I dont 
08  British food 
Eat today 
03  Eat British 
I have 
04  British restaurant 
Eat French 
02  Eat American 
002  Want to 
65  British cuisine 
Eat Tomorrow 
05  Eat Japanese 
003  Want a 
05  Chinese food 
Then the probability of a sentence I want to eat Chinese food is PI want to eat British food 
 PIstart Pwant  I Pto  want Peat  to PChinese  eat Pfood  Chinese

42 Translation Model 
The  Translation  Model  calculates  similarity  between  input  and  outputThe  Translation  Model 
computes  the  probability  of  source  sentence  S  for  a  given  target  sentence  T  ie  PST  It  is 
trained from the probability of target-source language pair16 Computation of translation model 
probabilities at sentence level is quite impossible so the process is broken down into smaller units 
for  eg  words  or  phrases  and  their  probabilities  are  learned8The  target  translation  of  source 
sentence  is  thought  of  as  being  generated  from  source  word  by  word  or  phrases  For  example 
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 3 No3 June 2014 
using  the  notation  TS  to  represent  an  input  sentence  S  and  its  translation  T  a  sentence  is 
translated as given below 
    Udaipur is a famous city 
Udaipur is a famous city 
    
43 Decoder 
Decoding  is the process  of finding a target translation sentence EnglishAssamese for a source 
sentence AssameseEnglish using translation  model  and  language  model Decoding  is a search 
problem which maximizes the translation and language model probability The words and phrases 
are  chosen  which  have  maximum  probability  of  being  the  translated  translation  6  Search  for 
sentence T is performed that maximizes PSTie 
Pr ST  argmax P T P ST                                                   2 
44 Preparing Data For Training 
Before training the data we have to perform some tasks We have to prepare the data for training 
the translation system The following steps are performed 
  Tokenizing We have to tokenize the data so that spaces are inserted between words and 
punctuation 1 
  Truecasing  We  then  set  the  case  of  the  first  word  in  each  sentence  and  this  is  done  by 
truecasing the data 1 
  Cleaning Then we have to clean the data ie remove empty lines extra spaces and some 
lines that are too short or too long 1 
We  can  now  train  our  translation  model  After  training  is  completed  a  mosesini  is  generated 
which is used in running the Moses decoder We can improve our translation system by tuning the 
data  Tuning  the  system  again  results  in  a  mosesini  file  We  can  now  use  this  file  to  run  the 
decoder1 
45 Corpus Preparation 
A corpus is a collection  of  written text in  linguistics research used to  do statistical analysis and 
hypothesis testing 15 Our corpus consists of parallel text in English and  Assamese  languages 
The corpus is mostly based on travel and tourism in India A sample of the corpus is shown in the 
following table

Jama Masjid is the largest mosque in India  
The present temple known as the Maha Meru 
Prasad was rebuilt about 25 years ago on the 
location of the original shrine in accordance 
with ancient plans  
   
      
           
        
46 Transliteration 
As we are provided with a very small amount of corpus it is not possible to cover all the words 
Some  proper  nouns  ie  names  of  people  places  etc  are  not  translated  as  they  are  not  in  our 
corpus So we tried to introduce the transliteration system into our SMT system Transliteration is 
defined as the process of automatically mapping a character from one language with the character 
from  another  language  such  that  it  preserves  the  pronunciation  of  the  original  source  word  For 
example 
k-u-m-a-r -- --- 
We have used a Perl script to retrieve those words which are not translated or which are not in our 
corpus In the Perl file we have stored all the Assamese characters along with their corresponding 
English transliterations and executed the Perl script with Moses A sample test result is shown in 
the following table

Panaji    
    
International Journal on Natural Language Computing IJNLC Vol 3 No3 June 2014 
In the first example     the actual spelling of the  word  is  As we 
have  taken  the  letterd  as  the  transliteration  letter  for    instead  of    so  we  cannot  get  the 
correct word Likewise we cannot obtain the correct word for some sentences both in English and 
Assamese  This  is  because  we  are  concentrating  only  on  the  phonetic  transcription  We  are 
thinking to tryout some other methods which will solve this problem 
5 RESULTS AND EVALUATION OF BLEU SCORE 
We  have trained the system and as a result a  mosesini configuration file is  generated We  have 
used this file to run Moses Again we have tuned the system to get a better output As our system 
is  built  with  a  very  limited  parallel  corpus  about  2500  sentences  some  of  our  translations  are 
quite  rough  but  understandable  We  have  trained  a  system  for  Assamese  to  English  translation 
and  another  system  for  English  to  Assamese  translation  The  test  results  are  explained  in  the 
following tables

We  have  evaluated  the  BLEU  score  for  our  translated  sentences  using  the  BLEU  Bilingual 
Evaluation  Understudy  toolkit  BLEU  score  determines  the  efficiency  of  our  system  ie  how 
good our translation system is The following table shows the scores of Assamese to English and 
English to Assamese translation 
Table 6 Bleu Score 
SourceTarget 
AssameseEnglish 
EnglishAssamese 
Bleu Score 
Our BLEU scores are quite low because of the lesser availability of parallel corpus Also though 
we  have  used  the  same  corpus  for  training  Assamese-English  system  and  English-Assamese 
system  we  are  getting  a  vast  difference  in  BLEU  scores  This  is  because  Indian  languages  are 
morphologically  very  rich  and  translation  from  English  to  Assamese  is  relatively  harder  than 
Assamese to English translation 
6 CONCLUSIONS 
We have tried to build both  Assamese to English and  English to  Assamese translation using the 
same parallel corpus We are successful in our job to quite an extent but still we feel that there is

statistical 
much improvement to be made About 2500 sentences are used for training both the system But 
this is quite less because for a better translation system the size of parallel corpus should be large 
As our system is phrase-based increasing the number of sentences will increase the quality of the 
translated text We will work on this problem and try to increase the number of sentences into our 
system Also we will try to put our system into web-based portal rather than displaying the output 
in  the  terminal  We  will  also  try  to  build  a  more  developed  translation  system  so  that  we  can 
enhance  our  translation  result  and  contribute  a  lot  to  the  field  of  Assamese  Natural  Language 
Processing
