Abstract
The galaxies NGC 4911 and 4921 in the Coma cluster provide spectacular exam-
ples of luminous grand design spirals passing through the hot intracluster medium
of a rich cluster of galaxies Chandra ACIS-I imaging of their environment coupled
with CFHT HSTWFPC2 and VLA radio imaging reveal the interactions between
the hot X-ray gas and the ISM of the spirals highlighting the linkage between galaxy
and cluster evolution generated by such interactions
Keywords Galaxies interactions clusters ICM
1 Introduction
Coma like most large clusters of galaxies is still being built through
infall of subclusters and smaller groups Evolution of the infalling galax-
ies is altered by the cluster environment where hot intracluster gas can
ablate or strip the interstellar medium of galaxies radically altering
their star formation histories Systems can be harassed Moore et
al 1996 or in the extreme even completely disrupted by tidal forces
spilling their contents throughout intracluster space Gregg  West
1998 Infalling gas stripped from galaxies augments and heats the intr-
acluster medium ICM thereby accelerating galaxy evolution through
ram-pressure stripping Over time the material removed from galaxies
is recycled into an ever-growing intracluster population of stars gas
and dwarf galaxies eg West et al 1995 Cote Marzke  West 1998
Cote et al 2000 Thompson  Gregory 1993 Lopez-Cruz et al 1997
There are two giant spiral galaxies in the core of Coma NGC4911
and NGC4921 which are undergoing intense and stressful interactions
with their environment Gregg  West 1998 documented several ex-
tended low surface brightness LSB objects in the Coma cluster one
of which is trailing NGC4911 into the core of Coma Figure 1 Such
LSB features are most likely transient produced by galaxy-galaxy in-
teractions or by stripping of galaxies by the global cluster tidal eld
and ICM

2 Optical Observations
We have obtained HSTWFPC2 V F606W and I F814W images of
NGC 4911 and also of its LSB tidal debris wake The left panel in Fig-
ure 1 shows the original discovery image of the LSB material following
in the wake of NGC 4911 at this contrast the galaxy and its companion
S0 are burned into one The center panel shows the WFPC2 V image
of NGC 4911 at intermediate contrast to reveal the companion the
WF chips are lled with extended low surface brightness material from
NGC4911 The right panel shows just the PC chip to reveal the nuclear
region there appears to be a disembodied spiral arc of enhanced surface
brightness on the leading side of the disk toward the cluster core which
is 029 away This arc may be an example of ram-pressure-induced star
formation perhaps a bow shock as NGC 4911 plows through the hot
X-ray emitting ICM in Coma

debris following NGC 4911 Center WFPC2 F606W V-band image of NGC4911

the tidal debris but itself shows no morphological disturbances Right F606W
V-band PC eld shown at dierent stretch to reveal more detail The core of
Coma is to the upper right on this side of the galaxy is a bright disjoint spiral arm
perhaps the result of ram pressure-induced star formation
The second WFPC2 eld was obtained with most of the trailing
LSB material on WF3 clearly seen in Figure 2 Using sextractor
we have cataloged all objects in the LSB image a 3 excess of objects is
found in the WF3 chip relative to the other two WFPC2 elds These
objects have roughly globular cluster luminosities if these are really
in Coma we are witnessing the present-epoch creation of intergalactic
star clusters We will be obtaining redshifts with Keck for the brightest
objects in this eld a spectrum obtained last year shows that one of
the brightest has emission lines and a velocity placing it in the cluster

3 X-ray Observations
We obtained a 65ks Chandra image centered near NGC4911 a known
X-ray sources Our Chandra X-ray spectrum of NGC4911 shows that
it houses an active galactic nucleus perhaps spawned by the same
interactions which have produced the LSB material
Of the many point sources in our Chandra eld two have optical
counterparts in the WF3 eld of the LSB material  circles in Figure 2
The brighter of these has a soft X-ray spectrum consistent with being
an X-ray binary in Coma with a luminosity of  7  1038 ergss
The other two WFPC2 chips have no X-ray point sources with optical
counterparts
4 Radio Observations
VLA 21cm observations also show evidence for interactions between
NGC 4911 and the intracluster medium Figure 3 The VLA obser-
vations also captured the continuum of NGC4921 a giant spiral to
the east of NGC4911 Both galaxies appear to be losing their ISM as
indicated by the distorted asymmetric and owing contours seen in the

show similar behavior for these galaxies and other smaller spirals in
5 Summary
 Coma dominated by early type galaxies is still accreting spiral
galaxies at the present epoch
 The spirals are being drastically transformed by their interaction
with the cluster Vigorous star formation is induced using up the
gas and the ICM also removes gas by heating and stripping the
galaxies ISM
 The outer stellar portions of NGC4911 are being removed by the
global cluster tidal eld or its S0 companion further altering its
evolution
 The stripped material will eventually disburse throughout the core
of Coma augmenting the general intergalactic populations of stars
star clusters gas and perhaps even X-ray binaries Through this
process the infalling galaxies in turn help drive the evolution of
the whole cluster
