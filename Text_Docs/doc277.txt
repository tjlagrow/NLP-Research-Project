A JavaScript Passive Evolution Calculator
When there is no new star formation galaxies evolve passively ie they redden and fade as
stars turn off of the main sequence In principle this evolution can be measured by comparing the
mass-to-light ratios and colors of distant passively evolving galaxies to those of nearby ones The
measured evolution can then be compared to predictions from stellar population syntesis models
to determine ages and other parameters
This technique has been applied successfully to determine the ages of early-type galaxies in the
eld and clusters out to redshifts z  125 eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Treu et al 2002 van
der Wel et al 2004 However there is growing evidence that the number of early-type galaxies
is not stable with time but decreases with redshift eg Dressler et al 1997 van Dokkum et al
2000 Bell et al 2004 The implication of such complex evolution is that the sample of early-
type galaxies at high redshift is a biased subset of the sample at z  0 containing only the oldest
progenitors of todays early-types This progenitor bias leads us to overestimate the ages of
todays early-type galaxies
In van Dokkum  Franx 2001 we quantied the effects of progenitor bias on the observed
luminosity and color evolution of early-type galaxies and developed a simple model which can
provide the bias-corrected ages of early-type galaxies for an assumed rate of morphological evolu-
tion Here we present a JavaScript calculator for predicting the luminosity and color evolution of
passively evolving galaxies based on the van Dokkum  Franx 2001 parameterization
Simple evolution
In its simplest form the calculator provides the evolution of a stellar population with a given
luminosity-weighted formation redshift Default 1 Figure 1 shows examples of the output for
a stellar population formed at z  6
Figure 1 Example output for a single stellar population formed at z  6
Complex evolution
The calculator can also incorporate morphological evolution ie progenitor bias and complex
star formation histories of individual galaxies The calculator provides the luminosity evolution
scatter in luminosity color evolution scatter in color the fraction of todays early-type galaxies
formed at a given redshift and the luminosity-weighted stellar formation redshift of the early-types
at that redshift The example below shows some of the output for Default 3 a model with strong
morphological evolution
Figure 2 Model with strong morphological evolution Although only  20  of present-day early-types
were in place by z  2 the luminosity evolution is very similar to that in Fig 1 and the scatter in V - K color
is small at all redshifts These counter-intuitive trends are explained in van Dokkum  Franx 2001
