ABSTRACT
We employ a bias-corrected abundance matching technique to investigate the coevo-
lution of the CDM dark halo mass function HMF the observationally derived
velocity dispersion and stellar mass functions VDF SMF of galaxies between z  1
and 0 We use for the rst time the evolution of the VDF constrained through strong
lensing statistics by Chae 2010 for galaxy-halo abundance matching studies As a
local benchmark we use a couple of z  0 VDFs a Monte-Carlo realised VDF based
on SDSS DR5 and a directly measured VDF based on SDSS DR6 We then focus on
connecting the VDF evolution to the HMF evolution predicted by N -body simulations
and the SMF evolution constrained by galaxy surveys On the VDF-HMF connection
we nd that the local dark halo virial mass-central stellar velocity dispersion Mvir-
relation is in good agreement with the individual properties of well-studied low-redshift
dark haloes and the VDF evolution closely parallels the HMF evolution meaning lit-
tle evolution in the Mvir- relation On the VDF-SMF connection it is also likely
that the stellar mass-stellar velocity dispersion M- relation evolves little taking
the abundance matching results together with other independent observational results
and hydrodynamic simulation results Our results support the simple picture that as
the halo grows hierarchically the stellar mass and the central stellar velocity disper-
sion grow in parallel We discuss possible implications of this parallel coevolution for
galaxy formation and evolution under the CDM paradigm

INTRODUCTION
The current CDM hierarchical structure formation the-
ory predicts robustly the evolution of the dark halo mass1
function HMF over cosmic time eg Springel et al
2005 Warren et al 2006 Reed et al 2007 Lukic et al
2007 Tinker et al 2008 Klypin et al 2010 Because vis-
ible galaxies are believed to form and reside within the
haloes under the CDM paradigm the statistical func-
tions of galaxies such as the luminosity function LF the
stellar mass function SMF and the stellar velocity dis-
persion function VF VDF are also expected to evolve
Connection of these statistical functions of galaxies with
the theoretical HMF is not straightforward due to and
1 Throughout this refers to the total mass within the virial radius
of the halo Accordingly it includes the stellar mass once the
galaxy is formed
mirrors the complex processes of galaxy formation and
evolution including star formations supernovae explosions
AGN activities and galaxy merging Some recent works in
the literature are focused on the connection of the HMF
with the broadly measured stellar mass function SMF of
galaxies eg Conroy  Wechsler 2009 Moster et al 2009
Guo et al 2009 Notice that the SMF as well as the LF have
mainly to do with the star formation history of galaxies
Galaxy formation in the halo has dynamical conse-
quences as well As stars are formed in the inner halo the
halo responds and the inner halo dark matter distribution is
modied eg Blumenthal et al 1986 Gnedin et al 2004
Rudd et al 2008 Abadi et al 2009 Tissera et al 2010
Consequently not only the total ie dark plus stellar mass
distribution but also the dark matter distribution may be-
come dierent from the pure dark matter distribution pre-
dicted by the CDM This dynamical aspect of galaxy for-
mation is a crucial part of cosmological studies Ultimately
2 K-H Chae
the theory of galaxy formation should predict successfully
the dynamical evolution as well as the star formation history
of galaxies The statistical property of the dynamics of galax-
ies is encoded in the VDF of galaxies The local total VDF
is carefully reconstructed by Chae 2010 using SDSS DR5
galaxy counts and intrinsic correlations between luminosi-
ties and velocities of galaxies More recently Bernardi et al
2010 estimates directly the local total VDF based on SDSS
DR6 measurements of a DR4 sample Chae 2010 then
constrains the evolution of the VDF up to z  1 through
the statistical properties of strong lensing galaxies based on
the empirical result that the average total luminous plus
dark mass prole of galaxies is isothermal in the optical
region Chae 2010 notices that the dierential evolution of
the derived VDF is qualitatively similar to the evolution of
the theoretical HMF under the current CDM paradigm
In this work we make a detailed quantitative compar-
ison between the VDF evolution constrained from strong
lensing statistics through the method of Chae 2010 and
the evolutions of mass functions ie the HMF and the SMF
from the literature In doing so we investigate the local sta-
tistical correlations of the velocity dispersion  of a galaxy
with the virial mass Mvir of the surrounding halo and the
stellar mass M of the galaxy ie Mvir and M
and their evolutions out to z  1 These empirical correla-
tions will provide independent statistical constraints on the
structures of galaxies and haloes and their evolutions We
investigate the implications of the local correlations for the
baryon-modied dark halo structures in a following work
In this work we focus on the evolutions of the correlations
We nd that the halo mass the stellar mass and the stel-
lar velocity dispersion are coevolving in a parallel way for
0  z  1 We discuss the implications of this result for
galaxy formation and evolution under the CDM paradigm
This paper is organised as follows In 2 we describe
the method of analysis and the statistical functions to be
used in this work some details of the analysis are given in
the Appendix A In 3 we investigate the connection be-
tween the evolving VDF of galaxies from the SDSS and
strong lensing statistics and the HMF from N-body simu-
lations We obtain the relation Mvir and its evolution
We also examine the compatibility of the evolutions of the
VDF and the HMF In 4 we compare the VDF evolution
with the SMF evolution from galaxy surveys We investigate
the evolution of M and the compatibility of the cur-
rent observationally constrained VDF and SMF In 5 we
discuss the implications of the results for galaxy formation
and evolution in the context of the current CDM struc-
ture formation paradigm and cosmological observations We
conclude in 6 Unless specied otherwise we assume a
WMAP 5 year CDM cosmology Dunkley et al 2009 with
m0 0  025 075 and H0  100h km s1 Mpc1
When parameter h does not appear explicitly h  07 is as-
sumed In Appendix B we compare the results of this work
with the nearly concurrent results by Dutton et al 2010
Dutton et al 2010 focus on the connection between the
circular velocity in the optical region at about the pro-
jected half-light radius vopt and that at the virial radius
vvir While Dutton et al 2010 use various estimates of the
halo mass including satellite kinematics weak lensing and
abundance matching their results are conned to z  0
Another important dierence between Dutton et al 2010
x  cid12cid12cid12cid12
dn x
cid12cid12cid12cid12
and this work is that Dutton et al 2010 use observed stel-
lar mass-velocity relations while this work uses the observa-
tionally derived velocity dispersion functions for abundance
matching
2 METHOD ABUNDANCE MATCHING OF
STATISTICAL FUNCTIONS
A statistical function of galaxies or haloes at a given epoch
is dened by
where x is the variable under consideration eg  M
Mvir and n x is the integrated comoving number density
down to x
the abundance matching method eg
Kravtsov et al 2004 Vale  Ostriker 2004 Conroy et al
2006 to relate statistically one variable x to another y
Namely we have
y  yx or x  xy
from n x  n y
The key assumption for equation 2 to be valid is that the
two variables are monotonically increasing functions of each
other The accuracy of the median relation between x and y
derived from the abundance matching method depends on
the nature of the intrinsic scatter of the true relation see
Tasitsiomi et al 2004 Behroozi et al 2010 In Appendix A
a simulation is carried out to investigate the possible eect of
the intrinsic scatter It turns out that based on an observa-
tionally motivated intrinsic scatter the abundance matching
method reproduces the overall behaviour of the intrinsic re-
lation up to a maximum bias of  008 dex in most cases We
estimate and correct the biases in our abundance matching
analyses
This work is primarily concerned with connecting the
stellar velocity dispersion of a galaxy  to the dark halo
virial mass Mvir and the galaxy stellar mass M For
the VDF at z  0 we use the results from Chae 2010
and Bernardi et al 2010 Fig 1 Specically we use the
A0 VDF of Chae 2010 that is a result from combining
the early-type and the late-type VDFs based on SDSS DR5
data The Bernardi et al 2010 VDF is a direct t to all-
type galaxies based on SDSS DR6 Bernardi et al 2010
give various t results depending on the range of velocity
dispersion and t method For this work we use the t re-
sult for   125 km s1 taking into account measurement
errors because this work is primarily concerned with the
evolution of massive galaxies We then use strong lensing
statistical analysis of Chae 2010 to constrain the evolution
of the VDF up to z  1 The results are shown in Fig 1 The
result for the Chae 2010 VDF is a reproduction while that
for the Bernardi et al 2010 VDF is a new result Notice
that for the Bernardi et al 2010 VDF a modied Schechter
function introduced by Sheth et al 2003 is used while for
the Chae 2010 VDF a correction term is included The
simplicity of the Bernardi et al 2010 VDF allows all four
parameters of the function to be varied and constrained by
strong lensing data in contrast to the Chae 2010 VDF
for which some parameters must be xed see 53 of Chae

3 CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
OBSERVATIONAL VDF AND THE HMF
FROM N-BODY SIMULATIONS
In the CDM hierarchical structure formation picture the
dark halo mass function HMF evolves over cosmic time as
a consequence of hierarchical merging eg White  Rees
1978 Lacey  Cole 1993 Accordingly the statistical func-
tions of galaxies such as the VDF and the SMF are also ex-
pected to evolve However baryon physics complicates the
evolutions of the VDF and the SMF making it non-trivial
to compare the evolutions of the HMF the SMF and the
VDF one another Conversely careful analyses of the coevo-
lution of the HMF the SMF and the VDF may reveal key
insights into galaxy formation and evolution processes Here
we compare the evolution of the VDF described in Section 2
with the evolution of the HMF from cosmological N-body
simulations A comparison between the VDF and the SMF
is given in the next section
The HMF may be determined analytically eg
Press  Schechter 1974 Sheth  Tormen 1999 2002 or
through N -body simulations
eg Jenkins et al 2001
Springel et al 2005 Warren et al 2006 Reed et al 2007
Lukic et al 2007 Tinker et al 2008 Recent high resolu-
tion N -body simulations have determined the HMF reliably
eg Warren et al 2006 Reed et al 2007 Lukic et al 2007
Tinker et al 2008 For the HMF we generate a numeri-
cal function using the code provided by Reed et al 2007
taking the following cosmological parameters m0  025
0  075 and 8  08 consistent with the WMAP5
Figure 1 Velocity dispersion functions VDFs of galaxies at
z  0 and z  1 The VDFs at z  0 are those from Chae 2010
and Bernardi et al 2010 The VDF by Chae 2010 is a sum
of the early-type and late-type VDFs based on SDSS DR5 data
The VDF by Bernardi et al 2010 is a direct t for all galaxies
based on SDSS DR6 The VDF by Chae 2010 is also reproduced
as a dashed curve on the upper right panel for comparison The
constraints on the VDFs at z  1 are based on strong lensing
statistics described in Chae 2010 Notice that strong lensing
data probe only the range of 95 km s1    300 km s1 see
the texts in  2
Notice that the strong lensing surveys used to constrain
the evolution of the VDF are limited to lensing galaxies with
image splitting greater than 03 arcsec in the redshift range
of 03  z  1 see Chae 2010 This lower limit on image
splitting implies that the constrained evolution of the VDF
is strictly valid only for   95 km s1 This in turn cor-
responds to M  10102M and Mvir  10116M as will
be shown below Furthermore although the surveys do not
have physically meaningful upper limits on image separa-
tions the surveys because of the small sample sizes have
only identied lensing galaxies with measured or implied
stellar velocity dispersion   300 km s1 with correspond-
ing M  10118M and Mvir  10146M as shown below
This is why the constraints on the VDF evolution become
weak toward large  as shown in Fig 1 Hence any results
from this work outside the above ranges must be regarded
as extrapolations
For the HMF we use a typical numerical result from N-
body simulations under the current CDM cosmology while
for the SMF we use the results from some representative
4 K-H Chae
data Dunkley et al 2009 This function includes only dis-
tinct haloes that are not parts of larger haloes We correct
it to include subhaloes since they may also host galaxies2
We use the simulation results by Conroy et al 2006 for
the number fraction of subhaloes fsub as a function of
maximum circular velocity By relating the maximum cir-
cular velocity to the halo virial mass using the scaling given
by Klypin et al 2010 we nd a varying fraction from
fsub  025  018 at Mvir  1011M this mass scale
corresponds to the Conroy et al 2006 completeness limit
to  008  008 at Mvir  1013M for z  0 z  1
Notice that the mass of a distinct halo refers to the epoch
under consideration while that of a subhalo is the mass at
the time it accreted onto a larger halo
The mass of a halo Mvir may be linked to the stellar
velocity dispersion  of the central galaxy for those haloes
that host galaxies If the halo did not host a galaxy in its
centre the central velocity dispersion of dark matter par-
ticles would be entirely due to the dark mass potential In
reality the central galaxy contributes to the central gravita-
tional potential with the degree of contribution varying from
one system to another The functional relation Mvir will
depend not only on the stellar mass distribution of the re-
siding galaxy but also how the dark halo has been modied
due to the baryonic physics of galaxy formation Moreover
the stellar mass distribution itself is correlated with Mvir
to some degree Thus we may use the abundance matching
relation between Mvir and  to gain new insights into the
structure of the baryon-modied dark halo and the dynam-
ical aspect of galaxy formation and evolution
31 The Mvir- relation at z  0
Fig 3 shows the abundance matching Mvir- relation at
z  0 It shows both the relations ignoring intrinsic scatters
and those taking into account an intrinsic scatter distribu-
tion of V  log10 km s1 as a function of Mvir For the
latter case the intrinsic scatter distribution is predicted by
a bivariate distribution of  and M as a function of Mvir
based on an observed scatter of log10M at xed Mvir and
an observed scatter distribution of V as a function of M
The reader is referred to Appendix A for a brief description
and a following work in preparation for further details
The abundance matching relation is compared against
the measured values of Mvir and  for individual galax-
iesclusters with z  03 Although there are numerous
galaxiesclusters for which either  or Mvir is reported
only for relatively few systems both Mvir and  have
been measured reliably so far First we consider the best-
studied Milky Way galaxy for which recent measurements
appear to be reasonably concordant Klypin et al 2002
Battaglia et al 2005 2006 Xue et al 20083 The data from
Xue et al 2008 are displayed in Fig 3 Second we dis-
play the results for 22 SLACS lensing galaxies at mean red-
shift of z  02 by Gavazzi et al 2007 They combine
2 This correction has only a relatively minor eect in particular
for large mass
3 The Andromeda galaxy is also a well-studied example but the
inferred virial masses appear to still vary by a factor of 2 eg
Klypin et al 2002 Seigar et al 2008
Figure 3 The relation between the halo virial mass Mvir
and the stellar velocity dispersion  of the central galaxy at
z  0 inferred from the abundance matching of the velocity
dispersion function and the CDM halo mass function see the
texts in 3 The red curves are the results ignoring the scat-
ter of V  log10 km s1 at xed Mvir The black curves
are the results taking into account the scatter shaded green
See Appendix A for a brief description of the scatter The solid
and dashed curves are respectively based on the VDFs by Chae
2010 and Bernardi et al 2010 The dotted line is a prediction
of the SIS model of the halo The curves are compared against
the individual measurements for the following systems Triangles
- Milky Way Xue et al 2008 Star - A weighted mean of 22
SLACS lenses Gavazzi et al 2007 at z  02 taking the stan-
dard deviation of the individual mean values as the error on 
Circle - Lens system Q0957561 at z  036 The velocity dis-
persion is from Tonry  Franx 1999 while the virial mass is

halo model
strong and weak lensing and stellar kinematics to analyse
the systems Third we consider the rst ever discovered
lens system Q0957561 at z  036 which is the best stud-
ied lens system including a cluster for the lens potential
The velocity dispersion for the central galaxy is reported by
Tonry  Franx 1999 The virial mass of the cluster is from
Nakajima et al 2009 who derive the halo mass through
weak lensing and nd that their result is consistent with the
result by Chartas et al 2002 through X-ray observations
Finally we consider galaxy cluster Abell 611 that has been
studied extensively by Newman et al 2009 through a com-
bination of strong and weak lensing and stellar kinematics
As shown in Fig 3 these individual measurements are in
excellent agreement with the Mvir- relation based on the
abundance matching of statistical functions This agreement
bolsters the validity of the Mvir- relation at z  0
Notice that the Mvir- relation shown in Fig 3 is a
curve rather than a straight line Consequently it does not
match well the prediction by the singular isothermal sphere
Coevolution of galaxies and dark haloes
Figure 4 The abundance matching Mvir- relation at z  1 is
compared with that at z  0 It is consistent with zero evolution
between z  1 and z  0 for the strong lensing probed range
  300 km s1 Mvir  10146M see 2
SIS halo model see eg Li  Ostriker 2002 The failure
of the SIS model is evident for Mvir  1013M as noticed by
several authors eg Li  Ostriker 2002 Kochanek  White
2001 Blumenthal et al 1986 This result conrms the crit-
ical halo mass Mc  1013M below which the baryonic ef-
fects start to become signicant for the inner halo dynamics
and structure However even for Mvir  1013M the SIS
model is not very successful in matching the empirically de-
termined Mvir curve This implies that the SIS model is
not precise as a global model of the galactic halo despite
the fact that a range of observational constraints support
the isothermal prole for the inner part of the halo see
Chae 2010 and references theirin The underprediction of
 by the SIS model for Mvir  1013M probably reects
the neglected concentration of the halo The curvature in
the Mvir- relation may reect the systematic variation of
halo concentration but may also imply the varying bary-
onic eects on the halo structures The internal structures
of the haloes may be constrained by combining dynamical
constraints with the empirical Mvir- relation in prepara-
32 The coevolution of the HMF and the VDF
In Fig 4 we compare the abundance matching Mvir- rela-
tions at z  1 and 0 This comparison shows little sign of
evolution in the Mvir- relation for the strong lensing probed
range   300 km s1 Mvir  10146M see 2 The near
constancy in the Mvir- relation with z implies that the
HMF and the VDF are coevolving in parallel Namely as
the halo grows in mass over cosmic time the central stellar
velocity dispersion grows in accordance The natural ques-
tion to ask is then what the origin of this coevolution is We
discuss this in 5
Alternatively we may transform the HMF into a VDF
using the z  0 relation of Fig 4 and assuming a certain
evolution of the Mvir- relation Fig 5 shows the VDFs pre-
dicted from the HMFs assuming zero evolution of the Mvir-
relation In Fig 5 the HMF-converted VDFs are compared
Figure 5 The observationally constrained VDFs at z  0
and z  1 are compared with the VDFs predicted from the
CDM halo mass function using the empirically determined rela-
tion Mvir at z  0 assuming zero evolution see Fig 4 There
is a reasonably good match between the observationally derived
VDF evolution and the halo-predicted VDF evolution
with the observationally derived local VDFs and the lens-
ing constrained VDFs at z  1 The VDFs at z  0 are in
excellent agreement with each other The VDFs at z  1
are also in agreement with each other This exercise shows
that under the simple assumption of the constancy of the
Mvir- relation in time the evolution of the HMF predicted
by the current CDM cosmology can match well the evolu-
tion of the VDF constrained by strong lensing statistics for
0  z  1
4 CONNECTION BETWEEN THE
OBSERVATIONAL VDF AND THE SMF
FROM GALAXY SURVEYS
Many recent surveys of galaxies have been used to con-
strain the evolution of galaxies through the LF orand
the SMF The results are at variance Many results ar-
gue for relatively little evolution in the number den-
sity of most massive galaxies and greater evolution of
less massive galaxies over cosmic time
ie a stel-
lar mass-downsizing anti-hierarchical behaviour eg
Cimatti et al 2006 Fontana et al 2006 Pozzetti et al
2007 Conselice et al 2007 Scarlata et al 2007 Cool et al
2008 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 Marchesini et al 2009
although there are results that do not particularly sup-
port a mass-downsizing evolution eg Bell et al 2004
Faber et al 2007 Brown et al 2008 Ilbert et al 2010 The
variance for the evolution of the SMF is not well understood
but may be due to errors in measurements and modelling of
the SMF see Longhetti  Saracco 2009 and galaxy sample
biases caused by cosmic variance see eg Faber et al 2007
Cattaneo et al 2008 Stringer et al 2009 for discussions
We have seen in the previous section that the strong
lensing constrained VDF evolution is in line with the theo-
retical HMF evolution How well would the VDF match the
6 K-H Chae
observed SMF from galaxy surveys What would be the cor-
relation between stellar mass M and velocity dispersion
 and its evolution up to z  1 The coevolution of the
SMF and the VDF will depend on the evolution of the M-
 relation Hence the evolution of the VDF can be tested
against the evolution of the SMF only when the M- re-
lation is known or assumed as a function of cosmic time
Conversely by matching the observed SMF evolution from
galaxy surveys with the VDF evolution from strong lensing
statistics we may infer the evolution of the M- relation
In the following we take the latter approach
We match the VDFs by Chae 2010 and Bernardi et al
2010 their evolutions being constrained by strong lensing
with two total SMFs from galaxy surveys see Fig 2 that
are qualitatively dierent and are intended to encompass the
current range of observations One is the COSMOS SMF by
Ilbert et al 2010 measured using 192000 galaxies from the
COSMOS 2-deg2 eld The COSMOS sample size is much
larger than any other single data set that has been used to
derive the SMF up to z  1 For the Ilbert et al 2010
SMF z  0 function is actually for 02  z  04 while
z  1 function is a mean of 08  z  10 and 10  z 
12 functions Notice that the Ilbert et al 2010 SMF does
not show a stellar mass-downsizing evolution The other is
the Spitzer SMF by Perez-Gonzalez et al 20084 This is
a typical SMF that shows a downsizing behaviour For the
Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 SMF z  0 function is actually
for 0  z  02 while z  1 function is a mean of 08 
z  10 and 10  z  13 functions We note that the
Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 sample covers a sky area of only
 664 arcmin2 and contains  28 000 sources for 0  z  4
41 The M- relation at z  0
Fig 6 shows several examples of the abundance matching
relation between M and  at z  0 For z  0 only we con-
sider the Bernardi et al 2010 SMF as well as the COS-
MOS and the Spitzer SMFs These results have been ob-
tained taking into account the eect of an adopted intrinsic
scatter the region shaded green for V  log10 km s1
of 0115  0039  m  10 with m  log10MM
from Desroches et al 2007 see Appendix A The details
on the eect of the intrinsic scatter can be found in Ap-
pendix A Notice that the abundance matching M- re-
lations have mild curvatures For a linear approximation
V  bm  const the slope b varies from b  023 034 for
m  115 to b  035 049 for m  105 The abundance
matching relations for all galaxies are compared with the di-
rectly measured median relations for early-type galaxies in
the literature Desroches et al 2007 Hyde  Bernardi 2009
Shankar et al 2010 The abundance matching relations
agree well with the early-type relations for M  10116M
However as M decreases the abundance matching rela-
tions deviate systematically and increasingly from the early-
type relations This is expected and can be well understood
by the fact that the late-type relation is dierent from the
4 Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 adopt the Salpeter IMF to calcu-
late their stellar masses To convert their stellar masses to those
based on the Chabrier IMF we divide by 17
Figure 6 The abundance matching relation between the stellar
mass M and the stellar velocity dispersion  of galaxies at
z  0 Black gray solid dashed and dotted curves are respec-
tively the results of matching the Chae 2010 Bernardi et al
2010 VDF with the COSMOS SMF by Ilbert et al 2010
the Spitzer SMF by Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 and the SDSS
SMF by Bernardi et al 2010 for all galaxies These abundance
matching results have been corrected for the eects of the in-
trinsic scatter shaded green The intrinsic scatter and its eects
are described in Appendix A The red solid dashed and dot-
ted curveslines are the measured median M- relations re-
spectively by Desroches et al 2007 Hyde  Bernardi 2009
and Shankar et al 2010 for early-type galaxies Notice that the
abundance matching relations agree well with the measured early-
type relations at high M but deviate systematically as M gets
lower because the late-type contribution becomes increasingly
larger
early-type relation and the late-type contribution to the to-
tal relation increases as M decreases
42 The M- relation at z  1 and its evolution to
In Fig 7 the abundance matching M- relation at z  1
is shown and compared with that at z  0 The relation
at z  1 is also compared against the individual data
points for 07  z  13 from di Serego Alighieri 2005
and van der Wel et al 2005 The resulting evolution of
the M- relation varies depending mostly on the adopted
SMF Notice that the strictly valid range probed by the
data is 197  V  log10 km s1  247 corresponding
to 102  m log10MM  118 see 2 The results
outside this range are extrapolations
For the COSMOS SMF the M- relation is consistent
with zero evolution The relation at z  1 is also consistent
with the measured data points On the other hand for the
Spitzer SMF a typical downsizing SMF the z  1 relation
deviates systematically from the z  0 relation in particular

the case for any downsizing SMF This is because the evolu-

higher z for 05  1011M  M  2  1011M an evo-
lution from   180 km s1 at z  0 to  240 km s1 at
16 However as shown in Fig 8 a similar data set actu-
ally appears to indicate no evolution at all The velocity
dispersion at a xed stellar mass of M  1011M rather
than a range stays constant at   210 km s1 between
z  0 and  18 Notice that we only use galaxies with
1075  log10MM  1125 and we convert the mea-
sured value of  at the measured value of M for each galaxy
to that at M  1011M using an empirical relation found
in Fig 6 This prescription largely removes any systematic
error arising from the dierences in the stellar masses of
the galaxies in the dierent redshift bins Another dierence
between the Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 analysis and ours is
that for local galaxies Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 use SDSS
DR6 data to derive stellar masses while we use only SLACS
galaxies for which two independent stellar mass measure-
ments are available based on SDSS Grillo et al 2009 and
HST Auger et al 2009 photometric data
Incidentally all the abundance matching results shown
in Fig 7 imply no or little evolution of z at M  1011M
regardless of the VDF or the SMF used Hence our abun-
dance matching results are in excellent agreement with but
at the same time are not distinguished by our analysis of
of the data from the literature for individual galaxies for
0  z  2 However it is important to notice that none
of the current observational results on the structural evo-
lutions of galaxies indicate a negative evolution in  with
z for any M Observational indications eg stellar mass
densities are such that velocity dispersions cannot be lower
at a higher z in case of evolution Hence according to our
abundance matching results the downsizing SMF is incon-
sistent with the VDF evolution from strong lensing by Chae
2010 because it requires a lower  at a higher z for massive
galaxies
422 Comparison with predictions from cosmological
hydrodynamic simulations
At xed stellar mass cosmological hydrodynamic simula-
tions from the literature also nd slow or little evolutions
of velocity dispersion For example Hopkins et al 2009b
combine dark halo merging with hydrodynamic simulation
results and observed empirical properties of galaxies to nd
little evolutions of z at xed M Fig 8 Hopkins et al
2010 nd slow evolutions through more realistic cosmo-
logical simulations taking into account various eects in-
cluding equal and minor merging adiabatic expansion and
observational eects Fig 8 Cenarro  Trujillo 2009 pre-
dict based on the Hopkins et al 2009b model a somewhat
greater evolution using their analysis of spheroid size evo-
lutions Fig 8 These simulations are broadly consistent
with the constraints from the current data as analysed above
Fig 8 and the abundance matching results Fig 7 in
the sense that the predicted evolutions are slow and can
be made in principle to agree with the observational con-
straints Furthermore Hopkins et al 2009b nd that the
evolution of z at xed M has little sensitivity on M for
109M 6 M 6 1012M These simulation results are con-
sistent with our abundance matching results based on the
non-downsizing SMF but not with the downsizing SMF
Figure 7 The M- relation at z  1 is compared with
that at z  0 inferred from the abundance matching of the
strong lensing constrained evolutions of the VDFs of Chae
2010 and Bernardi et al 2010 with the observed SMFs from
galaxy surveys see the texts in 4 Two SMFs are used the
COSMOS SMF by Ilbert et al 2010 and the Spitzer SMF
by Perez-Gonzalez et al 2008 The blue data points are the
weighted means and their errors thin error bars are dispersions
for mass intervals of 04 dex based on 47 galaxies for 07  z  13
from di Serego Alighieri 2005 and van der Wel et al 2005 All
stellar masses are for the Chabrier IMF
tionary behaviour of a downsizing SMF is dissimilar to that
of the VDF This implies that a downsizing SMF requires
a dierential evolution in the M- relation In particular
according to the downsizing SMF  has to be lower at z  1
than z  0 at xed M  10112114M
Then which of the above cases the non-evolving or the
evolving case of the M- relation would be more consistent
with other independent results on the structural evolutions
of galaxies

To sum up our abundance matching results based on
the non-downsizing SMF are broadly consistent with obser-
vational constraints on the structural evolutions of galax-
ies and cosmological hydrodynamic simulation results How-
ever the downsizing SMF gives a dierential evolution in
M with z that would not be consistent with observa-
tional constraints or simulation results
5 IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CDM
PARADIGM AND GALAXY EVOLUTION
At the heart of the current hierarchical structure forma-
tion theory is the bottom-up build-up of dark matter haloes
Given that galaxies are believed to be born and centered in
those haloes what would be the evolutionary patterns of
galaxies Unlike dark haloes galaxies have two distinctive
properties namely the photometric property and the dy-
namical property Hence there are two evolutionary proper-
ties of galaxies to be considered The star formation history
of galaxies gives rise to above all the evolutionary patterns in
the luminosity and stellar mass functions of galaxies Most
cosmological observations have been devoted to the photo-
metric properties Galaxy formation models whether semi-
analytical or hydrodynamical have also tried to reproduce
the photometric properties rich in observational data No-
tice that dark haloes do not have such photometric proper-
ties This means that connections between the photometric
properties of galaxies and dark haloes are indirect and chal-
lenging Galaxy evolution in its dynamical property which
is the focus of this work may be characterized by the evo-
lutionary patterns in the velocity dispersion functions of
galaxies One may wonder whether the dynamical property
of galaxies may be more intimately linked to dark haloes
than the photometric properties do How is the dynamical
property of galaxy evolution related to dark haloes What
would be the role of the photometric property of galaxy evo-
lution in this context
Current galaxy formation models cannot yet reliably
predict central dynamical properties of galaxies In this work
we have compared the lensing-constrained evolution of the
VDF with the CDM predicted evolution of the HMF and
the observed evolution of the SMF The main result is that
the halo virial mass Mvir the galaxy stellar mass M
and the central line-of-sight stellar velocity dispersion 
are positively coevolving for the probed redshift range of
0  z  1 What are the implications of the results from this
work for galaxy formation and evolution under the CDM
hierarchical paradigm
Halo mass-velocity dispersion relation We nd that
Mvir- relation does not evolve between z  1 and z  0
Fig 4 for the entire probed range of halo mass from galac-
tic haloes to cluster haloes This empirical nding is insen-
sitive to the choice of the HMF and the VDF from current
simulations and observations under a concordance CDM
cosmological model
Pure dark halo simulations predict that a halo of mass
Mvir at z  1 is smaller ie smaller Rvir but less concen-
trated ie smaller cvir than that at z  0 As to the central
velocity dispersion the two eects are opposite so that we
may expect Mvir to evolve little as far as pure haloes
are concerned Let us consider this quantitatively using a
simple model Without dissipational galaxy formation the
evolution of the central velocity dispersion would be primar-
ily determined by the evolutions of the virial mass Mvir
the virial radius rvir and the concentration cvir The ve-
locity dispersion is expected to increase decrease increase
if Mvir rvir cvir increases while the other two parameters
are held constant Cosmological N -body simulations predict
that all three parameters ie Mvir rvir and cvir increase as
cosmic time evolves forward Suppose   vvirf cvir rrvir
where  is the velocity dispersion in the central region eg
within 001rvir vvir  pGMvirrvir is the circular velocity
at the virial radius and f cvir rrvir is a model-dependent
factor relating the two N -body simulations show that Mvir
rvir and cvir all increase roughly by a factor of 2 from z  1
to 0 see eg Wechsler et al 2002 Then vvir stays roughly
constant and f cvir rrvir increases by about 15 from
z  1 to 0 for an isotropic NFW model see Lokas  Mamon
2001 Hence we expect some enhancement in the velocity
dispersion ie a positive coevolution in the course of the
hierarchical growth of a pure dark halo from z  1 to 0
For realistic haloes hosting dissipationally formed
galaxies hydrodynamic simulations can be used to pre-
dict the evolution of Mvir Unfortunately current hy-
drodynamic simulations do not predict robustly the bary-
onic eects on halo structures eg Blumenthal et al 1986
Gnedin et al 2004 Abadi et al 2009 Tissera et al 2010
Feldmann et al 2010 Specically recent hydrodynamic
simulations overpredict  at a given Mvir eg Tissera et al
2010 Feldmann et al 2010
The nding that the Mvir- relation does not evolve
for 0 6 z 6 1 oers new insights into galaxy formation
and evolution It implies that the dynamical property of the
central galaxy of a halo has little to do with its history but
is dictated by the nal halo virial mass at least since z 
1 Remarkably this is the case for all haloes probed with
  100 km s1 Implications of this nding are discussed
below in the context of the coevolution of Mvir  and M
Stellar mass-velocity dispersion relation The M- re-
lation at z  0 shows a power-law relation M  SM
with a varying power-law index SM ranging from 29 44
for M  10115M to 2029 for M  10105M Let us
compare the M- relation with power-law correlations be-
tween luminosity and internal velocity parameter namely
the Tully-Fisher relation for the late-type population and
the Faber-Jackson relation for the early-type population
The observed Tully-Fisher relation exponent TF lies be-
tween 25 and 35 see 23 or Pizagno et al 2007 The tra-
ditional value for the Faber-Jackson exponent FJ for early-
type galaxies is  4 However an extensive analysis of SDSS
DR5 early-type galaxies reveals that FJ varies systemati-
cally from 27  02 at L to 46  04 at the upper luminos-
ity end Choi et al 2007 see also Desroches et al 2007
The abundance matching M- relation for all galaxies
can match well these Faber-JacksonTully-Fisher relations
in conjunction with measured ML ratios eg Bell et al
In Fig 7 the M- relation at z  1 is compared with
that at z  0 based on two VDFs and two SMFs that are
meant to encompass the current range of observations As
can be seen in the gure the implied evolution depends
sensitively on the adopted SMF and to a less degree on the
adopted VDF The relation based on the COSMOS SMF is
Coevolution of galaxies and dark haloes
consistent with zero evolution in M between z  1 and
0 On the other hand the relation based on the Spitzer SMF
a typical downsizing SMF implies a dierential evolution
in M for M  1011M the implied evolution in 
with redshift at xed M is negative while it is positive for
M  1011M This means that based on the downsizing
SMF a galaxy at z  1 would have a shallower steeper
mass prole than the local counterpart of the same stellar
mass for M  1011M M  1011M
How the above results on the evolution in M are
compared with other independent results on the structural
evolutions of galaxies First of all we nd little evolution in
z at M  1011M for 0  z  18 from a careful analy-
sis of the data in the literature see Fig 8 This is in excel-
lent agreement with the above abundance matching results
However it cannot unfortunately distinguish the abundance
matching results because M  1011M happens to be the
critical mass for the downsizing SMF at which the evolution
changes the sign Second many observational studies nd a
negative size evolution of galaxies with redshift implying a
more steeply declining stellar mass prole at a higher z eg
Trujillo et al 2007 van der Wel et al 2008 Cimatti et al
2008 van Dokkum et al 2008 However more recent stud-
ies nd that stellar mass density proles of the inner regions
up to several kilo-parsecs are consistent with no evolution for
massive galaxies with M  1011M Hopkins et al 2009a
Bezanson et al 2009 According to these studies however
it is not clear whether stellar mass density proles evolve
beyond the inner regions Whatever the case these results
can only imply a similar or larger  at xed M at a higher
redshift contradicting the abundance matching results based
on the downsizing SMF
What do hydrodynamic simulations predict on the evo-
lution of the relation between M and  Hopkins et al
2009b combine galaxy merging with hydrodynamic sim-
ulation to nd a little evolution of  with z at xed M for
any 109M 6 M 6 1012M In particular Hopkins et al
2009b explicitly predict that the M- relation evolves lit-
tle between z  1 and 0 Hopkins et al 2010 take into
account a number of possible eects in their cosmological
simulations and nd slow evolutions of  with z These re-
sults are consistent with the evolution in M with z based
on the COSMOS SMF but not with the downsizing SMF
VDF evolution concord or conict with observed galaxy
evolutions We have already compared the evolving VDF
with the evolving HMF and the evolving SMF We nd that
the evolutions of the HMF the VDF and the SMF appear
concordant but that the downsizing SMF is disfavoured
because its implied structural evolutions are unlikely It is
clearly worthwhile to put the VDF evolution in a broader
context of recent cosmological observations on galaxy evo-
lutions
The lensing constrained VDF evolutions show that
the number density of massive early-type galaxies  
220 km s1 not only evolves signicantly but also shows
a dierential evolution see Fig 1 the higher the ve-
locity dispersion the faster the number density evolu-
tion the velocity-upsizing behaviour probably mean-
ing an mass-upsizing behaviour ie the behaviour of
more massive galaxies assembling later in cosmic time
Matsuoka  Kawara 2010 has just recently compiled a
large number  60 000 of massive galaxies M 
10 K-H Chae
1011M over a large sky area 552 deg2 from the UKIRT
Infrared Deep Sky Survey UKIDSS and the SDSS II Super-
nova Survey Matsuoka  Kawara 2010 nd a signicantly
greater number density evolution for M  10115M than
M  10115M out to z  1 consistent with the hierarchical
evolution The parallel evolution of the VDF and the SMF
would imply no evolution in the total mass prole of galax-
ies Indeed strong lens modelling Koopmans et al 2006
Saha et al 2007 Winn et al 2004 Treu  Koopmans 2002
and velocity dispersion measurements to a high redshift
Fig 8 support non-evolution in total mass proles even
if stellar mass proles evolve Galaxy merging is an inde-
pendent route to probe the build-up of galaxies over cosmic
time eg White et al 2007 Masjedi et al 2008 Wake et al
2008 de Ravel et al 2009 Bundy et al 2009 The mere
fact that thousands of merging events have been observed
is the evidence for some sort of hierarchical mass assembly
going on The issue is the merging rate and its dependence
on galaxy mass Observed merging rates are at variance and
cannot test the hierarchical assembly of massive galaxies ro-
bustly It is however worth noting the more recent result
by Bundy et al 2009 that merging rate is greater for mas-
sive galaxies with M  1011M than less massive galaxies
The Bundy et al 2009 result is in line with the hierarchi-
cal mass assembly and agrees qualitatively with the VDF
evolution
Coevolution of Mvir  and M and implications for
the CDM paradigm In the above discussions we have con-
sidered the connections of  with Mvir and M separately
The results that  is coevolving in parallel with both Mvir
and M necessarily imply a similar coevolution of Mvir and
M Fig 9 shows the abundance matching Mvir-M rela-
tions at z  0 and z  1 The results based on the COS-
MOS SMF give little evolution in the Mvir-M relation for
Mvir  1012M implying a parallel coevolution of Mvir and
M with cosmic time This is consistent with the little evo-
lutions in the Mvir- and the M- relations based on the
same SMF Hence we are left with the simple picture that
Mvir M and  are all coevolving so that a halo of given
mass  1012M has on average the same stellar mass and
the same stellar velocity dispersion for its central galaxy in-
dependent of redshift for 0  z  1 Some indications of
evolution in the Mvir-M relation and possibly in the M-
relation for Mvir  1012M may imply a dierential evolu-
tion among Mvir M and  We cannot address this issue
for low-mass haloes here because the strong lensing con-
strained VDF evolution from this work breaks down at low
 The results based on the downsizing Spitzer SMF give
a mild dierential evolution in the Mvir-M relation at large
masses5 as it is the case for M- relation However in the
above we have argued that a downsizing SMF is unlikely
How the parent dark halo is dynamically related to the
residing galaxy as a function of cosmic time is a fundamen-
tal question for galaxy formation and evolution In this work
we have studied the connection of the halo mass Mvir with
the stellar velocity dispersion  and the stellar mass M
of the central galaxy for 0  z  1 According to our results
5 Given the observational uncertainty of the Spitzer SMF at
z  1 it is only marginally inconsistent with zero evolution see
Behroozi et al 2010
the stellar dynamics in the galaxy characterized by  is
closely linked to the parent halo mass Mvir independent of
redshift for 0  z  1 A link between the central parti-
cle velocity dispersion and Mvir is expected in the CDM
paradigm because it predicts on average a universal den-
sity prole independent of Mvir eg Navarro et al 2004
2010 and references theirin along with well-dened scal-
ing relations of the structural parameters with Mvir eg
Bullock et al 2001 Maccio et al 2007 Klypin et al 2010
According to the coevolution dissipational baryonic physics
involving star formation that may have modied the central
potential of the halo has not destroyed but appears to have
rened the link
It is then natural to suggest that dissipational baryonic
physics results in on average a rescaled universal or univer-
sal class density prole of the stellar plus dark mass distri-
bution or perhaps more realistically a universal class den-
sity prole of dark matter combined with a well-correlated
class of stellar mass distribution What would then the
baryon-modied universal class density prole look like
The observation that the inner density prole of the galaxy
plus halo system is on average close to isothermal see Chae
2010 for a review and references combined with the expecta-
tion that baryonic eects are not likely to be important well
outside the scale radii eg Gnedin et al 2004 Abadi et al
2009 Tissera et al 2010 leads us to suggest a modied or
generalized NFW GNFW prole in which the inner total
density prole is close to isothermal with a possible system-
atic variation with Mvir while the NFW prole is kept at
large radii well outside the stellar mass distributions The
GNFW prole is then in an average sense preserved in the
successive merging of GNFWs Furthermore the evolution
of the concentration of such an GNFW prole with z at
xed Mvir conspires with the evolution of the virial radius
rvir with z to lead to a non-varying  with z It is not well
understood at present whether this is just a coincidence or a
revelation of a fundamental mechanism in galaxy formation
and evolution It is also not clear whether the non-evolving
Mvir relation extends to a higher redshift ie since when
the HMF and the VDF have been coevolving in parallel in
cosmic history
The observation that the amount of star forma-
tion ie stellar mass M is correlated with Mvir eg
Conroy  Wechsler 2009 Moster et al 2009 Guo et al
2009 Behroozi et al 2010 is consistent with the above pic-
ture Namely a larger halo undergoes a larger amount of
star formation needed to modify the greater potential well
If M were perfectly correlated with  at xed Mvir the
correlation between Mvir and  would be just a by-product
of the Mvir-M correlation However although there is some
good correlation between M and  for all galaxies ie re-
gardless of their haloes the correlation between M and 
at xed Mvir is weaker in preparation Hence under the
above picture the Mvir   correlation is originated from
the CDM haloes and the amount of star formation set by
Mvir rescales the correlation We then expect some correla-
tion between M and  at xed Mvir because the boost of
 depends on the degree of the baryonic eects on the halo
characterized by M in preparation
Let us compare the coevolution and the above picture
motivated by it with some pictures or interpretations and
numerical simulation results of the CDM paradigm that
Coevolution of galaxies and dark haloes
model must predict correctly the evolution of the galaxy
properties Semi-analytic models of galaxy formation have
paid much attention on the galaxy luminosity and stellar
mass functions The current generation of these models can
reproduce the z  0 functions reasonably well but fail to
match their observed evolutions see eg Fontanot et al
2009 Stringer et al 2009 Cattaneo et al 2008
The galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions have
much to do with the complex baryonic physics of star for-
mations AGN activities feedbacks etc Hence the evolu-
tions of the galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions
can only provide indirect tests of the underlying CDM
paradigm The stellar velocity or velocity dispersion of the
galaxy residing in the centre of a halo probes the grav-
itational potential of the baryon plus dark matter sys-
tem Since the dark halo is expected to be modied in
the course of the dissipational galaxy formation process
eg Blumenthal et al 1986 Gnedin et al 2004 Rudd et al
2008 Abadi et al 2009 Tissera et al 2010 and the central
potential is likely to be dominated by the baryonic matter
the velocity dispersion function evolution itself is not a
direct probe of the CDM paradigm either However the
velocity dispersion function is separated from much of the
baryonic physics but has only to do with its dynamical ef-
fect Hence once the dynamical eect of galaxy formation
is well accounted for the evolution of the velocity dis-
persion function oers an useful complementary probe of
the structure formation theory While it is challenging to
measure reliably the evolution of the velocity dispersion
function through conventional galaxy surveys strong lens-
ing statistics in a well-dened survey provides an excellent
opportunity to constrain the evolution of the velocity dis-
persion function through the image splitting distributions
see Chae 2010 Current strong lensing statistics is limited
by the small sample size However future cosmological sur-
veys including but not limited to the Dark Energy Sur-
vey the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and the Square
Kilometre Array will increase dramatically the number of
strong lenses see Oguri  Marshall 2010 allowing to put
tight constraints on the evolution of velocity dispersion
functions
6 CONCLUSIONS
Through an abundance matching analysis of the lensing con-
strained VDF evolution along with the theoretical HMF and
the observed SMF from galaxy surveys we nd the follow-
i The dark halo virial mass-central stellar velocity dis-
persion Mvir- relation at z  0 is in excellent agree-
ment with the observed properties of low-redshift individual
haloes
ii The stellar mass-central stellar velocity dispersion
M- relation at z  0 is consistent with the local scaling
relations of galaxies in the literature
iii The Mvir- relation does not evolve between z  1
and 0 independent of current observation and simulation
iv The M- relation does not evolve between z  1
and 0 for the COSMOS SMF This is well in line with the
observed non-evolution of  with z at M  1011M This

have been discussed in the literature First the continual
growth of the central stellar velocity dispersion and the
stellar mass accompanying the growth of the halo over cos-
mic time would be inconsistent with a strictly stable core
concept for massive galaxies eg Loeb  Peebles 2003
Gao et al 2004 even after z  1 However the growth
slopes for  and M are shallower for more massive haloes
according to the abundance matching results see Fig 4
and Fig 9 Hence a weakly evolving core of massive haloes
would be consistent with our results Second the picture
shares the concept of universal density prole with the
attractor hypothesis eg Loeb  Peebles 2003 Gao et al
2004 However there is a clear distinction between the two
The attractor hypothesis assumes that the universal NFW
prole is preserved or restored in hierarchical merging of
haloes hosting galaxies while the present picture assumes
that the baryon-modied universal total density prole ie
the GNFW prole is preserved once it is created The lat-
ter property is supported by dissipationless merging simu-
lations eg Boylan-Kolchin  Ma 2004 Kazantzidis et al
2006 Nipoti et al 2009
Test of the CDM paradigm The basic tenet of the
CDM structure formation theory is the hierarchical mass
assembly What the theory predicts is the distribution of
dark matter haloes Connecting observed galaxies with the-
oretical dark haloes is a major goal of cosmological research
The diculty of testing the CDM paradigm arises from
the complex physics of galaxy formation within the halo
and the induced modication of the halo structure A nec-
essary condition for a successful model is to reproduce the
basic statistical properties of the observed local Universe
such as the luminosity stellar mass and velocity functions
of galaxies and their correlations see Trujillo-Gomez et al
2010 However a successful reproduction of the z  0 sta-
tistical properties of galaxies is not sucient A successful
12 K-H Chae
is also consistent with the predicted little or mild evolution
of  with z insensitive to M from cosmological simulations
However the Spitzer SMF a typical downsizing SMF re-
quires the M- relation to evolve in a dierential way that
is not supported by independent observational results on the
structural evolutions of galaxies in the literature
v The non-evolution in the Mvir- and the M- rela-
tions imply a parallel coevolution of Mvir M and  between
z  1 and 0 This is corroborated by the little evolution in
the abundance matching Mvir-M relation between z  1
and 0 for Mvir  1012M
vi The parallel coevolution of Mvir  and M with z

APPENDIX A INTRINSIC SCATTERS AND
BIAS CORRECTIONS FOR THE ABUNDANCE
MATCHING RELATIONS
This work is concerned with the abundance matching AM
relations between  and Mvir and between  and M The
AM is intended to recover the true median relation If there
were not any intrinsic scatter in the relation between two
parameters the AM by equation 2 of two statistical func-
tions would recover the true relation exactly In reality the
distribution of two observables in a plane has intrinsic scat-
ters around the median relation When there are such in-
trinsic scatters the AM by equation 2 will give a biased
median relation that is dierent from the true median rela-
tion Here we estimate the bias and correct the AM relation
by equation 2 to obtain the corrected relation The bias-
corrected AM relation is then checked for self-consistency
through a Monte-Carlo simulation In other words we esti-
mate the bias so that the corrected relation reproduces from
one statistical function to the other through a Monte-Carlo
simulation based on the intrinsic scatter
For our purpose a knowledge of the intrinsic scatter
is required There has been no measurement or simula-
tion for the intrinsic scatter in the Mvir- relation On
the other hand there have been measurements for the
relation between M and  eg Desroches et al 2007
Hyde  Bernardi 2009 Shankar et al 2010 Hence we
study rst the M- relation using a model intrinsic scat-
ter motivated from observed intrinsic scatters We then give

by Bernardi et al 2010 based on SDSS DR6 and data points
realised by a Monte-Carlo simulation Right panel The black
curve is the VDF measured by Bernardi et al 2010 for  
125 km s1 based on SDSS DR6 The data points and green curve
are the results of a Monte-Carlo simulation based on the bias-
corrected AM relation and the intrinsic scatter shown in Fig A2
The red curve is the simulation result based on the biased AM
relation shown in Fig A2
some results on the Mvir- relation that come from a pro-
cedure to simultaneously derive an intrinsic scatter and the
bias-corrected Mvir- relation by considering a bivariate dis-
tribution of M and  as a function of Mvir in preparation
Studies on the eects of the intrinsic scatters in the Mvir-
M and the Mvir-L relations can be found respectively in
Behroozi et al 2010 and Tasitsiomi et al 2004
For the purpose of demonstration we use the SDSS SMF
and VDF by Bernardi et al 2010 that are displayed in
Fig A1 For the intrinsic scatter of V  log10 km s1 as
a function of m log10MM we adopt a linear model
given by 0115  0039  m  10 that is derived from the
Desroches et al 2007 measurements of early-type galax-
ies for m  104 and are consistent with the measurements
by Hyde  Bernardi 2009 and Shankar et al 2010 For
all galaxies including late-type galaxies the intrinsic scat-
ter will be more complicated than this In this work we do
not attempt to consider an intrinsic scatter distribution for
all galaxies for the following two reasons First there have
not been any published measurement results of the intrin-
sic scatter for all galaxies Second the intrinsic scatter for
early-type galaxies will match that for all galaxies at large
stellar masses where the bias in AM is most signicant In
other words we can reliably estimate the greatest bias in
AM using only the intrinsic scatter for early-type galaxies
Fig A2 shows the biased red curve and the bias-
corrected green curve AM relations The dashed curves
around the bias-corrected AM relation represent the adopted
intrinsic scatter described above Fig A1 shows the input
VDF and the Monte-Carlo simulated VDFs from the in-
put SMF based on the biased and bias-corrected AM re-
lations and the adopted intrinsic scatter Notice that for
the bias-corrected AM relation the simulated VDF closely
matches the input VDF Hence the required self-consistency
is gained If we use dierent input SMFs and VDFs we will
Figure A2 Upper panel Red curve is the AM relation given
by equation 2 for the SMF and the VDF shown in Fig A1 while
green curve is an adjusted relation Green dashed curves rep-
resent 1 dispersion assuming a gaussian distribution of V 
log10 km s1 Data points have been realized from the SMF
using the adjusted relation and the adopted scatter A VDF de-
rived from these simulated data points matches nearly perfectly
the input VDF The adjusted relation is referred to as the bias-
corrected relation in the texts Lower panel The dierence be-
tween the initial AM relation equation 2 and the adjusted rela-
tion referred to as the AM bias Red curve is that for the upper
panel Other curves are for the following input SMFs and VDFs

SMF 4 gray solid - Bernardi VDFCOSMOS SMF 5 gray
dashed - Bernardi VDFSpitzer SMF 6 gray dotted - Bernardi
VDFBernardi SMF identical to the red curve
of course get dierent AM biases Several biases required for
the z  0 SMFs and VDFs used in this work can be found
in the bottom panel of Fig A2 To estimate the biases re-
quired for the z  1 functions we use the predicted VDFs at
z  1 based on the best-t evolution parameters from strong
lensing statistics along with the observed z  1 SMFs The
magnitude of the biases for z  1 is about the same as that
for z  0 and we do not display the z  1 biases
The same procedure would be followed for the Mvir-
relation if there were an observational intrinsic scatter as
for the M- relation above Without a knowledge of the in-
trinsic scatter for the Mvir- relation we devise a procedure
that allows us to derive simultaneously the intrinsic scatter
and the median relation for Mvir and  in preparation
A full description of the procedure is beyond the scope of
this paper and the reader is referred to a following paper
in preparation Here we only give a brief description of the
procedure and quote a simple result The idea is to use a
bivariate distribution of M and  at xed Mvir noticing
that M and  are expected to be correlated Then we de-
termine simultaneously the scatter of  and the correlation
coecient between M and  given the observed scatter of
M at xed Mvir so that the resulting M- relation is con-
sistent with the given relation based on observations The
results depend on the input scatter of M and the input M-
 relation Fig 4 shows a simple result based on a standard
deviation of 016 for log10M at xed Mvir and the above
described M- relation based on the Bernardi et al 2010
observational results
APPENDIX B THE vvir-vopt RELATION AT
Dutton et al 2010 constrain the relation between vvir and
vopt through combining observationally derived M-Mvir
and M-vopt relations vvir and vopt are the circular rotation
velocities at the virial and the optical radii respectively
The abundance matching Mvir- relation from this work
may be transformed into a vvir-vopt relation using an em-
pirical relation between vopt and  The virial velocity vvir
is given by Bryan  Norman 1998
is dened by pGMvirrvir where the virial radius at z  0
rvir  209h1cid18 Mvir
1012h1Mcid1913
for the adopted cosmology and we take h  07
For early-type elliptical and lenticular galaxies the
direct estimate of vopt ranges from  2 to  17 eg
Courteau et al 2007 Ho 2007 Pizzella et al 2005 Ferrarese
2002 For late-type galaxies the Chae 2010 late-type VDF
has actually been transformed from a circular velocity func-
tion VF assuming vopt  2 Hence we can transform
the Chae 2010 late-type VDF back to the original VF using
the same factor The Bernardi et al 2010 VDF is a directly
measured function based on SDSS spectroscopy It is impor-
tant to note that the SDSS measured velocity dispersions
for late-type galaxies with small bulges or without bulges
come mostly from rotational motions M Bernardi private
communications meaning that these small-bulge bulge-
less systems are not missed in the Bernardi et al 2010
VDF Hence we need an independent knowledge of vopt
for SDSS galaxies to transform the Bernardi et al 2010
VDF to a VF Without a measured value of vopt for SDSS
galaxies we must resort to other measurements From the
literature we nd vopt  14  2 for late-type galaxies
depending on the bulge-to-disk ratio eg Courteau et al
2007 Ho 2007 Pizzella et al 2005 Ferrarese 2002
Based on these literature values of vopt for early- and
late-type galaxies we adopt a range of vopt  2  17
independent of galaxy type to estimate the circular velocity
function of galaxies and then the vvir-vopt relation through
abundance matching Fig B1 shows the likely range of
the median value for voptvvir as a function of vvir Com-
pared with Fig 5 of Dutton et al 2010 our results for
massive galaxies vvir  1023  200 km s1 overlap with
the Dutton et al 2010 results for early-type galaxies For
Coevolution of galaxies and dark haloes
Figure B1 The relation between the halo circular velocity at
the virial radius vvir and the stellar circular velocity in the op-
tical region vopt of the central galaxy at z  0 inferred from
the abundance matching relation between Mvir halo virial mass
and  central stellar velocity dispersion from the VDF and the
CDM halo mass function see the texts in 32 The solid and
dashed curves are respectively based on the VDFs by Chae 2010
and Bernardi et al 2010 For each set of the results the lower
and upper curves are respectively based on vopt  2 and
vopt  17
vvir  1023 km s1 our results give a scaling of vopt  v
with   03  04 This scaling is consistent with previous
results for massive galaxies based on strong lensing statis-
tics and other methods see Chae et al 2006 and references
theirin
However our results for less massive galaxies vvir 
1023 km s1 give systematically higher median values of
voptvvir compared with the Dutton et al 2010 results
for late-type galaxies although the estimated intrinsic scat-
ters not shown here overlap Our results are consistent
with declining rotation curves near the virial radii for late-
type galaxies while the Dutton et al 2010 results imply
at rotation curves right up to the virial radii The pos-
sible discrepancy may imply some unidentied systematic
errors in one or both of the results For our results the
possible sources of systematic errors include the adopted
VDFs and the adopted relation between  and vopt In or-
der to be consistent with the Dutton et al 2010 results
the number densities of galaxies would have to be signif-
icantly lower at relatively low velocity dispersions We use
two independently determined VDFs ie the Chae 2010 and
Bernardi et al 2010 VDFs and they give similar results for
voptvvir In fact the adopted Bernardi et al 2010 VDF is
the modied Schechter t result for   125 km s1 This
VDF gives an underestimate of galaxy number densities at
low  according to Bernardi et al 2010 data Hence if we
were using the raw galaxy number densities the discrep-
ancy with the Dutton et al 2010 results would get worse
at low  The adopted range vopt  2  17 is suggested
16 K-H Chae
by a broad range of observations A possible cause of error
may be that bulgeless late-type galaxies have vopt  17
so that we need to adjust the overall value higher How-
ever if we adopted vopt  17 the discrepancy with the
Dutton et al 2010 results would get worse
