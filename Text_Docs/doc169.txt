ABSTRACT
We investigate the nature of stellar populations of major galaxy mergers
between late-type spirals considerably abundant in interstellar medium by
performing numerical simulations designed to solve both the dynamical and
chemical evolution in a self-consistent manner We particularly consider that the
star formation history of galaxy mergers is a crucial determinant for the nature
of stellar populations of merger remnants and therefore investigate how the
dierence in star formation history between galaxy mergers aects the chemical
evolution of galaxy mergers We found that the rapidity of star formation
which is dened as the ratio of the dynamical time-scale to the time-scale of gas
consumption by star formation is the most important determinant for a number
of fundamental characteristics of stellar populations of merger remnants Main
results obtained in this study are the following ve 1 A galaxy merger with
more rapid star formation becomes elliptical with larger mean metallicity This
is primarily because in the merger with more rapid star formation a smaller
amount of metal-enriched gas is tidally stripped away during merging and
consequently a larger amount of the gas can be converted to stellar component
This result demonstrates that the origin of the color-magnitude relation of
elliptical galaxies can be closely associated with the details of merging dynamics
which depends on the rapidity of star formation in galaxy mergers 2 Negative
metallicity gradient tted reasonably well by power-low can be reproduced by
dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation The magnitude of metallicity
gradient is larger for an elliptical galaxy formed by galaxy merging with less
rapid star formation 3 Absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates
with that of age gradient in galaxy mergers in the sence that a merger remnant
with steeper negative metallicity gradient is more likely to show steeper age
 3 
gradient 4 The outer part of stellar populations is both older and less
metal-enriched than nuclei in an elliptical galaxy formed by galaxy merging with
less rapid star formation Moreover the metallicity of the outer part of gaseous
component for some models with less rapid star formation is appreciably smaller
than that of stellar one This result implies that the origin of metal-poor hot
gaseous X-ray halo in real elliptical galaxies can be essentially ascribed to the
dynamics of dissipative galaxy merging 5 Irrespectively of the rapidity of star
formation the epoch of galaxy merging aects both the mean stellar metallicity
and mean stellar age of merger remnants Later galaxy mergers are more
likely to become ellipticals with both younger and more metal-enriched stellar
populations This result reects the fact that in the later mergers a larger
amount of more metal-enriched interstellar gas is preferentially converted into
younger stars in the later star formation triggered by galaxy merging These ve
results clearly demonstrate that even the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies
can be strongly aected by the details of dynamical evolution of galaxy merging
which is furthermore determined by the rapidity of star formation of galaxy
mergers In particular tidal stripping of interstellar gas and total amount of
gaseous dissipation during galaxy merging are demonstrated to play a vital role
in determining a number of chemical properties of merger remnants Based upon
these results we adopt a specic assumption of the luminosity dependence of
the rapidity of star formation and thereby discuss how successfully the present
merger model can reproduce a number of fundamental chemical photometric
and spectroscopic characteristics of elliptical galaxies

Introduction
Elliptical galaxies have been generally considered to be old coeval and homogeneous
systems passively evolving after the single initial burst of star formation associated with
dissipative galaxy formation This classical picture of elliptical galaxy formation appears to
have been supported by the considerably tight color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies
 Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992 Ellis et al 1997 and by relatively smaller redshift evolution
of photometric properties of elliptical galaxies Aragon-Salamanca et al 1993 Franx 
van Dokkum 1996 A growing number of recent observational results however shed a
strong doubt on this long-standing view of elliptical galaxy formation and suggest that
there is great variety of star formation history between elliptical galaxies such as the epoch
of major star formation the duration and eciency of star formation Worthey Faber 
Gonzalez 1992 Matteuchi 1994 Faber et al 1995 Bender 1996 Worthey Trager  Faber
1996 This tendency that elliptical galaxies show diversity in star formation history and
nevertheless can actually keep the tightness of the color-magnitude relation is considered
to be quite mysterious and thus to provide any theoretical models with a valuable insight
on the elliptical galaxy formation Such kind of mysterious nature observed in elliptical
galaxies is demonstrated to hold equally for the dynamical and kinematical properties of
elliptical galaxies For example considerably small thickness of the fundamental plane of
elliptical galaxies implies a rather smaller range of admitted dynamical state of the galaxies
Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Dressler et al 1987  Djorgovski Pahre  de Carvalho 1996
whereas the morphological dichotomy between boxy-disky elliptical galaxies Kormendy 
Bender 1996 and the projected density prole systematically departing from de Vaucouleurs
R14 law Caon Capaccioli  DOnofrio 1993 show a great variety of major orbit families
consisting the galaxies These fundamental characteristics that elliptical galaxies show both
diversity and uniformity in their chemical photometric and dynamical properties have
imposed some stringent but valuable constraints on any theoretical models of elliptical
 5 
galaxy formation What is the most vital in challenging the origin of elliptical galaxy
formation in this kind of situation is to investigate whether or not both the chemical and
photometric properties and dynamical and kinematical ones can be reproduced successfully
by a specic model of galaxy formation in a reasonably self-consistent manner The previous
theoretical models addressing this important issue on elliptical galaxy formation are divided
basically into two categories The dissipative galactic collapse model eg Larson 1976
Carlberg 1984 and the galaxy merger model eg Toomre  Toomre 1972 As is suggested
by Kormendy  Sanders 1992 these two dominant and apparently competing scenarios
for elliptical galaxy formation are now converging thus it would be crucial to construct
one more realistic and sophisticated model of elliptical galaxy formation Although there
are a large number of important studies exploring the origin of elliptical galaxy formation
along the dissipative collapse scenario especially in the context of the nature of stellar
populations eg Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 we here restrict ourselves to the merger scenario
of elliptical galaxy formation
Recent extensive studies of merger models of elliptical galaxy formation mostly based
upon numerical simulations appear to have succeeded in resolving most of the outstanding
problems related to dynamical and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies such as
the phase space density Ostriker 1980 Carlberg 1986 and kinematical misalignment
Franx Illingworth  de Zeeuw 1991 Barnes 1992 by invoking the inclusion of bulge
component gaseous dissipation and multiplicity of galaxy merging Hernquist Spergel 
Heyl 1993 Weil  Hernquist 1996 Barnes  Hernquist 1996 Although it would be safe
to say that the galaxy merging between two late-type spirals is one of the most promising
candidates explaining more clearly the origin of elliptical galaxies at least in the context
of the dynamical and kinematical properties however there still remain a number of
unresolved and apparently serious problems concerning the merger model eg van den
Bergh 1995 One of the most crucial problems among these is on whether the fundamental
 6 
characteristics of stellar populations of elliptical galaxies can be reproduced reasonably well
by galaxy merging between two late-types spirals Surprisingly there are only a few works
addressing this critical issue for the merger model probably because it is considered to
be rather dicult to solve the chemical evolution of galaxy mergers in which a number of
competing physical processes are expected to aect strongly the chemical evolution of galaxy
mergers White 1980 and Mihos  Hernquist 1994 found that the stellar populations of
progenitor disks are not mixed so well even by the violent relaxation during galaxy merging
and consequently the metallicity gradient of progenitor disks is not so drastically washed
out The metallicity gradient of merger remnant is furthermore found not to be tted by
power law observed in elliptical galaxies Mihos  Hernquist 1994 Schweizer  Seitzer
1992 discussed whether or not the bluer integrated UBV color of elliptical galaxies with
morphologically ne structure can be explained by secondary starburst induced by major
disk-disk galaxy mergers Kaumann  Charlot 1997 construct a semi-analytic model of
elliptical galaxy formation which is based upon the hierarchical clustering in CDM universe
and includes rather simple chemical enrichment process and thereby demonstrate that the
origin of the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be reproduced successfully
even in the CDM model of galaxy formation See also Baugh Cole  Frenk 1996 Thus
since there are only a few works addressing chemical and photometric properties for the
merger model it is essential for the merger model to investigate more throughly the
fundamental chemical and photometric properties of merger remnants including the origin
of color-magnitude relation Faber 1973 Visvanathan  Sandage 1977 age and metallicity

What should be recognized foremost in investigating the nature of stellar populations in
merger remnants is that a glowing number of observational results have been accumulated
which suggest the relatively earlier formation of elliptical galaxies Tightness of the
color-magnitude relation in the cluster of galaxies Bower et al 1992 Ellis et al 1996
relatively smaller photometric evolution of cluster ellipticals Aragon-Salamanca et al
1993 and the redshift evolution of the fundamental plane Franx  van Dokkum 1996
all suggest the typical formation epoch of elliptical galaxies is earlier than 2 in redshift
Furthermore as is suggested by Kormendy  Sanders 1992 the fact that no galaxy in the
K-band survey of Cowie et al 1994 shows the global color resembling that of the Arp 220
which is considered to be ongoing mergers and forming ellipticals implies that the formation
epoch of elliptical galaxies should be earlier than 10 in redshift Silva  Bothun 1997
revealed that the fraction of mass of stellar populations with intermediate age to total mass
in elliptical galaxies with morphologically ne structure is less than 15 percent These
results imply that if elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy merging the epoch of galaxy
merging should be relatively earlier and furthermore that the precursor disks of galaxy
mergers may be extremely abundant in interstellar medium compared with the present
spirals Recent high quality imaging using Hubble Space T elescope HST  has revealed
that a larger number of galaxies at faint magnitude are interactingmerging galaxies eg
van den Bergh et al 1996 indicating furthermore that the potential candidate for elliptical
galaxies formed by galaxy merging are ubiquitous in higher redshift universe Hence it is
quite reasonable and essential to study the nature of stellar populations of higher redshift
galaxy mergers between disk galaxies with the gas mass fraction larger than 02 which
is a typical value of the present late-type spirals and thereby to conrm whether or not
elliptical galaxies can be formed actually by galaxy merging
The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of the stellar populations of a gas-rich
disk merger which is considered to be occurred the most frequently in the high redshift
 8 
universe We particularly investigate how successfully galaxy mergers between gas-rich
spirals can reproduce a number of fundamental chemical photometric and spectroscopic
properties of elliptical galaxies The layout of this paper is as follows In 2 we summarize
numerical models used in the present study and describe in detail methods for analyzing the
stellar populations produced by dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation In 3 we
demonstrate how a number of fundamental characteristics of stellar populations in merger
remnants are aected by the star formation history of dissipative galaxy merging In 4 we
discuss how successfully the present merger model can reproduce a number of observational
results concerning the chemical photometric and spectroscopic properties of elliptical
galaxies In this section we also point out the advantages and disadvantages of galaxy
mergers in explaining both the chemical photometric and spectroscopic properties and
dynamical and kinematical ones in real elliptical galaxies The conclusions of the present
study are given in 5
2 Model
Dynamical evolution of dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation is generally
considered to be highly complex principally because only a smaller amount of interstellar
gas can drastically change the degree of violent relaxation the details of redistribution
of angular momentum in gaseous and stellar component and the total amount of mass
transfered to the central region of merger remnants Barnes  Hernquist 1992 1996
Basically the transfer and mixing of heavy elements ejected from stellar component
are controlled by the above dynamical processes of galaxy merging in a considerably
complicated way we accordingly could not be allowed simply to invoke the Simple one-zone
model in analyzing the chemical and photometric evolution of merging galaxies Thus in
order to analyze the nature of stellar populations produced in such a complex situation
 9 
of dissipative galaxy merging we must solve both dynamical and chemical evolution in a
admittedly self-consistent manner In the present study dynamical evolution of collisional
component interstellar gas and collisionless one dark halo and stars is solved by a
specic N-body method and then a number of characteristics of stellar populations at
given points in the merger remnants are calculated based on the derived information about
the position velocity age and metallicity of each stellar particle Firstly we describe
the numerical model including the initial conditions of the mergers the prescriptions
of dissipative process and the model for star formation in 21 Secondly we give the
method for analyzing the chemical enrichment process during mergers and the photometric
properties of the remnants in 22 Thirdly we describe the main points of analysis of the
present study in 23 Lastly we give values of each parameter in each model in 24
21 Numerical model
Initial conditions
We construct models of galaxy mergers between gas-rich disk galaxies with equal mass
by using Fall-Efstathiou model 1980 The total mass and the size of a progenitor disk
are Md and Rd respectively From now on all the mass and length are measured in units
of Md and Rd respectively unless specied Velocity and time are measured in units of
v  GMdRd12 and tdyn  R3
dGMd12 respectively where G is the gravitational
constant and assumed to be 10 in the present study If we adopt Md  60  1010 M and
Rd  175 kpc as a ducial value then v  121  102 kms and tdyn  141  108 yr
respectively In the present model the rotation curve becomes nearly at at 035 radius
with the maximum rotational velocity vm  18 in our units The corresponding total mass
Mt and halo mass Mh are 38 and 28 in our units respectively The radial R and vertical
Z density prole of a disk are assumed to be proportional to expRR0 with scale length
 10 
R0  02 and to sech2ZZ0 with scale length Z0  004 in our units respectively The
mass density of halo component is truncated at 12 in our units and its velocity dispersion
at a given point is set to be isotropic and given according to the virial theorem In addition
to the rotational velocity made by the gravitational eld of disk and halo component the
initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersion are given to disk component according to
the epicyclic theory with Toomres parameter Binney  Tremaine 1987 Q  10 This
adopted value for Q parameter is appreciably smaller compared with the value required
for stabilizing the initial disk against the non-axisymmetric dynamical instability eg bar
instability The reason for this adoption is that the initial disk is assumed to be composed
mostly of interstellar gas and thus random kinetic energy in the disk is considered to be
rather smaller because of gaseous dissipation in the disk The vertical velocity dispersion at
given radius are set to be 05 times as large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point as
is consistent with the observed trend of the Milky Way eg Wielen 1977 As is described
above the present initial disk model does not include any remarkable bulge component
and accordingly corresponds to purely late-type spiral without galactic bulge Although
it is highly possible that galactic bulges greatly aect the chemical evolution of galaxy
mergers we however investigate this issue in our future papers It could be reasonable
to consider that the present initial disk with a considerably larger amount of interstellar
gas and without pronounced galactic bulges is one of candidates of precursors of typical
elliptical galaxies which are considered to be formed at relatively higher redshift z  2
The collisional and dissipative nature of the interstellar medium is modeled by the
sticky particle method Schwarz 1981 It should be emphasized here that this discrete
cloud model can at best represent the real interstellar medium of galaxies in a schematic
way As is modeled by McKee  Ostriker 1977 the interstellar medium can be considered
to be composed mainly of hot warm and cool gas each of which mutually interacts
hydrodynamically in a rather complicated way Actually these considerably complicated
 11 
nature of interstellar medium in disk galaxies would not be so simply modeled by the
sticky particle method in which gaseous dissipation is modeled by ad hoc cloud-cloud
collision Any existing numerical method probably could not model the real interstellar
medium in an admittedly proper way In the present study as a compromise we only
try to address some important aspects of hydrodynamical interaction between interstellar
medium in disk galaxies and in dissipative mergers More elaborated numerical modeling
for real interstellar medium would be necessary for our further understanding of dynamical
evolution in dissipative galaxy mergers To mimic the galaxy mergers which are occurred
at higher redshift and thus very dissipative because of a considerably larger amount of
interstellar gas in the progenitor disks we assume that the fraction of gas mass in a disk
is set to be 10 initially Actually the gas mass fraction in precursor disks of a merger is
dierent between galaxy mergers and depends on the epoch of the merging Although this
dierence probably could yield a great variety of chemical and dynamical structures in
merger remnants we do not intend to consider this important dierence for simplicity in
the present paper and will address in our future paper The size of the clouds is set to be
35  103 in our units in the present simulations The radial and tangential restitution
coecient for cloud-cloud collisions are set to be 05 and 00 respectively The number
of particles of halo and the gaseous component for an above isolated galaxy are 5000 and
10000 respectively
Numerical simulations of galaxy mergers are divided into two categories in the present
study Pair mergers between two disks with a parabolic encounter and multiple mergers
between ve disks In all of the simulations of pair mergers the orbit of the two disks is
set to be initially in the xy plane and the distance between the center of mass of the two
disks represented by rin is assumed to be the free parameter which controls the epoch of
galaxy merging The pericenter distance represented by rp is also assumed to be the free
parameter which controls the initial total orbital angular momentum of galaxy mergers
 12 
The eccentricity is set to be 10 for all models of pair mergers meaning that the encounter
of galaxy merging is parabolic The spin of each galaxy in a pair merger is specied by
two angle i and i where sux i is used to identify each galaxy i is the angle between
the z axis and the vector of the angular momentum of a disk i is the azimuthal angle
measured from x axis to the projection of the angular momentum vector of a disk on to xy
plane The value of each parameter i i rp and rin for each model is described later In
the simulations of multiple mergers the initial position of each progenitor disk is set to be
distributed randomly within a sphere with radius 60 in our units and the initial velocity
dispersion of each disk that is the random motion of each galaxy in the sphere is set to be
distributed in such a way that the ratio of the total kinematical energy to the total potential
energy in the system is 025 The time when the progenitor disks merge completely and
reach the dynamical equilibrium is less than 150 in our units for most of models and does
not depend so strongly on the history of star formation in the present calculations
212 Global star formation
Star formation is modeled by converting the collisional gas particles into collisionless
new stellar particles according to the algorithm of star formation described below We adopt
the Schmidt law Schmidt 1959 with exponent   20 10    20 Kennicutt 1989 as
the controlling parameter of the rate of star formation The amount of gas consumed by
star formation for each gas particle in each time step
Mg is given as
Mg  CSF  g010
where g and 0 are the gas density around each gas particle and the mean gas density
at 048 radius of an initial disk respectively This star formation model is similar to that
of Mihos Richstone  Bothun 1992 In order to avoid a large number of new stellar
particles with dierent mass we convert one gas particle into one stellar one according to
 13 
the following procedure First we give each gas particle the probability Psf that the gas
Mg in
particle is converted into stellar one by setting the Psf to be proportional to the
equation 1 estimated for the gas particle Then we draw the random number to determine
whether or not the gas particle is totally converted into one new star This method of star
formation enables us to control the rapidity of star formation without increase of particle
number in each simulation thus to maintain the numerical accuracy in each simulation
The CSF in the equation 1 is the parameter that controls the rapidity of gas consumption
by star formation The larger the CSF is the more rapidly the gas particles are converted
to new stellar particles As a result of this total amount of gaseous dissipation is also
controlled by this parameter CSF The more amount of kinetic energy of gas particles is
dissipated away by cloud-cloud collision for the models with smaller CSF This parameter
CSF is meant to be proportional to the ratio of dynamical time-scale of the system to the
time-scale of gas consumption by star formation Furthermore the equation 1 states that
a larger number of stellar particles are created at the regions where the local gas density
become larger owing to the onset of local Jeans instability The positions and velocity of the
new stellar particles are set to be the same as those of original gas particles As is described
above in the present study we do not explicitly include the threshold density of star
formation which is demonstrated to be associated with the growth of local gravitational
instability with relatively smaller wavelength that is the Toomres Q parameter Kennicutt
1989 for isolated disk galaxies This is because the threshold criterion which is derived
only for calmly evolving galactic disks would not so simply be applied to the present
merger model in which the time-scale that the disk can evolve without strong dynamical
perturbation is relatively smaller less than 10 dynamical time for typical models
In the present study we do not intend to include any feedback eects of star formation
such as thermal and dynamical heating of interstellar medium driven by supernovae rstly
because such inclusion could prevent us from deducing more clearly the important roles of
 14 
the rapidity of star formation and secondly because there still remains a great uncertainty
concerning the numerical implementation of the feedback eects Katz 1992 Navarro 
White 1993 Accordingly as is described above the star formation in this preliminary
study only means the formation of collisionless particles and does not literally mean the
actual and realistic series of star formation This kind of modeling for star formation is
rather oversimplied so that we can only address some important aspects of the roles of
star formation in generating chemical and dynamical characteristics of merger remnants
However we believe that since the main points of the present study are only the relatively
global and average characteristics of chemical and photometric properties even the rather
simple model adopted in this study makes it possible to grasp some essential ingredients of
the roles of star formation in producing a number of important characteristics of stellar
populations in merging galaxies More extensive studies on this subject will be done in our
future papers by using more elaborated model for star formation
All the calculations related to the above dynamical evolution including the dissipative
dynamics star formation and gravitational interaction between collisionless and collisional
component have been carried out on the GRAPE board Sugimoto et al 1990 at
Astronomical Institute of Tohoku University The parameter of gravitational softening
is set to be xed at 004 in all the simulations The time integration of the equation of
motion is performed by using 2-order leap-og method Energy and angular momentum are
conserved within 1 percent accuracy in a test collisionless merger simulation Most of the
calculations are set to be stopped at T  250 in our units unless specied
22 Method for analysis of stellar population
Chemical and photometric properties such as global colors and metallicity gradient
in elliptical galaxies depend critically on how the metallicity and age of stellar component
 15 
are distributed in the galaxies Accordingly we rst analyze the distribution of stellar
age and that of stellar metallicity in merger remnant for each model in order to grasp the
characteristics of stellar population in merger remnants In the present study these age and
metallicity distribution are calculated based on the age and metallicity assigned to each
stellar particle as described in detail later The outline for this calculation is as follows
First we derive the distribution of stellar age and that of stellar metallicity by assigning
age and metallicity to stellar particles according as the law of chemical enrichment applied
to this study Next by using the stellar population synthesis method we calculate the
photometric and spectroscopic properties based on the derived distribution of age and
metallicity in merger remnant
221 Chemical enrichment
Chemical enrichment through star formation during galaxy merging is assumed to
proceed both locally and instantaneously in the present study The model for analyzing
metal enrichment of each gas and stellar particle is as follows First as soon as a gas particle
is converted into a new stellar one by star formation we search neighbor gas particles
locating within Rche from the position of the new stellar particle and then count the number
of the neighbor gas particles Ngas This Rche is referred to as chemical mixing length in
the present paper and represents the region within which the neighbor gas particles are
polluted by metals ejected from the new stellar particle The value of Rche relative to the
typical size of a galaxy could be dierent between galaxies accordingly the value of Rche
is considered to be free parameter in the present study The values of Rche examined the
most extensively in the present study are 04 which is slightly smaller than the eective
radius of typical merger remnants in the present study 01 and 002 which is the half of
the gravitational softening length Next we assign the metallicity of original gas particle to
 16 
the new stellar particle and increase the metals of the each neighbor gas particle according
to the following equation about the chemical enrichment
MZ  ZiRmetms  10  Rmet10  ZimsymetNgas
where the MZ represents the increase of metal for each gas particle Zi Rmet ms and
ymet in the above equation represent the metallicity of the new stellar particle or that of
original gas particle the fraction of gas returned to interstellar medium the mass of the
new star and the chemical yield respectively The value of the Rmet and that of ymet are
set to be 03 and 003 respectively Furthermore the time ti when the new stellar particle
is created is assigned to the new stellar particle in order to calculate the photometric
evolution of merger remnants as is described later To verify the accuracy of the above
treatment including numerical code for chemical enrichment process we checked whether
or not the following conservation law of chemical enrichment is satised for each time step
in each test simulation
msZi Xgas
mgZi  ymetXstar
where mg ms and Zi are the mass of each gas particle that of each stellar one and the
metallicity of each particle respectively and the summation P is done for all the gas
particles or stellar ones Strictly speaking the above equation holds when the value of Rmet
is 00 Thus in testing the validity of the present code of chemical enrichment we set the
value of Rmet to be 00 and then perform a simulation for the test We conrmed that the
above equation is nearly exactly satised in our test simulations and furthermore that even
if the Rmet is not 00 the dierence in the value of total metallicity between the left and
right side in the above equation is negligibly small
 17 
222 Population synthesis
It is assumed in the present study that the spectral energy distribution SED of a
model galaxy is a sum of the SED of stellar particles The SED of each stellar particle
is assumed to be a simple stellar population SSP that is a coeval and chemically
homogeneous assembly of stars Thus the monochromatic ux of a galaxy with age T 
FT  is described as
FT   Xstar
FSSPZi i  ms 
where FSSPZi i and ms are a monochromatic ux of SSP of age i and metallicity Zi
where sux i identies each stellar particle and mass of each stellar particle respectively
The age of SSP i is dened as i  T  ti where ti is the time when a gas particle convert
to a stellar one The metallicity of SSP is exactly the same as that of the stellar particle Zi
and the summation P in equation 4 is done for all stellar particles in a model galaxy
A stellar particle is assumed to be composed of stars whose age and metallicity are
exactly the same as those of the stellar particle and the total mass of the stars is set to be
the same as that of the stellar particle Thus the monochromatic ux of SSP at a given
wavelength is dened as
FSSPZi i  Z MU
MfM i ZidM 
where M is mass of a star fM i Zi is a monochromatic ux of a star with mass M
metallicity Zi and age i M is a initial mass function IMF of stars and MU  ML are
upper and lower mass limit of IMF respectively
In this paper we use the FSSPZi i calculated by Tantalo et al 1996 The
characteristics of Tantalo et al 1996s SSP are 1 all evolutionary phase from the main
sequence to the white dwarf or C-ignition stage are included and 2 metallicity Z ranges
from 00004 to 01 and helium content Y  satises the relation Y  25Z  0230 The
 18 
library of stellar spectra calculated by Kurucz 1992 and the following form of the Salpeter
IMF are used in deriving the above FSSPZi i
M 
x  2M x2
MUcid17x2 M x 
1 cid16 ML
where x  235 ML  015M and MU  120M In order to estimate the FSSPZi i
for stellar particles with arbitrary Zi and i we assign interpolated values to each stellar
particle by using a set of data points tabulated in Table 2 of Tantalo et al 1996 The
mean stellar metallicity  Z  used in the present study is dened as
 Z   Xstar
Colors at given radius and radial color gradients are given as follows First we divide the
region ranging from 05 Re to 50 Re of a merger remnant into 20 annulus whose inner and
outer boundary are located at the distance rj and rj1 from the center of the remnant
respectively Then the monochromatic ux emitted from the jth annulus is derived by
summing the FSSPZi i of all the particles locating at rj  Ri  rj1 where Ri is the
distance between the position of each stellar particle and the center of the remnant Color
gradients are calculated by using this monochromatic ux for each annulus
23 Main points of analysis
We consider that the CSF is the most important parameter in the present study
principally because the CSF could depend on galactic luminosity The importance of the CSF
and its possible dependence on galactic luminosity are described in the Appendix section In
what follows we mainly investigate how the rapidity of gas consumption by star formation
CSF can determine a number of fundamental chemical photometric and spectroscopic
properties of merger remnants and thereby observe how successfully the present merger
 19 
model can reproduce the fundamental characteristics of real elliptical galaxies Since the
CSF is considered to depend on galactic luminosity in the present study this investigation
corresponds to addressing indirectly the origin of the luminosity-dependent characteristics
of elliptical galaxies First we investigate the dependence of chemical properties on the CSF
which is the most important parameter in the present study in 31 What we investigate
the most extensively in this investigation are on the mean stellar and gaseous metallicity
radial gradients of metallicity and age shapes of isochrome contour and the formation of
substantially metal-enriched galactic nuclei in merger remnants Second we investigate the
important roles of other four parameters the chemical mixing length orbit conguration
of galaxy merging multiplicity of galaxy merging and the epoch of galaxy merging in
determining the fundamental chemical properties of merger remnants 32 This sort
of multi-parameter study is indispensable for the present study in which initial physical
conditions of galaxy mergers can be variously dierent In this investigation we conrm
whether or not the important roles of the parameter CSF derived in 31 can be equally
seen in the models with dierent chemical mixing length orbit conguration multiplicity
of mergers and merging epoch We also observe how these four parameters modify the
CSF dependence derived in 32 and what fundamental roles the four parameters play in
determining the characteristics of stellar populations Third we investigate the photometric
and spectroscopic properties of merger remnants and their dependence on the galactic
luminosity by adopting a specic relation between the CSF and galactic luminosity and by
assigning the mass and scale to each model with CSF in 33
24 Parameter values of each model
In the present paper totally 29 models are investigated and the parameters and brief
summary of the results are given in Table 1 Each model of galaxy merger is labeled
 20 
for example as Model B1 according to the orbit conguration of galaxy merging and
multiplicity of the merging Most of models 23 models are assigned to pair mergers in
Model B standard models C D E and F and only two are assigned to multiple mergers
in Model G For comparison the isolated evolution of a progenitor disk of a galaxy merger

3 Results
In this section we observe how the star formation history in particular the rapidity
of star formation in galaxy mergers can aect the fundamental characteristics of stellar
populations in mergers remnants Before describing the results of merger remnants we
begin to briey observe the dynamical evolution of an isolated disk galaxy with star
formation which is considered to be a progenitor of a galaxy merger in the present study
and the dependence of star formation history on the parameter CSF in galaxy mergers
Figure 1 gives snapshots of an isolated disk model with CSF  035 Model A1 at T  150
in which about 60 percent of initial gas mass is converted into stellar component within
65 dynamical time In the present isolated disk model a stellar bar suciently develops
in the central region of the disk only after more than 60 percent of initial gas mass has
been consumed by star formation in the disk The developed stellar bar is found to possess
exponential density prole along the major axis of the stellar bar which is the so-called
exponential bar See Elmegreen 1996 for a recent review The initial disk is found to be
heated dynamically in the vertical direction of the disk within 15 dynamical time owing to
the dynamical interaction between the background stars the small gaseous clumps and the
 22 
developed stellar bar Accordingly the present merger model describes the galaxy mergers
between disk galaxies that could be identied with late-type barred galaxies if galaxy
merging had not been occurred Figure 2 is the time evolution of star formation rate fg
for each merger model Model B1 and B5 As is indicated in this gure the star formation
during galaxy merging proceeds in such a way that the interstellar gas is consumed by star
formation more rapidly for the model with larger CSF This trend of star formation holds for
other model sequences Model B  G The CSF dependence of morphology and dynamical
structure in merger remnants is briey summarized in the Appendix section which can help
to understand more deeply the present numerical results By using these models of galaxy
mergers we mainly present the CSF dependence of mean stellar and gaseous metallicity
radial gradients of age and metallicity and the shapes of isophotes and isochromes in the
following subsections

31 Dependence of the chemical properties on the rapidity of star formation
Chemical photometric and spectroscopic properties of galaxies depend basically on
how the metallicity and age of stellar populations of galaxies are distributed Thus we
begin to observe the distribution of metallicity Z and the epoch of star formation T
in the stellar component of merger remnants and its dependence on CSF In this subsection
31 we present the following three results 1 Dependence of Z  T distribution on CSF
2 Dependence of mean Z on CSF and its physical reason and 3 The dierence in the
 23 
metallicity distribution of merger remnants between the Simple one-zone model and the
present chemodynamical one
311 Distribution of stellar populations
First we describe the results concerning the dependence of Z  T distribution on CSF
Figure 3 shows the distribution of stellar populations on the Z  T map for model with CSF
 035 and for 35 respectively The meaning of the T is that the stellar component with
smaller T is born earlier thus older The vertical hight in each bin of Z and T denotes
the number of star particles with Z and T In this gure we can observe that there is an
appreciable scatter in the metallicity for a xed T This scatter of metallicity for a given T
is one of the characteristics of chemical evolution of galaxies in which chemical components
produced by star formation are less eciently and less widely mixed into the whole region
of galaxies as has been already pointed out by Steinmetz  Muller 1994 for dissipatively
collapsing galaxies Z  T distribution in the model with CSF  35 is shifted toward
the larger Z and smaller T older in age than in the model with CSF  035 meaning
that a larger amount of metal-enriched stars are produced more rapidly in the merger with
rapid star formation than in that with gradual one Spread in T for a xed Z is more
likely to be larger in the model with CSF  035 than in that CSF  35 whereas Z  T
distribution is more strongly peaked in the model with CSF  35 than in that CSF  035
These results imply that in the model with CSF  035 star formation proceeds less rapidly
and more gradually resulting in a smaller amount of metal-enriched stellar populations and
a larger amount of younger stellar populations This tendency of stellar populations plays
an important role in determining the mean metallicity and age and thus the photometric
and spectroscopic evolution of merger remnants as is described later
Second we observe how the mean stellar metallicity depends on the rapidity of star
 24 
formation and explain the origin of the dependence As is shown in Figure 4 which
describes the time evolution of mean stellar metallicity  Z  of each merger remnant
the chemical enrichment proceeds faster and more eciently in the model with larger CSF
than the model with smaller CSF and thus the nal value of  Z  is larger in the model
with larger CSF than the model with smaller CSF The time when  Z  exceeds 0015
is T  07 for the model with CSF  35 and T  50 for the model with CSF  035
and the asymptotic value of  Z  the value at T  150 in our units is 00237 for
the model with CSF  35 and 00185 for the model with CSF  035 This result clearly
demonstrates that in dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation the rapidity of star
formation is an important factor even for determining the global and average chemical
properties of merger remnants The physical reason for this dependence can be explained as
follows For a galaxy merger with more rapid star formation less amount of interstellar gas
is tidally stripped away from the system during galaxy merging principally because more
amount of initial gas has been already converted to stellar component before the system
suers more severely from violently varying gravitational potential of galaxy merging As a
result of this more amount of the gas is consequently metal-enriched to a larger extent and
converted into stellar component during merging Thus more amount of metals is shared
by stellar component in the remnant of the galaxy merger with more rapid star formation
Moreover this observed tendency of the CSF dependence of mean stellar metallicity is
found to be applied to the ve standard models See the seventh column in the Table 1 for
Model B1  B5 These results provide a potential success of reproducing qualitatively
the mass-metallicity relation of elliptical galaxies If the value of the CSF is larger for more
luminous galaxy merger then the derived result indicates that galaxy mergers between more
luminous spirals are more likely to become ellipticals with larger stellar metallicity This
furthermore suggests that even the origin of fundamental photometric and spectroscopic
properties such as the color-magnitude relation in elliptical galaxies are closely associated
 25 
with the details of galactic dynamics

In order to observe more clearly the above strong dynamical coupling between
dynamical evolution and chemical one we perform a set of comparative simulations in
which chemical evolution including star formation is solved but the dynamical one
gravitational and dissipative dynamics is not for an isolated galactic disk Model A3
and A4 Accordingly the density distribution and kinematical properties in the disk are
xed during the simulations Since the time evolution of the gas mass fraction is the most
fundamental determinant for the mean stellar metallicity in galaxies by investigating the
eects of galactic dynamics on the time evolution of gas mass fraction and the nal gas mass
fraction we observe how the dynamical evolution can aect the chemical one in the present
merger model Figure 5 gives the time evolution of gas mass fraction fg for isolated disks
without dynamical evolution Model A3 and A4 and for mergers Model B1 and B5 As
is shown in the lower panel of this Figure 5 the gas mass fraction at T  150 is not so
dierent between models with dierent CSF for isolated disks without dynamical evolution
Model A3 and A4 whereas signicant dierence in the nal gas mass fraction can be seen
for mergers Model B1 and B5 This result clearly indicates that dynamical evolution itself
greatly strengthens the dierence of nal gas mass fraction between merger models with
dierent CSF Therefore the chemical evolution in galaxy mergers is demonstrated to be
greatly aected by the dynamical evolution of galaxy merging In the merger model Model
B1 and B5 as is described before the total amount of interstellar gas tidally stripped
away from the system is determined by the rapidity of star formation CSF accordingly
the nal gas mass fraction is strongly aected by the rapidity of star formation This sort
of importance of the rapidity of star formation CSF in controlling the nal gas mass
fraction can be seen even in the isolated disk models Model A1 and A2 and can be
 26 
explained as follows See the upper panel of the Figure 5 In the model with smaller CSF
non-axisymmetric structures such as spiral arms and bars developed in the star-forming
disk can redistribute the mass and angular momentum of the remaining gaseous component
more eciently and for a longer times principally because a larger amount of gas has not
been yet converted into stellar component Consequently a larger amount of the gas is
transported outwardly in the disk and thus the mean gas density there is greatly dropped
o As a result of this only a smaller fraction of the outwardly transported gas can be
further converted into stellar component and thus the mean stellar metallicity is smaller for
the model with smaller CSF This result clearly shows that the redistribution of mass and
angular momentum driven by specic non-axisymmetric structures plays an important role
in determining the nal gas mass fraction in isolated disks Thus although the dynamical
mechanisms operating to yield the dierence in the nal gas mass fraction between models
with dierent rapidity of star formation is signicantly dierent between isolated disks
Model A1 and A2 and mergers Model B1 and B5 however these results say essentially
the same thing Chemical evolution of galaxies can be greatly aected by mass and angular
momentum redistribution driven by global dynamical process such as the violent relaxation
of galaxy merging and mass-transfer triggered by non-axisymmetric gravitational potential
of galaxies This sort of strong coupling between dynamical evolution and chemical one is
rst demonstrated by the present work and Bekki  Shioya 1997c

Third we observe the dierence in chemical evolution of merging galaxies between
the Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical one Figure 6 describes the
metallicity distribution of stellar component for the model with CSF  035 and for 35 on
each of which the metallicity distribution predicted from the Simple model is superimposed
In estimating the distribution of stellar metallicity expected from the Simple model for
 27 
each model we use the time evolution of gas mass fraction obtained for each merger
model Model B1 and B5 and then calculate the metallicity distribution according to the
standard formulation on the relation between gas mass fraction and mean stellar metallicity
for the Simple model Since the Simple model assumes both instantaneous recycling and
instantaneous mixing the Simple model corresponds to the present chemodynamical model
with Rche equal to innity We also give the values of mean stellar and gaseous metallicity
expected from the Simple model in the ninth and tenth column of the Table 1 by adopting
the following formulation
 Z   ymet 1 
fg ln fg
1  fg  
Zgas  ymet ln fg
As is shown in Figure 6 the metallicity distribution of the model with larger CSF is
shifted to righter side than the model with smaller CSF which is consistent with the already
obtained trend that the mean stellar metallicity of merger remnants with larger CSF is larger
than that of the remnants with smaller CSF Furthermore it is found that irrespectively
of the values of CSF the metallicity distribution is shifted to the righter direction in the
chemodynamical model than in the Simple one and thus that the spread of the distribution
is larger in the chemodynamical model This larger spread results from the fact that in
the present chemodynamical model the chemical enrichment proceeds preferentially in
the gaseous region with higher density where a larger amount of chemically enriched gas
is converted into new and more metal-enriched stars The magnitude of the dierence of
the distribution is found to be more likely to be larger for models with smaller CSF This
result clearly explains the reason why the dierence in the mean stellar metallicity between
the models with dierent values of CSF for the present chemodynamical model is smaller
than expected from the Simple model See the sixth seventh ninth and tenth column
in the Table 1 Gaseous metallicity on the other hand is found to be smaller in the
 28 
chemodynamical model compared with that expected from the Simple model and not to
depend on the values of CSF These dierences in the metallicity distribution between the
Simple model and chemodynamical one results in the dierence between these model in the
photometric and spectroscopic properties of merger remnants as is described in detail later
Thus we demonstrate that dynamical evolution of galaxy merging greatly aects the
chemical evolution in galaxy mergers and consequently the chemical evolution in mergers
is signicantly dierent from that expected from the Simple one-zone model What is
particularly important in the present study is that the tidal stripping of interstellar gas
during galaxy merging play a vital role in determining even the global chemical properties
of merger remnants This tidal stripping of interstellar gas is probably more important in
galaxy mergers with a larger amount of interstellar gas for example in the mergers at
higher redshift or in the mergers between less luminous spirals

312 Radial gradient of stellar populations
Here we rst observe how successfully the observed prole of radial metallicity gradient
of elliptical galaxies can be reproduced in merger remnants and how the rapidity of star
formation controls the absolute magnitude of the gradient Observational studies have
revealed that the radial metallicity gradient of elliptical galaxies can be tted reasonably
well by the power-low prole and that the magnitude of the gradients  log Z log R are
-02 on average Peletier et al 1990 Davies et al 1991 Mihos  Hernquist 1994 found
 29 
that the collisionless galaxy mergers between spirals with exponential prole of metallicity
gradient become ellipticals with the metallicity gradient prole appreciably deviating from
power-low prole implying that the later mergers with less amount of gaseous dissipation
can not reproduce the observed gradient with power-low proles Figure 7 gives the radial
distribution of stellar and gaseous metallicity for the present merger model with star
formation and gaseous dissipation As is shown in this gure negative metallicity gradient
tted by power-low prole is reproduced reasonably well for model with CSF  035 and
35 which indicates that the origin of the metallicity gradients of elliptical galaxies are
closely associated with dissipative galaxy merging with star formation A merger remnant
in the model with CSF  035 has larger stellar metallicity in the central part and smaller
metallicity in the outer part than the remnant in the model with CSF  35 meaning
that the metallicity gradient is larger for the model with less rapid star formation The
qualitative explanation for this trend of metallicity gradients can be given as follows In
the model with smaller CSF a larger amount of metal enriched gas can be transferred to
the inner region of the remnant owing to less rapid star formation and more amount of
gaseous dissipation In the outer part of the merger with smaller CSF star formation is less
likely to proceed eciently and thus less likely to form metal-enriched stars because of the
lower gaseous density in the outer part As a result of this a relatively larger metallicity
gradient is established for the model with smaller CSF For the model with larger CSF on
the other hand a larger amount of gas has been converted into metal-enriched stars before
the onset of violent relaxation thus the stellar component in the galaxy merger suers more
severely from chemical mixing driven by violent relaxation owing to less amount of gaseous
dissipation As a result of this the metallicity gradient is more strongly washed out and
consequently the absolute magnitude of it becomes smaller for model with larger CSF The
obtained value of metallicity gradient is found to be smaller than that of the typical value
of observation -02 for most of models with Rche  04 This result indicates that in the
 30 
present chemodynamical model of galaxy mergers chemical mixing controlled basically
by the chemical mixing length and the degree of violent relaxation of galaxy merging is
appreciably more ecient than required for reproducing the observed trend
Next we observe the dependence of the radial gradient of stellar age on the rapidity
of star formation It has been generally considered that it is dicult to derive the age
gradient observationally since the color gradient is aected both by metallicity gradient
and by age gradient ie the age-metallicity degeneracy problem Recently Faber et al
1995 and Bressan et al 1996 have succeeded in breaking the degeneracy by using the
combination of line strength indices H and MgFe Faber et al 1995 furthermore found
that outer parts of elliptical galaxies are more likely to be both older and more metal-poor
than nuclei This observational trend is found to be reproduced more successfully in the
model with smaller CSF for the present merger model suggesting that such a trend of age
and metallicity gradient of elliptical galaxies is just one of the evidences that an elliptical
galaxy is formed by galaxy merging Figure 8 describes the radial gradient of mean epoch
of star formation  T  which corresponds to the age gradient in merger remnants As
is shown in Figure 8 the age gradient is more discernibly seen in the model with CSF 
035 than the model with CSF  35 primarily because in the model with CSF  035 the
star formation proceeds more gradual and more later in the inner region of the merger
remnant Since it is found that the stellar metallicity is larger for the central region than
for the outer region of a merger remnant this result means that in the model with CSF 
035 the inner part of the merger remnant show both younger age and a larger degree of
chemical enrichment whereas in the model with CSF  35 the inner part of the merger
remnant show both slightly older age and a slightly larger degree of chemical enrichment
Interestingly the result for the model with CSF  35 can be seen also in the result of
Bressan et al 1996 which describes that there are a number of elliptical galaxies whose
nucleus are both older and more metal-enriched Thus the rapidity of star formation is
 31 
demonstrated to determine both the proles and the magnitude of the metallicity and age
gradients in galaxy mergers Both the metallicity gradient and the age one in the model
with rapid star formation are shallower than that with less rapid star formation

313 The shape of isochromes
The shape of isochromes and the degree of the dierence between the isochromes and
isophotes shapes are considered to be observational clues about the origin of the formation
and evolution of elliptical galaxies As is revealed by the observation of multi-band
photometry eg Boroson et al 1983 the shapes of isochromes are appreciably similar
to those of isophotes in elliptical galaxies In the dissipative collapse model of Larson
1975 the shapes of isochromes are signicantly atter than those of isophotes which is
not in agreement with the above observation In the Carlberg 1984s dissipative collapse
model of elliptical galaxy formation the shapes of isochromes are slightly atter than the
isophotal shapes and thus appears to have succeeded in overcoming the disadvantage of
the Larsons collapse model regarding the dierence between isochromes and isophotes
shapes Here we observe whether or not the shape of isochromes can match reasonably
well with that of isophotes in the present dissipative merger model Although the color of
a galaxy is aected by both metallicity and age of stellar populations we assume that the
iso-metallicity contour is exactly the same as the isochromes one and that the iso-density
contour is also the same as the isophote one In Figure 9 we show arbitrary isochromes
solid line and isophotes dotted line for the model with CSF  35 We found that
the shapes of isochromes are nearly the same as those of isophotes and furthermore that
this trend is not dependent so strongly on the CSF These results suggest that violent
 32 
relaxation combined with an appreciable amount of gaseous dissipation which is a specic
dynamical process for dissipative galaxy mergers plays a vital role in producing the shape
of isochromes which can match well with the isophotal shape

32 Fundamental roles of other parameters
In addition to the rapidity of star formation chemical mixing length the orbit
conguration of galaxy merging the multiplicity of a merger and the epoch of galaxy
merging are considered to be fundamental factors for chemical photometric and
spectroscopic properties We accordingly observe how and to what extent the above four
parameters strengthen or lessen the CSF dependence of chemical properties derived in 31
Dependence of chemical properties on the four parameters is summarized in Figure 10 for
mean stellar metallicity Figure 11 for mean epoch of star formation Figure 12 for stellar
metallicity gradient Figure 13 for radial gradient of mean epoch of star formation What
should be emphasized in these gures is that although variety in the values of the above
four parameters indeed introduces appreciable scatter in the CSF dependence of chemical
 33 
properties derived in 31 however the basic trends in the CSF dependence derived in 31
is not so drastically changed For example the mean stellar metallicity of a merger remnant
is larger in the model with larger CSF for a give chemical mixing length orbit conguration
multiplicity and merging epoch Accordingly in the following parts 321  324 we
mainly present outstanding results which we could not obtain only by varying the value
of CSF in the previous subsection 31 and furthermore we describe the fundamental roles
specic for the above four parameters in determining the chemical properties of merger
remnants
321 Mixing length of chemical component
It is considered to be highly uncertain how locally and how well metals ejected from
stars with dierent masses and ages can be actually mixed into interstellar medium in
galaxies eg Roy  Kunth 1995 Because of this uncertainty it is the best way in the
preliminary stage of the present study to vary the values of the chemical mixing length
represented by Rche in each model and thereby to examine its importance in determining
chemical properties of galaxies We found that irrespective of the values of CSF as the
values of Rche becomes smaller the mean stellar metallicity becomes larger See the seventh
column in the Table 1 for Model B6 7 8 and 9 This result can be explained as follows
In the model with smaller Rche metals produced by star formation in higher density region
can be mixed into the surrounding interstellar gas more locally and accordingly the metals
are more likely to be trapped only by the gas in the higher density region Consequently
chemical enrichment proceeds more preferentially in the higher density regions where a
larger number of stars are formed and thus the mean stellar metallicity in the merger is
basically determined As a result of this a larger number of stars are more likely to be
born from the gas with a larger metallicity and thus the mean stellar metallicity of merger
 34 
remnants is larger for galaxy mergers with smaller Rche This result indicates that if the
Rche is larger for the model with smaller CSF the already obtained CSF dependence of mean
stellar metallicity is strengthened See Figure 10 We also found that for most models
as the values of Rche is smaller the negative metallicity gradient becomes steeper See
Figure 12 This result reects the fact that the chemical enrichment can proceed more
preferentially in the higher density ie inner region such as the nuclei of mergers in the
model with smaller Rche
What is the most interesting result derived by varying the Rche is that for the model
with smaller Rche and CSF the mean gaseous metallicity is smaller than the stellar one in
the merger remnant See the sixth and seventh column in the Table1 for Model B6 and
B8 This result can not be obtained until both dynamical and chemical evolution are
solved in a admittedly self-consistent manner since the Simple one-zone model predicts
that the gaseous metallicity is never smaller than the stellar one Furthermore this result
provide a valuable clue about the origin of metal-poor hot gaseous halo of elliptical galaxies
The X-ray satellite ASCA Advanced Satellite f or Cosmology and Astrophysics the
metallicity of the hot X-ray gaseous halo is appreciably smaller than that of the stellar
component of the host elliptical galaxy eg Matsumoto et al 1997 The details of the
formation of metal-poor gaseous halo will be discussed in our future papers
322 Orbit conguration
Orbit parameters of galaxy merging such as the initial intrinsic spin of progenitor
disks and pericenter distance of mergers can aect the degree of violent relaxation and
the redistribution of mass and angular momentum during merging thus determine the
transfer process of chemical component in mergers We accordingly investigate how the
initial inclinations of two progenitor disks Model C D and E and pericenter distance
 35 
Model F can aect the nal chemical properties of merger remnants We found that
for the model with larger CSF in each model sequence Model C D E and F the mean
stellar metallicity of merger remnants is larger whereas the mean epoch of star formation
 T  is smaller See Figures 10 and 11 which is consistent with the results derived in
32 and thus reinforces the importance of the rapidity of star formation in determining the
mean stellar metallicity and mean stellar age in merger remnants As is shown in Figure
12 both the magnitude of negative metallicity gradient and that of age gradient in merger
models are distributed with appreciable spread even for a xed value of CSF 035 and
35 suggesting that the spread in the magnitude of metallicity and age gradient observed
in elliptical galaxies with a given luminosity is due to the diversity in orbit conguration of
galaxy merging The origin of the relatively larger negative value of metallicity gradient
observed for model with nearly prograde-prograde merger Model D2 is probably that
the developed prolate stellar bar in the SB0-like merger remnant more eciently transfers
the chemical component into the central region and consequently enhances the dierence
in stellar metallicity between outer and inner region in the galaxy This result should be
compered with the result of Friedli  Benz 1995 in which the rotating stellar bar changes
the mass and angular momentum distribution of stars and gas in a galactic disk and
consequently smoothes out the already existing metallicity gradient of the barred galaxy
The dierence in the dynamical roles of stellar bars between the present study and that of
Friedli  Benz 1995 probably results from the dierences in the total amount of gas mass
and the strength of dynamical perturbation assumed in the two studies More detailed
studies are required for understanding more clearly the dynamical roles of triaxiality ie
barred structure in determining the chemical gradient of galaxies and their dependences
on galaxy types
 36 
323 Multiple galaxy merging
Multiple mergers between late-type spirals are suggested to play important roles for
example in forming eld elliptical galaxies Barnes 1989 and in mitigating the diculty
of pair mergers to produce the observed smaller degree of kinematical misalignment Weil
 Hernquist 1996 We here present the dierence in a number of chemical properties
of merger remnants between pair mergers and multiple ones Model G1 and G2 The
dierences obtained in the present study are the following four First irrespectively of CSF
a larger amount of interstellar gas is stripped away and consequently can not participate
further star formation in multiple mergers than in pair mergers This is rstly because
the tidal stripping of interstellar gas is more ecient in multiple mergers owing to the
more violent dynamical interaction between galaxy mergers and secondly because a smaller
amount of mass can be transferred to the inner region and thus can not form the higher
density gaseous regions in multiple mergers Second as a result of this a larger amount
of metal-poor gas nally surrounds the merger remnant in multiple mergers which might
be observed as the metal-poor gaseous X-ray halo as is actually observed in elliptical
galaxies eg Matsumoto et al 1997 Third the CSF dependence of chemical properties
in pair merger remnants in particular the CSF dependence of metallicity gradient are less
discernable in multiple mergers This is probably because chemical mixing driven by violent
gravitational relaxation of galaxy merging is more eective in multiple mergers Fourth
in the multiple merger model with CSF  35 the stellar populations in the central part
of the merger remnant is both older and less metal-enriched than the outer part which
is a specic characteristic of chemical properties for multiple mergers with larger CSF in
the present study This result is reected in the fact that in the multiple merger model
with CSF  35 the magnitude of metallicity gradient for the region 05Re  R  50Re
Re is eective radius is -007 whereas it is 019 for the region 01Re  R  10Re
Actually Bressan et al 1996 show that there are a number of galaxies possessing the
 37 
same trend as is described above Since only a relatively smaller range of parameter space
has been investigated in the present study we could not here give a stronger statement
that the elliptical galaxies with older and less metal-enriched stellar populations in the
central part of the galaxies are indicative of multiple mergers Accordingly it would be
our further study to conrm the above result by performing numerical simulations with a
larger range of parameter space for multiple mergers and furthermore to investigate what is
the fundamental chemical properties specic for multiple mergers Thus these four results
demonstrate that the multiplicity in galaxy mergers can also aect a number of chemical
properties in merger remnants thus in elliptical galaxies

324 Epoch of galaxy merging
We here investigate how the dierence in the epoch of galaxy merging can aect the
fundamental chemical properties of merger remnants by varying the initial separation
between two progenitor disk rin and thereby delaying the epoch of galaxy merging
Model B10  15 We found that a galaxy merger with larger rin later merger becomes
an elliptical galaxy with both more metal-enriched and younger stellar populations and
furthermore that this tendency does not depend on the values of CSF See the Figure 14
These results can be explained as follows In the later galaxy merger the model with larger
rin a larger amount of interstellar gas can continue to be converted into stellar component
and chemically enriched in the progenitor disk for a longer time since the merging epoch
 38 
is delayed Consequently new stars younger stellar populations are more preferentially
born from more chemically enriched interstellar gas when the later starburst is triggered by
the later galaxy merging As a result of this stellar populations in the later galaxy merger
are both younger and more metal-enriched on average than the earlier merger Faber et
al 1995 and Worthey et al 1996 suggest that if the younger galaxies are actually
more metal-rich than older ones the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be
equally reproduced without invoking the conventionally believed mass-metallicity relation
of elliptical galaxies They furthermore suggest that even if there exists outstanding spread
in the luminosity-weighted age and metallicity among elliptical galaxies the tightness of
the color-magnitude relation can be maintained with a specic assumption that the age
and metallicity Z satises the relation  log age log Z  -15 Wortheys law It is
remarkable that the above numerical result that a merger remnant with younger stellar
populations is more metal-enriched is at least qualitatively consistent with the Wortheys
law Although more extensive observational studies should be accumulated which can
conrm whether or not the Wortheys law is universal among elliptical galaxies with
dierent luminosity and with dierent environment we can say however that the nature
of stellar populations of elliptical galaxies is closely associated with the epoch of galaxy
merging and thus with the strength of the secondary burst of star formation during galaxy
merging Specically it is crucial for chemical and photometric properties of elliptical
galaxies formed by galaxy merging how much amount of interstellar gas the progenitor
disks still have and to what degree the gas has been already metal-enriched just before
galaxy merging Although our numerical study appears to have succeeded in grasping
some essential ingredients concerning the dependence of the chemical properties of merger
remnants on the epoch of galaxy merging a larger range of parameter space should be
covered by our future studies in order to conrm the derived dependence
Finally in this subsection 32 we give the dependence of age gradient on metallicity
 39 
one for all merger models in Figure 15 As is shown in this Figure 15 the merger model
with larger magnitude of metallicity gradient show the larger magnitude of age gradient
which is actually observed in Bressan et al 1996

We have so far focused mainly on the parameter dependence of chemical properties
of merger remnants and did not intend to describe the photometric and spectroscopic
properties of the remnants by adopting a specic mass and size for each merger model in
the previous subsections 31 and 32 We here describe photometric and spectroscopic
properties of merger remnants by assuming that the model with CSF  10 corresponds
to the galaxy merger between late-type spirals with mass and size equal to the ducial
values of the present study Md  60  1010 M and Rd  175 kpc respectively and
that CSF  L055 This assumed relation is plausible see the Appendix A The assumed
relation CSF  L055 means that more luminous elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy
merging with more rapid star formation For convenient we consider that for each model
13 Gyr have passed since the two progenitor galaxies began to merge with a given rin This
means that we do not intend to include any initial age dierence between galaxy mergers
in this consideration thus means that the derived photometric and spectroscopic properties
basically reect the mean stellar metallicity of the remnants It should be emphasized
here that whether or not the above assumptions on the scaled mass and size of galaxy
 40 
mergers are actually reasonable and realistic is probably highly uncertain in the present
study because of the lack of extensive observational studies on the luminosity dependence
of star formation histories of disk galaxies and mergers Accordingly the derived luminosity
dependence of photometric and spectroscopic properties of merger remnants only reect the
adopted assumptions and thus we describe them only in a schematic manner Although this
investigation could not allow us to compare the photometric properties of merger remnants
with the observational ones of real elliptical galaxies in a more quantitive way however
it enable us to point out in a quantitative way the possible advantages and disadvantages
of the present merger model in reproducing the observed photometric properties of real
elliptical galaxies In the following parts 331 and 332 luminosity dependence of mean
stellar metallicity metallicity gradient and integrated color of merger remnants are mainly
presented
331 Chemical properties
Based upon the results presented in the Figures 10 11 12 and 13 we can obtain the
following dependence More luminous elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging show
1 larger mean stellar metallicity 2 smaller central stellar metallicity and 3 smaller
radial gradient of stellar metallicity The rst result appears to agree qualitatively with
the mass-metallicity relation implied by the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies
Faber 1973 Visvanathan  Sandage 1977 whereas the second result appears to disagree
with the expected luminosity dependence of the central metallicity of elliptical galaxies
indicated by the Mg2 -  relation Burstein et al 1988 It still seems less feasible to
determine whether the third result matches with the observed luminosity dependence of
stellar metallicity gradient in elliptical galaxies as is described below Although a number
of observational studies have been accumulated which describe the dependence of the
 41 
metallicity gradient on galactic parameters however the clear trend in the dependence
seems less likely as is described below Carollo et al 1992 reported that Mg2 index
gradient shows a bimodal trend with mass For less massive galaxies M  1011M the
Mg2 gradient increase with increasing mass whereas for massive galaxies M  1011M
there is no obvious pattern in mass dependence of the gradient Gonzalez  Gorgas 1996
found the gradient of Mg2 index correlates with the central Mg2 index Galaxies with
steeper gradient of Mg2 index have larger central Mg2 index Since central Mg2 index
becomes larger as the mass of galaxy increases this correlation suggests that massive
galaxies are more likely to have steeper metallicity gradient Furthermore Peletier et al
1990 reported that there is no correlation between color gradient which is a combination
of age and metallicity gradients and the luminosity of galaxies Thus it is safe for us to say
that we could not here give any implications on the origin for the dependence of metallicity
gradient on the galactic parameters We must wait further extensive studies which reveal
clear trends in the dependence of metallicity gradient on the galactic parameters in order
to compare the derived CSF dependence of metallicity gradient in the present study with
the observational results
332 Photometric and spectroscopic properties
Figure 16 is the radial distribution of U  R and B  R color in the merger remnant for
the ducial model with CSF  10 The observed color gradient in this model is principally
due to the metallicity gradient of the merger remnant since the age dierence between outer
part and inner one in the merger remnant is less than 1 Gyr We found that this relatively
shallower color gradient is more discernibly seen in more luminous merger remnants
mergers with rapid star formation Figure 17 describes the color-magnitude CM relation
derived for 25 models In order to observe the dierence in the photometric properties
 42 
mean color between the Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical one we
calculate the photometric properties expected from the Simple model for the ve standard
models Model B1  5 by using the star formation history obtained for the ve models
The derived results of the Simple one-zone model are plotted in the same gure for ve
models As is shown in Figure 17 more luminous merger remnant corresponding to the
galaxy merger with larger CSF show the redder color in the V  K however the derived
luminosity dependence of the integrated color does not agree reasonably well with the
observed color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies What this result actually means
depends on whether or not we adopt the conventional point of view regarding the origin of
the observed CM relation of elliptical galaxies In the conventional points of view Faber
1973 Visvanathan  Sandage 1977 the CM relation reects the mass-metallicity relation
of galaxies metallicity eect  whereas in the newly proposed view Faber et al 1995
Worthey et al 1996 the CM relation reects the fact that less luminous elliptical galaxies
are progressively younger than more luminous ones age eect If we adopt the former
conventional point of view we should conclude as follows The above result means that the
observed color-magnitude relation mass-metallicity relation could not be reproduced so
successfully by the present merger model with CSF  L055 As has been already pointed
out by Bekki  Shioya 1997c even the present merger model in which any age dierence
between galaxies and any thermal and dynamical feedback eects of star formation are
not included can reproduce at least qualitatively the observed CM relation if we assume
that CSF  L169 However this assumption CSF  L169 seems less plausible since for
deriving the CSF  L169 we must adopt somewhat particular assumptions for example
that the initial density of the progenitor disk  in a merger depends strongly on the
galactic luminosity L in such a way that   L456 Therefore instead of adopting such
apparently less realistic assumptions we should reconsider other fundamental parameters
that are important determinant for chemical evolution of galaxy mergers and strongly
 43 
depend on the galactic mass and then again investigate the luminosity dependent chemical
and photometric properties of merger remnants On the other hand if we adopt the
latter fresh point of view Faber et al 1995 Worthey et al 1996 we should conclude
as follows The derived result on the CM relation does not necessarily disagree with the
observed CM relation of elliptical galaxies In this case we must wait further extensive
observational studies which reveal to what extent each age eect and metallicity eect
actually contributes to the generation of the CM relation and clarify the relative importance
of the two eects in the reproduction of the CM relation It would be our future studies
to elucidate the origin of the relative importance in the context of dissipative galaxy
merging when the relative contribution of the two age eect and metallicity eect are
observationally claried Considering these situations it is safe for us to say that we can not
determine how successfully the present merger model has reproduced the CM relation until
more extensive observational studies clarify the relative importance of the two metallicity
eect and age eect
Lastly we give a comment on the dierence in the photometric and spectroscopic
properties between the Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical one
As is shown in Figure 17 the V  K color is bluer in the Simple model than in the
chemodynamical one which results from the fact that the stellar metallicity in the Simple
model is smaller compared with that of the chemodynamical one This result implies that
the chemical photometric and spectroscopic properties derived by adopting the Simple
one-zone model is not better approximation as is tacitly understood especially when the
more quantitative comparison of the theoretical results with observational ones are required
4 Discussion

41 Outstanding dierence between the Simple one-zone model and the
present chemodynamical one
We here present the two outstanding dierences in chemical evolution between the
Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical one and then give the related
implications on the chemical evolution of elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy mergers
First we stress that even if we discuss the global and mean properties of chemical and
photometric evolution of elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy mergers both chemical and
dynamical evolution should be solved in an admittedly self-consistent way As is described
in detail in the previous sections chemical enrichment process during dissipative galaxy
merging with star formation which is controlled basically by the violent relaxation of galaxy
merging and gaseous dissipation is found to proceed in a considerably inhomogeneous
way This nature of chemical enrichment process provides a remarkably dierence between
the Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical one in that the nal gas
mass fraction is not only the important determinant for the nal stellar metallicity in
the present chemodynamical model As a natural result of this dierence photometric
and spectroscopic properties such as the integrated color in V  K is observed to be
appreciably dierent between the Simple one-zone model and the present chemodynamical
one Although the dierence in the photometric and spectroscopic properties of merger
remnants between the two models is not so large however we should recognize how the
details of dynamical evolution of forming elliptical galaxies modify the results derived by
the Simple one-zone model especially when comparing the theoretical results more precisely
with the observational ones Furthermore in the present chemodynamical model chemical
enrichment is found to proceed faster in the higher density region ie inner region where
star formation occurs more eciently than in the lower density one ie outer region
which strengthens the dierence in the degree of chemical enrichment between the higher
density inner region and the lower outer one chemical segregation This sort of
 45 
chemical segregation could give a natural explanation for the origin of the dierence in
the photometric and spectroscopic properties between the outer and the central part in an
elliptical galaxy
Second we should emphasize the fundamental roles of chemical mixing length in
determining a number of chemical properties in merger remnants such as the mean stellar
metallicity and radial metallicity gradient Unlike the Simple one-zone model chemical
enrichment is assumed to proceed locally in the present merger model As is described in
detail in the previous sections both radial metallicity gradient and mean stellar metallicity
in merger remnants depend on how locally metals ejected from stellar component can be
mixed into interstellar gas Both mean stellar metallicity and the absolute magnitude of
radial gradient of stellar metallicity are larger for the merger remnant with smaller mixing
length of chemical component Moreover the chemical mixing length is found to determine
how much amount of heavy elements ejected from stellar component can be shared by
stars or interstellar gas accordingly to aect the formation of gaseous halo which is less
metal-enriched than stellar component of merger remnants These results suggest that the
rapidity of star formation in mergers is not only the dominant factor which determines
the chemical properties of merger remnants thus that we should investigate the physical
relation between the rapidity of star formation and chemical mixing length in galaxies
and its dependence on galactic luminosity for more clear understanding of the chemical
photometric and spectroscopic evolution of galaxy mergers There still remains a wide
room for investigating and understanding the chemical evolution of galaxy mergers
42 On the origin of color-magnitude relation
The color-magnitude CM relation of elliptical galaxies is considered to be one of the
most fundamental relations containing valuable information about formation history of
 46 
elliptical galaxies The CM relation describes that the integrated color of elliptical galaxies
becomes redder as the absolute magnitude of the luminosity decrease eg Faber 1973
Although the age dierence between elliptical galaxies has been recently demonstrated
to play an important role in the reproduction of the CM relation eg Worthey et al
1996 it has been conventionally considered that the mean stellar metallicity is larger for
more luminous elliptical galaxies eg Tinsley 1978 Larson 1974 originally proposed
that this luminosity-dependent mean stellar metallicity observed in elliptical galaxies is
essentially ascribed to when star formation is entirely truncated owing to the so-called
galactic wind driven by accumulated thermal energy produced mainly by supernovae
in the early stage of dissipative collapse Although there is a large number of studies to
adopt this galactic wind model and to investigate the origin of the CM relation by using
evolutionary method of population synthesis eg Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 more recently
Bressan et al 1994 however only a few studies have addressed the fundamental question
about wether or not the merger model of elliptical galaxy formation can also reproduce
the mass-metallicity relation Thus we begin to discuss this important issue in terms of
elliptical galaxy formation by galaxy merging provided that the color-magnitude relation
reects the mass-metallicity relation in elliptical galaxies
As is described in the previous section what is remarkable in the present merger
model is that even if we do not include the thermal and dynamical feedback eects of
type II supernovae on the gas dynamics in merging galaxies nal gas mass fraction and
mean stellar metallicity in merger remnants depend on the star formation history and thus
on galactic luminosity owing to the tidal truncation of star formation This mechanism
that the mass-metallicity relation can be closely associated with the details of dynamics of
galaxy merging is quite dierent from that invoked by the classical galactic wind model
This result furthermore implies that there can be a number of ways to reproduce the
mass-metallicity relation in elliptical galaxies and thus the CM relation probably has more
 47 
profound meanings than we can deduce by invoking only a specic model of elliptical
galaxy formation Here we should note that although our merger model have a potential
success in reproducing at least qualitatively the mass-metallicity relation more totally and
successful comparison of our merger model with the mass-metallicity relation required for
the reproduction of the CM relation is found to be less promising without appealing the
less realistic assumption that CSF  L169 Bekki  Shioya 1997c This result implies
either that other physical processes such as the thermal and dynamical eects of type
II supernovae on the galactic dynamics should be further incorporated into the present
merger model or that the observed CM relation should not be interpreted so simply in
terms of mass-metallicity relation Thus it is one of our further study to investigate to what
degree the dynamical and thermal eects of supernovae-driven energy associated with the
burst of star formation during galaxy merging can modify the present results We should
also reexamine the validity of the assumption that the observed CM relation is actually
mass-metallicity relation of elliptical galaxy as is described below
A growing number of observational and theoretical studies aiming at breaking the
age-metallicity degeneracy suggest that the CM relation of elliptical galaxies does not
necessary mean the mass-metallicity relation Faber et al 1995 suggest that even if the
mean stellar metallicity between elliptical galaxies are the same with each other the CM
relation can be equally reproduced with the assumption that the eective age of stellar
populations is progressively younger for less luminous ellipticals age eect Furthermore
Worthey et al 1996 demonstrate that even if the typical or luminosity-weighted age of
galaxy is considerably spread more than several Gyr between elliptical galaxies for a given
luminosity the tightness of the color-magnitude relation can be maintained with a specic
relation that younger elliptical galaxies should be more metal-enriched the Wortheys
32 law This result implies that single burst model of elliptical galaxy formation such
as the galactic wind one in which star formation is assumed to be truncated at most
 48 
within 2 Gyr can not be accepted at all for a realistic model of elliptical galaxy formation
Kodama  Arimoto 1996 construct a specic model designed to mimic the age eect
in order to check the validity of the above suggestion and demonstrate that the pure
age eect is not convincing for reproducing both the tightness of the color-magnitude
relation observed in the present cluster ellipticals and that in the intermediate redshift
cluster ellipticals It is safe to say here that neither the pure age eect nor the pure
metallicity eect ie mass-metallicity relation could explain a growing number of
evidences suggesting the diversity of star formation history in elliptical galaxies We must
wait more extensive observational studies which can conrm whether the suspected age
spread and the Wortheys 32 law both of which shed new insight on the origin of the
CM relation are robust and does not depend on the galactic mass environment and
redshift We can say however that both the age spread and the Wortheys 32 law could
be naturally explained by the present merger model in a rather qualitative manner As is
demonstrated in the previous sections the epoch of galaxy merging can aect both the
mean age and metallicity of merger remnants in the sence that later mergers are more
likely to become ellipticals with more metal-enriched and younger stellar populations This
result suggests that the Wortheys 32 law can be essentially ascribed to the dierence in
the epoch of galaxy merging between galaxy mergers Furthermore as is predicted by the
semi-analytical models of galaxy formation based upon the hierarchical clustering scenario
with CDM cosmogony eg Baugh et al 1996 it is quite reasonable that the epoch of
galaxy merging diers from galaxies to galaxies Accordingly the luminosity weighted ages
which might be dependent on the strength of the secondary starbursts in galaxy merging
can be naturally spread between elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging Thus galaxy
merging between late-type spirals which might be occurred in variedly dierent epoch is
a promising candidate that can explain the apparent diversity of star formation history
observed in real elliptical galaxy and nevertheless can explain the tightness of the CM
relation of elliptical galaxies

5 Conclusion
Main results obtained in the present study are summarized as follows
1 Galaxy mergers with more rapid star formation become ellipticals with larger mean
stellar metallicity primarily because in the mergers with more rapid gas consumption
a smaller amount of metal-enriched gas is tidally stripped away during merging and
consequently a larger amount of the gas can be converted into stellar component This
result is demonstrated not to depend so strongly on the other parameters such as the orbit
conguration of galaxy merging and multiplicity of the mergers These results suggest that
the origin of the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be closely associated
with the details of merging dynamics which depends on the rapidity of star formation thus
on the galactic luminosity in galaxy mergers
2 Negative metallicity gradient tted reasonably well by power-low can be reproduced
by dissipative galaxy mergers with star formation which is in good agreement with the
recent observational results of elliptical galaxies The absolute magnitude of metallicity
gradient in each merger remnant depends on the orbit conguration of each galaxy merging
suggesting that the observed dispersion in the absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient for
a given luminosity range of elliptical galaxies reects the diversity in the orbit conguration
of galaxy merging
3 Absolute magnitude of metallicity gradient correlates with that of age gradient in
a merger in the sence that a merger remnant with steeper negative metallicity gradient
is more likely to show steeper age gradient This result reects the fact that the degree
of violent relaxation and gaseous dissipation during merging strongly aect both the age
 50 
gradient and metallicity one
4 The outer part of stellar populations is both older and less metal-enriched than
nuclei in an elliptical galaxy formed by galaxy merging with less rapid star formation
Moreover galaxy mergers with less rapid star formation are more likely to become ellipticals
with metal-poor gaseous halo This result suggests that the formation of metal-poor X-ray
halo actually observed in elliptical galaxies can be essentially ascribed to the dissipative
galaxy merging between late-type spirals and furthermore provides a clue to a solution for
the iron abundance discrepancy problem in elliptical galaxies
5 The epoch of galaxy merging aects both the mean stellar metallicity and the
mean stellar age in merger remnants Later galaxy mergers become ellipticals with both
younger and more metal-enriched stellar populations This result suggests that the origin
of Wortheys 32 rule Worthey et al 1996 which is invoked in maintaining the tightness
of the color-magnitude relation of elliptical galaxies can be understood in terms of the
dierence in the epoch of galaxy formation and transformation that is the epoch of galaxy
merging between elliptical galaxies
6 Luminosity dependence of chemical photometric and spectroscopic properties in
merger remnants which is derived by adopting a specic assumption on the luminosity
dependence of the rapidity of star formation of galaxy mergers does not match so
reasonable well with that observed in real elliptical galaxies This result implies that
other fundamental physical processes expected to be dependent on the galactic luminosity
should be incorporated into the present merger model for more successful comparison with
observational trends of luminosity-dependent chemical photometric and spectroscopic
properties of elliptical galaxies
7 As is described in the above 1 - 6 the details of gas dynamics of galaxy merging
in particular the tidal stripping of metal-enriched interstellar gas and the degree of gaseous
 51 
dissipation during merging both of which depend on the star formation history of galaxy
mergers are demonstrated to determine even the chemical and photometric properties of
merger remnants These results can not be obtained until both the chemical and dynamical
evolution during galaxy merging are solved numerically in a reasonably self-consistent way

A The expected luminosity dependence of the parameter CSF
A1 The importance of CSF
In the present study we adopt the assumption that more massive luminous elliptical
galaxies are formed by galaxy major merging between more massive luminous late-type
spirals and thereby investigate how the dierence of galactic mass luminosity of progenitor
disks in a merger can aect the chemical and photometric properties of merger remnants It
is reasonable and realistic that if the mass of merger progenitor is dierent between galaxy
mergers there could be remarkable dierences between mergers in the fundamental physical
processes related to the chemical evolution of galaxies such as the duration strength
time-scale of star formation star formation history dissipative dynamics of interstellar
gas thermal and dynamical eects of accumulated thermal energy driven supernovae
events and the chemical mixing driven by the dynamics of galaxy merging Accordingly
we should investigate such physical processes expected to be dependent on galactic mass
luminosity and thereby clarify the relative importance of these processes Among these
what has been the most extensively examined in the previous studies is the thermal and
dynamical feedback eects associated with the supernovae events primarily because the
ratio of the accumulated thermal energy driven by the supernovae to the total potential
energy of galaxies has been considered to depend predominantly on galactic luminosity
Although there are a number of important issues which should be addressed extensively
we here focus on the dierence in the star formation history between galaxy mergers with
dierent mass or luminosity and thus other important issues will be explored in our
future papers
The adopted working hypothesis that galactic mass predominantly determines the
star formation history of elliptical galaxies is quite realistic and reasonable since a growing
number of observational studies support this hypothesis For example the line ratio of
 53 
MgFe which can be interpreted as the strength of the past activity of type-II supernovae
relative to that of the type I supernovae implies that more luminous elliptical galaxies are
more likely to truncate their star formation earlier eg Worthey et al 1992 Furthermore
as is suggested by the analysis of H line index the epoch the strength and the duration
of the latest star formation of elliptical galaxies seem quite diverse implying that the
classical single burst picture of elliptical galaxy formation becomes less attractive Faber
et al 1995 It should be also emphasized that the B  H color in more luminous disk
galaxies which are considered to be merger precursors of more luminous ellipticals in the
present study is found to be redder than the less luminous one Wyse 1982 Bothun et al
1985 Gavazzi  Scodeggio 1996 These lines of observational evidences strongly motivate
us to clarify the important roles of star formation history in determining the chemical and
photometric properties as well as dynamical and kinematical ones in elliptical galaxies
In the present paper we focus particularly on the time-scale of gas consumption
by star formation relative to the dynamical time  scale of galaxy mergers It should
be emphasized here that the time-scale of gas consumption by star formation is not
considered to be an important determinant but the time-scale of gas consumption by star
formation relative to the dynamical time-scale is to be an important determinant The
reason for this consideration is explained as follows The time-scale of gas consumption
by star formation is the typical time-scale within which heavy elements are produced
by star formation and mixed into interstellar medium The dynamical time-scale is the
typical time-scale within which violent relaxation during galaxy merging cause the mass
and angular momentum redistribution and thus the dynamical mixing of heavy elements
produced by star formation Therefore if the dynamical time-scale is much larger than the
gas consumption time-scale star formation can proceed quite eciently before the system
reach the dynamical equilibrium and consequently the larger amount of heavy elements
produced by the star formation can suer more eective dynamical mixing of the heavy
 54 
elements during galaxy merging Thus since the dynamics of galaxy merging can strongly
aect even the chemical evolution in the present merger model the ratio of the above two
time-scales are expected to be more essential for the chemodynamical evolution of galaxy
mergers For convenient the inverse ratio of the time-scale of gas consumption by star
formation to the dynamical time-scale is referred to as the rapidity of star formation and
represented by the parameter CSF It is the CSF that we consider to depend strongly on the
galactic luminosity accordingly we investigate the most extensively the important roles of
CSF in determining fundamental characteristics of elliptical galaxies in the present study
A2 A possible luminosity dependence of CSF
The expected luminosity mass dependence of CSF is described as follows The
parameter CSF is set to be proportional to TdynTSF where Tdyn and TSF are the dynamical
time-scale and the time-scale of gas consumption by star formation respectively We here
dene the mass of a galactic disk the total mass of luminous and dark matter and size of
the progenitor as Md Mt and Rd respectively We consider here that gas mass in a disk is
equal to Md for simplicity The Tdyn is given as
Tdyn  R32
d M 12
Provided that the coecient in the Schmidt law is not dependent on the galactic mass or
luminosity we can derive TSF as follows
TSF  1 
where  is the surface density of the gas disk The parameter  is the exponent of Schmidt
law which is the same as that used in previous subsections Assuming the Freemans law
and the constant ratio of Rd to the scale length of exponential disk we derive
  MdR2
d  const
 55 
Assuming that the degree of self-gravity of a galactic disk is described as
then we can derive
Mt  M 1
CSF  M 142
Since  is considered to have positive value   06 Saglia 1996 this relationship predicts
that CSF becomes larger as Md increases Furthermore if we assume the constant mass to
light ratio for luminous matter we can obtain the luminosity dependence of CSF In this
case the dependence is described as CSF  L055
 where L055
is disk luminosity for   06
Alternatively if we adopt the observed trend that more luminous disks have large surface
density such as   Md McGaugh  Blok 1997 we can obtain CSF  M 122
 Thus
these simple theoretical arguments suggest that larger or more luminous disk galaxies are
more likely to have larger values of CSF

B Structure and morphology of merger remnants
Although our main purpose of the present paper is not concerned with the dynamical
properties of elliptical galaxies we briey describe how successfully the present merger
 56 
model can reproduce the luminosity-dependent dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies
The reason for this is that since in the present merger model the details of chemical
evolution are strongly aected by the dynamical evolution of galaxy mergers observing the
dynamical evolution of dissipative galaxy merging with star formation would help us to
understand more clearly the present results on chemical evolution of galaxy mergers
B1 Dependence on CSF
First we present morphological structural and kinematical properties of merger
remnants and their dependence on CSF As is described in details by Bekki  Shioya 1997a
b the galaxy mergers with larger CSF are found to be more likely to become elliptical
galaxies with less strongly supported by global rotation less strongly self-gravitating
smaller central surface brightness larger cores and boxy isophotal shape Figure 18
describes the morphological evolution of the model with CSF  035 Model B1 As the
dynamical interaction between star-forming disk galaxies becomes stronger an appreciably
amount of metal enriched gas is tidally stripped away from the disks and nally surrounds
the developed elliptical galaxy without further star formation and chemical enrichment
The developed metal-poor gaseous halo might be observed as the hot and metal-poor X-ray
halo of elliptical galaxies which has been recently revealed by the ASCA eg Matsumoto
et al 1997 The nal morphology of merger remnants depends strongly on the rapidity
of star formation represented by the CSF as is shown in Figure 19 A galaxy merger with
less rapid star formation becomes a more compact elliptical galaxy The density proles
of merger remnants are well tted by R14 law however the systematical deviation from
the R14 law is also observed depending on values of CSF as is shown in Figure 20 Unlike
the late galaxy merger in which the gas mass fraction of the precursor disk is less than
02 the present merger model with highly dissipative nature of interstellar gas succeeds
 57 
in boosting up more signicantly the central density of merger remnant compared with
isolated disk models Model A1 and A2 This result suggests the problems related to
phase space density of elliptical galaxies Ostriker 1980 Carlberg 1986 can be successfully
resolved in high-redshift galaxy mergers as has been already indicated by Kormendy 
Sanders 1992 These results imply that galaxy mergers with star formation and gaseous
dissipation which might be occurred the most frequently at higher redshift can naturally
explain the fundamental dynamical and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies For
further details see Bekki  Shioya 1997a b
B2 Dependence on galactic luminosity
By adopting a specic assumption on the luminosity dependence of the parameter CSF
we can observe how successfully the present merger can reproduce the luminositydependent
morphological structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies Although
describing the dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies and their dependence on galactic
luminosity is not main purpose of this paper however we beforehand and briey discuss
them since we will point out advantages and disadvantages of the present merger model in
reproducing both dynamical properties and chemical ones of elliptical galaxies in the section
4 Observational results indicate that more luminous elliptical galaxies are more likely to
be less rotationally supported Davies et al 1983 possess less luminous surface densify
Djorgovski et al 1996 and smaller phase space density Carlberg 1986 have boxy isophote
Kormendy  Bender 1996 and larger cores Kormendy  Djorgovski 1989 If we assume
that CSF  L055 that is more luminous elliptical galaxies are formed by galaxy mergers
with more rapid star formation our numerical results are consistent with the above observed
trends of luminosity  dependent dynamical properties of elliptical galaxies at least in a
qualitative manner For example the observed trend that the galactic core radius is more
 58 
likely to be larger for the more luminous elliptical galaxy can be naturally explained by the
present merger model that more luminous ellipticals are formed by galaxy major merging
between more luminous spirals The rst reason for this is that since more luminous spirals
initially are more likely to have larger cores or smaller central phase space density as is
implied by the Freemans law and the relation between galactic luminosity and scale-length
eg McGaugh and Blok 1997 galaxy mergers between spirals with larger cores are more
likely to become ellipticals with larger cores or smaller central phase space density The
second reason is that more luminous galaxy mergers are less dissipative owing to the more
rapid consumption of interstellar gas and consequently become ellipticals with less degree
of central concentration Hence the luminosity-dependent central structure in elliptical
galaxies could reect the luminosity-dependent dynamical structure of disk galaxies and the
star formation history of galaxy mergers Our numerical results imply furthermore that any
particular physical processes such as the dynamical heating of the central cores by binary
black holes Ebisuzaki Makino  Okumura 1991 are not necessarily required for the
formation of larger cores in more luminous elliptical galaxies Thus our numerical results
strongly suggest that the luminosity-dependent dynamical structure of elliptical galaxies can
be understood in the context of the dierence in luminosity-dependent dynamical structure
of progenitor disks and the star formation history between gas-rich galaxy mergers This
furthermore indicates that total amount of gaseous dissipation and the degree of violent
relaxation during merging both of which are determined basically by the star formation
history of galaxy mergers are important factors which can aect the luminosity-dependent
morphological structural and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies The validity of
the suggested point of view that luminosity-dependent dynamical structures of elliptical
galaxies are essentially ascribed to the dierence in the star formation history between
elliptical galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging has been also investigated by Bekki
 Shioya 1997b in the context of the origin of the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies
 59 
Although more elaborated numerical studies including more realistic implementation of star
formation and gaseous dissipation are denitely required for conrming the validity of the
results obtained in the present study the merger scenario that more luminous ellipticals
are formed by dissipative and major galaxy merging between more luminous spirals seems
likely in the context of the reproduction of the observed luminosity-dependent dynamical
properties of elliptical galaxies
B3 Self-consistency of the present merger model
Our nal goal is to construct a more realistic model which can clearly explain both
the structural and kinematical properties such as the origin of the fundamental plane

and color Peletier et al 1990 Davies et al 1991 Therefore it is essential to discuss
how successfully the present merger model has actually reproduced or would reproduce
both the dynamical and kinematical properties and chemical and photometric ones in a
self-consistent way What is the most vital in addressing this crucial issue is to try to
explain both the luminosity  dependent dynamical and chemical properties of elliptical
galaxies Since the present study is the rst step toward the complete understanding of
elliptical galaxy formation we rst make only a qualitative comparison of the present
results with observational one then we point out the advantages and disadvantages of the
present merger model in reproducing both the luminosity  dependent dynamical and
chemical properties of real elliptical galaxies In the following discussions we adopt the
assumption that galaxy mergers with larger CSF become more luminous elliptical galaxies
 60 
mainly because this assumption is realistic and essential for explaining the morphological
and kinematical properties of elliptical galaxies formed by galaxy merging Bekki  Shioya
1997a b
As is described in details by Bekki  Shioya 1997a b more luminous elliptical
galaxies formed by dissipative galaxy merging with star formation are less rotationally
supported less compact less strongly self-gravitating and more likely to have boxy
isophotal shape In the present study more luminous elliptical galaxies are found to be more
likely to be redder in global color than less luminous ones These obtained results concerning
the luminosity dependence of structural dynamical and photometric properties agree at
least qualitatively with the observed trends of elliptical galaxies in a self-consistent manner
These results strongly suggest that both the origin of luminosity-dependent dynamical and
morphological structure and that of the luminosity-dependent chemical photometric and
spectroscopic properties in elliptical galaxies are closely associated with the star formation
history in particular with the rapidity of star formation in galaxy mergers Furthermore
these results imply that dissipative galaxy merging with star formation which might be the
most frequently occurred in higher redshift has a number of advantages in reproducing the
nature of elliptical galaxies than we have previously expected
What we should note here is that the present merger model also has a number of
problems concerning the self-consistent reproduction of structural and chemical properties
of elliptical galaxies One of the problems that should be foremost resolved is on the
luminosity dependence of the central surface brightness or density and that of the central
stellar metallicity in elliptical galaxies Observational studies have revealed that more
luminous elliptical galaxies show both less luminous central or eective surface brightness
as is indicated by the Kormendy relation eg Djorgovski et al 1996 and the larger
central stellar metallicity as is indicated by Mg2 -  relation Burstein et al 1988 This
 61 
fundamental tendency of elliptical galaxies has not yet be reproduced by the present merger
model because the present model predicts that more luminous elliptical galaxies show
less luminous central surface and larger cores brightness but the smaller central stellar
metallicity compared with less luminous ones This sort of failure can be seen also in the
dissipative collapse models of Larson 1975 and Carlberg 1984 in which elliptical galaxies
with larger central stellar metallicity show more luminous central surface brightness or
smaller cores We consider these apparent failures are probably due to the ill approximation
of the adopted instantaneous recycling in which chemical enrichment is assumed to proceed
considerably faster than the dynamical evolution Actually the instantaneous recycling
approximation is expected to give an undesirable result to less luminous elliptical galaxies
in which the dynamical time-scale of the systems is comparable or only slightly larger than
the typical life-time of massive stars a few 107 yr Specically for less luminous galaxies
dynamical evolution such as the violent relaxation and redistribution of angular momentum
of gas and stars which plays a vital role in transferring and mixing dynamically chemical
components probably nishes earlier before the onset of ecient chemical enrichment driven
by type II supernovae As a result of this the dynamical transfer of chemically enriched
components into the inner region of galaxies which determines the magnitude of the central
stellar metallicity are less likely for less luminous elliptical galaxies This indicates the ratio
of the typical time-scale of chemical enrichment a few 107 yr to the dynamical time-scale
and its luminosity dependence are more essential for the chemodynamical evolution of less
luminous elliptical galaxies This kind of chemical evolution expected for less luminous
ellipticals mergers is probably not modeled by the present chemodynamical model in a
proper way accordingly the present model with instantaneous recycling should be greatly
modied to a more realistic one Hence it is our future and essential study to consider the
importance of the ratio of the time-scale of chemical enrichment to the dynamical time-scale
in elliptical galaxy formation and then to investigate again whether or not the remaining
 62 
problem of the present merger model can be resolved in the more sophisticated models of
chemodynamical evolution
Thus the present numerical study suggests that merger remnants with larger central
metallicity are more likely to show larger central surface density which appears to disagree
with the observational trend of real elliptical galaxies This apparent failure of the
present merger model accordingly leads us to the conclusion that other important physical
process associated with dissipative galaxy merging such as the thermal and dynamical
feedback eects of star formation should be included for more successful comparison with
the observational results The alternative conclusion is that the instantaneous recycling
approximation adopted in the present study could not be so appropriate for analyzing both
chemical and dynamical evolution in galaxy mergers especially for less luminous galaxy
mergers in which typical time-scale of chemical enrichment is comparable or larger than the
dynamical time-scale of the mergers
