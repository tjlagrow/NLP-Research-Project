Abstract
We present a brief discussion of the evolution of disk galaxy stellar masses
sizes rotation velocities and star formation rates over the last eight billion years
Recent observations have failed to detect signicant evolution in the stellar mass
Tully-Fisher relation stellar masssize relation and the stellar mass function of
disk galaxies Yet most z  1 star formation is in disks and this star formation
would be expected to drive a rapid growth of the total stellar mass and therefore
mass function of disks in the last eight billion years Such a build-up is not seen
instead a rapid build-up in the total stellar mass in non-star-forming spheroid-
dominated galaxies is observed Large numbers of disk-dominated galaxies are
systematically shutting off their star formation and building up a spheroid or
losing a disk in the epoch 0  z  1

The evolution of disk galaxy scaling relations  eg the luminosityline-
width Tully-Fisher relation or the luminositysize or stellar masssize re-
lations  give insight into the evolution of the masses stellar populations
and angular momentum contents of galaxy disks Luminosity and stellar mass
functions give yet deeper insight as they show how galaxies populate these
scaling relations Here we present a very brief overview of some recent in-
sights into the evolution of disk galaxy scaling relations their stellar mass func-
tion and to explore the interplay between star formation and the growth of stel-
lar mass We will consider only z  1 or the last eight billion years or so given
a concordance cosmology m0  03 0  07 and H0  70 km s1 Mpc1
Non-evolution of disk galaxy scaling relations
The evolution of disk galaxy scaling relations has proven difcult to robustly
determine and some issues remain contentious
In some cases the Tully-
Fisher relation Vogt et al 1996 vs eg Boehm et al 2004 it is not clear
where the source of the discrepancies lie In other cases the luminositystellar
masssize relations eg Ravindranath et al 2004 vs Barden et al 2005 the
source of the discrepant interpretations has been resolved see the discussion
in Barden et al 2005
Barden et al 2005 present an analysis of the evolution of the disk galaxy
luminositysize and stellar masssize relation over the epoch 0  z  1 from
the HSTGEMS Galaxy Evolution from Morphology and SEDs Rix et al
2004 survey of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South They chart the evo-
lution of the distribution of disk sizes from z  0 using the SDSS to grad-
ually higher and higher redshift carefully quantifying the effects of surface
brightness dimming and incompleteness At z  11 the surface brightness
limit of GEMS starts to signicantly eat into the disk galaxy population there-
fore they limited their study to z  11 Using this sample of galaxies with
well-understood and modest completeness corrections they conclude that
there has been signicant evolution in the luminositysize relation such
that galaxies at z  1 have roughly 15 mag arcsec2 brighter rest-frame
B-band surface brightnesses than galaxies of equivalent luminosity to-
day and
that most of this evolution is attributable to the fading and reddening of
stellar populations as they age from z  1 to the present day ie there
is no detectable evolution in the stellar masssize relation for galaxies
with M  1010M
The evolution of the TullyFisher relation remains a contentious issue None-
theless important progress is still being made Novel contributions were made
recently by Conselice et al 2005 and Flores et al 2006 who presented stud-
ies of the z  1 evolution of the near-IR and stellar mass Tully-Fisher relations
Their analyses ruled out substantial evolution in the stellar mass Tully-Fisher
relation1
Also recently a number of groups have studied the evolution of the stellar
mass function of galaxies split either by morphological type or color These
1Conselice et al then use this as an argument that the dark matter content and baryonic content of disks
grow in lockstep arguing that the stars were a good probe of baryonic mass and the rotation velocity was
a good probe of dark mass Yet it is important to note that if the bulk of massive disks are maximum-disk
ie their baryonic content dominates their rotation velocity eg Kassin et al 2006 Kassin et al this
volume then one also expects no evolution in the stellar mass Tully-Fisher relation
Disk galaxy evolution
cuts are at a very general level largely equivalent  most red galaxies are
morphologically early-type and the bulk of blue galaxies are morphologically
late-type out to z  07 at least Strateva et al 2001 Bell et al 2004 A
general conclusion is that the stellar mass function of bluedisk galaxies does
not evolve signicantly since z  1 see Brinchmann  Ellis 2000 for rst
indications of this result Bundy et al 2006 Borch et al 20062
It would appear that none of the scaling relations dening disk galaxy struc-
ture or dynamics or indeed the space density of disk galaxies at a given mass
signicantly change in the last eight billion years It is as if the disk galaxy
population resolved to do nothing for the last eight billion years except age
Yet there is one observational constraint that has not yet been brought to
bear on the problem which seems to give interesting and incisive insight the
evolution of disk galaxy star formation rates
Eight billion years of star formation in disks
With the advent of Spitzer it has been possible to explore the star formation
rates of galaxies at z  1 with unprecedented accuracy fully 50 of the
z  1 cosmic SFR has been resolved into individual galaxies with deep 24m
surveys Le Floch et al 2005 Zheng et al 2006 One key result is that the
bulk of z  1 star formation is in disk galaxies the order-of-magnitude decline
in cosmic SFR is the result of processes which are shaping the evolution of disk
galaxies Bell et al 2005 Melbourne et al 2005 Wolf et al 2005
We explore this issue further in Fig 1 Here we show the contribution of
different types of galaxy to the cosmic SFR and stellar mass budget at z  1
such an analysis requires the assumption of a universally-applicable stellar
IMF and we adopt the parameterization of Chabrier 2003 in what follows
Full circles show the total SFRstellar mass Open diamonds show the esti-
mated contribution from early-type galaxies These were selected to be on the
red sequence and have concentrated light proles with Sersic indices n  25
derived from HSTACS F850LP imaging data from GEMS This selection is
analogous to that used by McIntosh et al 2005 for their study of the early-
type galaxy stellar masssize relation Asterisks show the contribution all other
galaxies dominated by n  25 galaxies ie less concentrated typically disk-
dominated galaxies with a small contribution from blue galaxies with n  25
which are often blue disks with signicant bulges or ongoing galaxy merg-
ers Other ways of splitting the sample  eg a pure n  25 split a pure
2The oft-cited  15 magnitude fading of the characteristic luminosity L of the disk galaxy population
from z  1 to the present is more-or-less accounted for by the expected fading and reddening of the ageing
stellar populations in blue star-forming disks thus the characteristic stellar mass of disks does not appear
to evolve a large amount during the last 8 billion years Lilly et al 1995 Willmer et al 2006 Borch et al
2006 Blanton 2006
bluered split or splits by visual morphology  produce qualitatively similar
results to those shown in Fig 1 The total stellar mass budget is derived from
three COMBO-17 photometric redshift survey elds see Borch et al 2006
the type-split stellar mass and all SFR budgets used in the argument below were
derived from only one eld the extended Chandra Deep Field South for which
both HSTACS data and Spitzer data were available Uncertainties from cos-
mic variance have been estimated by exploring eld-to-eld variation in stellar
mass budget of the red and blue galaxy populations from COMBO-17 The
z  0 point is taken from the SDSS2MASS Bell et al 2003
In the upper panel of Fig 1 we show the evolution of the cosmic star forma-
tion rate for all galaxies derived from Spitzer 24m observations solid circles
Le Floch et al 2005 Bell et al in prep and grey error bars show the compi-
lation from Hopkins 2004 The asterisks show the evolution of the integrated
SFR density in bluedisk-dominated galaxies the diamonds the contribution
from red early-type galaxies It is clear that the bulk of star formation is in
blue and disk galaxies at all z  1
What do these SFRs predict for the build-up of stellar mass in disks This
is explored in the lower panels of Fig 1 where we compare the evolution of
the integrated stellar mass density with the integral of the star formation rate
of different galaxy populations The evolution of the integrated stellar mass
density in all galaxies solid circles blue and disk galaxies asterisks and red
spheroid-dominated galaxies diamonds is shown The lines show the integral
of the cosmic SFR clearly the evolution of the total cosmic SFR solid line
is compatible with the observed build-up in cosmic stellar mass density from
z  1 to the present day with some 40 of stars being formed in this epoch
Disk galaxies contain the bulk of the star formation Thus if one assumes
that the disk galaxy population is a closed box ie all stars ever formed in
disks stay there then one can predict the growth in the total disk stellar mass
density This result is shown by the dotted line It is difcult to argue that this
mismatch is some kind of catastrophic failure of the stellar massSFR estima-
tion methodology completely standard calibrations were used and the integral
of the cosmic SFR indeed reproduces well the build-up of stellar mass at z  1
Instead it is clear that the disk galaxy population is not a closed box The key
to understanding this issue lies in exploring the stellar mass growth in spheroid-
dominated galaxies the total stellar mass in spheroids increases signicantly
from z  1 to the present day while almost no star formation happens in the
spheroid-dominated galaxy population Large numbers of disk-dominated
galaxies are systematically shutting off their star formation and building
up a spheroid or losing a disk in the epoch 0  z  1 The physical
processes that are responsible for these transformations are as yet unclear and
might include bar-induced instabilities merging with satellites or companions
or suppression of star formation by ram-pressure stripping or galactic winds

lines split into contributions from the red morphologically early-type galaxies diamonds and
dashed lines and all other galaxies asterisks and dotted lines dominated by disk galaxies
In the uppermost panel determinations of cosmic SFR are shown also in grey adopted from
Hopkins 2004 In the lower panels the data points show the observed evolution of stellar
mass as a function of redshift The solid line shows the predicted build-up of stellar mass
assuming the star formation history shown by the solid line in the upper panel assuming for gas
recycling it is clear that the integral of the cosmic star formation history predicts the cosmic
evolution of stellar mass at z  1 reasonably accurately The dotted line shows the predicted
evolution of total stellar mass assuming that all stars that form in bluedisk galaxies remain in
bluedisk galaxies ie if the blue cloud evolves like a closed box The dashed line shows the
corresponding evolution for early-type galaxies
Discussion
This has important implications for how one interprets the non-evolution of
disk galaxy scaling relations Whereas one could have without the measure-
ment of the disk galaxy SFRs postulated that disks were a non- or slowly-
evolving population the evolution of such expected rapid star formation-
driven build-up in mass makes this interpretation meaningless
Instead as
low-mass disk galaxies are growing in mass as they must to replace the disks
sacriced for the ever-growing spheroid-dominated galaxy population they
must be growing also in rotation velocity to preserve the non-evolving Tully-
Fisher relation and size to preserve the non-evolving masssize relation 
at least in an average sense Furthermore in this picture the non-evolution of
the stellar mass function of disks is a vital constraint any mechanism which is
transforming disks into spheroids must take disks from the stellar mass func-
tions at such a rate that they can be approximately replaced by star formation-
related growth of lower-mass disks
