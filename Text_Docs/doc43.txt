Abstract
By analytically continuing the time variable in a black hole background and requiring
unitary evolution it is found that quantum mechanical states at the horizon develop a
thermal factor under suitable identication of the physical time The thermal factor is
found to be determined exactly by the Hawkings temperature This can be interpreted
as the Hawkings radiation and oers an alternative understanding to the process and the
information loss puzzle

1 Introduction
It has been about twenty years since Hawking 1 rst put forward his argument of
black hole radiation In his semi-classical calculation it was shown that pair creation in
black holes produces thermal radiation The temperature of radiation is inversely pro-
portional to the mass of the black hole Therefore a black hole will radiate at an ever-
increasing rate until it nally reaches the Planck mass where the semiclassical approxima-
tion breaks down This implies information loss and destruction of quantum coherence
Physicists have been puzzled by this phenomenon since then Eorts in the past has not
been successful in resolving this paradox Perhaps we need to look at the problem from a
completely new perspective
The relation between thermodynamics and quantum mechanics was realized soon
after quantum eld theory was developed It was found that the partition functions in
thermodynamics and those in quantum eld theories are related by a phase rotation of
kB T  Hence there is a corresponding
2 in the complex plane of the time variable or
result in thermodynamics for each calculation in quantum eld theory and vice versa
Moreover a thermal background can be created by shifting the time by an imaginary
number We also know that there is no statistical mechanics in purely classical physics
since counting the number of states needs the energy levels of a system to be quantized
It is therefore not unnatural to speculate that these two seemingly dierent branches of
physics are somehow related to each other
With the aforementioned borne in mind in this paper we will study the analytical
continuation of the time variable in a black hole background and look for its relation to
the thermodynamical properties of the black hole It is found that by requiring unitary
evolution a quantum mechanical state escaping from the horizon will change its norm
when described by the physical time The new norm of the state diers from the original
one by a thermal factor of Hawkings temperature This is interpreted as the Hawkings
radiation process
We will rst present the argument in the two dimensional black hole case Then we
will repeat the same procedure to the four dimensional black holes The arguments are
on parallel lines The dilaton black hole model serves as an illustration and warm up
exercise while considering the Kruskal coordinates in the four dimension case justies our
denition of the physical time However the calculation in the four dimensional case is
found to be just as simple although most of the motivations are initiated from studying
the two dimensional model
2 Energy and time in the complex plane
In traditional quantum mechanics we dene the Hamiltonian operator as complex
valued in general We also restrict the time to be real We then examine the condition for
the theory to be physical either by requiring energy conservation or unitary time evolution
Unitarity implies that the time translation operator
U  eiHt
is unitary ie U U   1 This in turn requires the Hamiltonian H to be hermitian What
we are trying to accomplish in this paper is to relax the restriction on the time t by also
allowing it to be complex valued The motivation and justication for doing this will be
explained soon At the same time we still require unitary time evolution Now H alone
may not be hermitian instead the product Ht is required to be hermitian if our theory is
to be physical
Now we turn to the discussion on the time t We know that almost all the results of
quantum eld theory can be translated into that of thermodynamics simply by analytically
continuing the time into the complex plane in fact the imaginary axes Therefore it
is not surprising at all if we start to talk about complex time by analytical continuation
and nd some thermal properties at the end
In general relativity this becomes most
transparent when we consider the black hole solution of the Einsteins equation in the
Kruskal coordinates when we continue the Kruskal time into the horizon r  2M 
The crucial point of our argument lies in the identication of the physical time We
propose that the ducial observer always sees the time as a real number As one looks
beyond the horizon it is inevitable to make measurements with physical time as otherwise
there is no communication with the asymptotic observer However the Hamiltonian stays
the same and Hawkings radiation follows as a result of non-hermiticity This will be made
more precise as we study the examples in the following sections A dierent identication
of the physical time certainly produces dierent physics We will also discuss about this
possibility later on
3 Hawkings radiation in dilaton black holes
Now let us see what happens when we consider uctuations at the boundary of the
two dimensional dilaton black hole We will work in the model and use the convention
as in 2 where the boundary of the black hole space time is described by the trajectory
x x The variables x x are called Kruskal coordinates They are related to the
ducial Minkowski coordinates by
 x  ert
with  being the cosmological constant We see here that for real r t x resides in the
fourth quadrant   A typical black hole solution has boundary trajectory asymptote
of the form
2 x x  A
near the future innity I where A is a positive constant The horizon is the line x  0
Studies show that the trajectory turns space-like at certain incoming energy ux 3 2
where the horizon in Kruskal coordinate x is shifted correspondingly Black hole sets in
when x  0 and information is lost It was unclear how to deal with waves propagating
beyond the horizon and it was concluded that information is loss But suppose we do
look beyond the horizon what will we see
It was found 4 2 that there is a horizon shift induced for incoming matter ux
Therefore considering a small shift in the horizon is equivalent to considering perturba-
tion from the incoming matter ux Because the position of the horizon is dynamically
determined by the amount of incoming energy ux
Let us suppose that there is a shift  where   0 ie before making the shift
the coordinate  x runs from  to  instead of  to 0 In two dimensional models
this shift shows that a black hole has been formed The shift is determined by requiring
that the future innity I corresponds to the point  x x   0  Then some of
the matter that formed the black hole must have travelled to a space-time point with a
positive value of  x     The magnitude of the value  indicates how far beyond
the horizon it has traversed In this paper it suces to consider small 
Look at the space-time point  x   with 0     Considering uctuations
just beyond the horizon means we are looking at small  Equivalently we can consider a
virtual state created right beyond the horizon r  0 and observe its propagation aka
tunneling through it In the ducial coordinates this is the point
t  
log  i
 In the model of 2 it corresponds to the super-critical case where the incoming massless
scalar eld energy is large enough to make a temporal black hole
Requiring unitary time evolution we have
unitarity condition 34 implies that
Ht  H t
H  E  i
  
Next we will identify the physical time Since the physical time is an observable it
should be real valued Dene the physical time tphy as
tphy  
log x x
This reduces with 31 for negative x
Noting that  x  1 at the horizon r  0 we then have the physical time beyond
the horizon as
T  
We see here that   0 corresponds to T   so that T increases with  Note also
that   0 is also the point x  0 or t   Therefore the direction of time ow is
preserved T starts at where t ends
Let us now consider a quantum mechanical state from behind the horizon We will
use the analytical Hamiltonian H and the physical time T  One way of perceiving this is
by comparing it to the uncertainty principle To construct the time evolution operator
we need to know both H and t Once t is determined to be the physical time T  H is
uncertain up to a phase It is equivalent to determine H rst and we will arrive at the
same result But for any experiment to be done it is better to have a well-dened time
The evolution of the state   is as follows
T   eiHT   
Putting in H and T we nd
T   eiEte ET
log   
This means that
   e 2E
  T T  
This result shows that any state when passing through the boundary has its norm de-
creased by a thermal factor of the Hawkings temperature kBTH  
2  In other words
pair creation from the horizon is thermal There is something very special about 311 
it does not depend on the time T  This implies that the same eect occurs for tunneling
from dierent sites of T  In classical mechanics we do not have wave travelling backward in
time as in this case from T to  but it is perfectly legitimate in quantum mechanics
when tunneling eect occurs
How should we interpret this in terms of particle creation The particle virtual from
the perspective of the ducial observer has made its way tunneled through the horizon
We do not expect to see this normally since it would take an innite amount of time for
anything to achieve this Because the time T describes the space-time beyond the horizon
which is causally disconnected from any asymptotic observer However the fact that the
amplitude does not depend on  indicates that it may just have reappeared at the point
  0 overcoming the innite time delay This means that in the future innity I
 x    0 thermal radiation of temperature TH is detected Here we need to clarify
one more point For propagation on the same side of the horizon the norm of the state is
1 since it is possible to dene a real time and a hermitian Hamiltonian But that does
not tell us anything because there are causally disconnected space-time and irrelavant to
our discussion here There is a phase change when a black hole is formed The fact that
our result is T independent means that the creation is not a local one Instead particles
created right beyond the horizon immediately appear on the horizon where   0 or
T   And all of them are thermal with temperature TH 
What has happened to the particle There is one plausible explanation For any
particle trying to make its way out of the horizon a fraction of it 1  1
black hole only a fraction
managed to appear on the other side of the horizon There
 stays in the
is no violation to quantum mechanics since unitarity is a priori But there is Hawkings
radiation in the horizon of a black hole For the super-observer the scattering matrix is
still unitary since we have required U to be unitary in terms of his analytical time t and
As a last comment many other ways of identifying the physical time produce the
same result although we believe ours is the correct one For example the same physical
time can be derived if we dene T to be the real part of the complex time t
4 Four dimensional black holes
Now we discuss the realization of the results in the four dimension The assumptions
and arguments in this case is parallel to the two dimensional one Therefore here we will
keep it short and concise by avoiding redundancy in argument
The Kruskal coordinates in four dimensional black holes is dened as
x x  16M 2
x x  et2M
 1er2M
in which the Schwarzchilds metric is
ds2  
2M d xd x  r2d2
Here we see that real values of  x x resides in the fourth quadrant where r  2M  For
r  2M  ie beyond the horizon we have to analytically continue the Kruskal coordinates
into the complex plane The same prescription for the physical time beyond the horizon
as the previous section divides t into two coordinate patches The rst being the usual
denition 41 where t runs from  to  This is glued to the second coordinate patch
with  x x  eT 2M at the horizon From there time T is from  to  T starts
at where t ends Therefore the physical time dened in the previous section is in fact
physical
Studies have also shown that there are similar horizon shifts in the Kruskal coordinates
as in the two dimensional case when a black hole has been formed 5 This further justies
our assumption that horizon is not a sharply dened line and we can look beyond it by
analytical continuation
Therefore we can immediately write down the Hawkings temperature for the four
dimensional black holes By comparing the denitions of the Kruskal coordinates we see
that we have to replace  with 1
temperature for the four dimensional black holes is thus found to be kBTH  1
4M  where M is the mass of the black hole The Hawkings
8M  exactly
the same as what was already known
5 Discussion
To summarize there are two assumptions in our calculation and one interpretation
1 The product Ht is hermitian for unitarity requirement
2 When we look beyond the horizon once the the physical time T is identied the
analytical Hamiltonian H is used
3 Any virtual state created beyond the horizon if it is to escape from the black hole
and emerge to the observers side acquires a thermal factor in its norm This is interpreted
as the Hawkings radiation
It is not fully understood yet how assumptions 1 and 2 apply to other branches of
physics But they are very plausible assertions since we have already seen the striking
similarity between statistical mechanics and quantum eld theories
If our interpretation 3 is valid Hawkings radiation is simply an eect of coordinate
choice To make any measurement we are forced to use one coordinate for the physical time
and another for the Hamiltonian It is very similar to t Hoofts 6 argument involving
the innite red-shift between the local and asymptotic time Hawkings radiation in this
picture is a result of requiring unitary time evolution instead of violating it
correct prescription of energy and time unitarity is always preserved and we will never
see Hawkings radiation But the time for such observer is not a physical observable
If instead we try to measure physics in the physical time T  we will detect thermal
radiation as predicted by Hawking The reason for our seeing the innite amount of
radiation from black holes is merely an artifact of coordinate choice
It could also be argued that dimensional analysis may lead to similar results However
our results are exact while dimensional argument is always up to a constant Moreover
we have provided a possible physical origin for these eects
At last we should make it clear that this is only a tentative calculation The physical
origin of the assumptions and the validity of our interpretation of the result requires further
investigation We are convinced that it worths being written down because of its simplicity
and the surprising coincidence of the result with Hawkings calculation Even if this were
not true the calculation itself oers another aspect of studying the thermodynamical
property of black holes and a new way of looking at the problem
