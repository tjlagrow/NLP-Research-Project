Pairwise dwarf galaxy formation and galaxy
downsizing some clues from extremely
metal-poor Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies

Abstract Some of the extremely metal-poor Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies XBCDs
in the nearby universe form galaxy pairs with remarkably similar properties This
fact points to an intriguing degree of synchronicity in the formation history of these
binary dwarf galaxies and raises the question as to whether some of them form and
co-evolve pairwise or in loose galaxy groups experiencing recurrent mild interac-
tions and minor tidally induced star formation episodes throughout their evolution
We argue that this hypothesis offers a promising conceptual framework for the ex-
ploration of the retarded previous evolution and recent dominant formation phase of
1 Introduction
Various lines of evidence indicate that some among the extremely metal-poor
12logOH76 Blue Compact Dwarf BCD galaxies hereafter XBCDs in
the nearby universe are cosmologically young objects experiencing their dominant
formation phase since 13 Gyr and containing a small if any mass fraction of
ancient stars see eg 1 for a discussion The origin of the recent rapid assembly
of the stellar component of XBCDs is generally ascribed to strong interactions or
merging between gas-rich dwarf galaxies DGs having had undergone little previ-
ous star formation SF and chemical enrichment see eg 2
However the hypothesis of a chance encounter between two unrelated DGs does
not appear to be universally compelling This is because several XBCDs form galaxy
pairs with a small linear 2   60 kpc and velocity separation 1   6  their intrinsic
velocity dispersion of s  10 kms and most importantly they are strikingly simi-
lar with respect to their photometric structure luminosity-weighted stellar age htiL
and gas-phase metallicity One such example is the prototypical XBCD I Zw 18 and
its C component The former after subtraction of its extended nebular halo appears
as almost a mirror image of the latter with both galaxies being remarkably similar
with respect to their htiL  108 yr isophotal radius 0406 kpc at 26 mag
and exponential scale length a
100130 pc of their unresolved stellar host 3
Another example is offered by the young XBCD candidates SBS 0335-052 EW
differing by only 02 dex in their gas-phase metallicity 12logOH71   73

Such properties point to an intriguing degree of synchronicity in the evolutionary
history of nearly equal-mass XBCDs a fact that is difcult to reconcile with the tra-
ditional hypothesis of a chance encounter between two unrelated DGs They instead
raise the question as to whether some XBCDs form and co-evolve as galaxy pairs or
out of groups of low-mass baryonic entities that possibly reside within a common
dark matter DM halo and being exposed to perpetual mild mutual interactions
throughout their evolution If so a question that arises is whether this co-evolution
process can under certain conditions initially slow down the buildup of DGs and
at a late cosmic epoch favor a nearly synchronous dominant DG formation phase
Evidently this question is complex Even rough quantitative statements would re-
quire reasonable assumptions on galaxy statistics eg mass velocity and angular
momentum distribution and the effects of SF and close-by interactions in a loose
group of co-evolving DGs However an exploration of this hypothesis appears to be
of considerable interest both in the context of XBCD evolution and in the light of the
recent nding that a substantial fraction of late-type DGs in the Local Supercluster
form galaxy binaries 7
2 Pairwise dwarf galaxy formation and evolution
The following discussion attempts to delineate with simple heuristic arguments ba-
sic aspects of the star formation history SFH of DGs undergoing recurrent mild
interactions in a loose galaxy group It is restricted to the sizeable population of
late-type DGs in the eld well outside the higher-density cosmic network and does
not consider strong interactions or merging The discussion is based on merely two
considerations The rst one is related to the triggering of SF through long-distance
20100 kpc tidal interactions 8 see eg 9 for an enlightening discussion on the
Icke mechanism as possible triggering agent of starbursts in BCDs The second one
is based on the empirical fact that the 3D gas distribution of DGs is related to their
mass M and luminosity eg 10 11 more massive DGs evolve within an oblate
or even disklike gaseous reservoir e  e c whereas the gas halo of lower-mass DGs
is less oblate or nearly spherical e  e c where e denotes the gas vertical-to-radial
extent and e c is a mean value for late-type DGs An implicit perhaps not undoubted
assumption is that the dependence of e on M settles early enough and holds through-
out the DG evolution Note that the 3D gas geometry  e  has been taken into
account in several theoretical studies exploring the energy requirements for galac-
tic winds from isolated DGs hosting a central starburst eg 12 and references
therein Some of the considerations below derive from these studies
For the sake of illustration one may consider the case of tidally triggered SF in
a binary system consisting of a higher- and lower-mass DG A and B with M  Mc
e  e c and M  Mc e  e c respectively In system A small-scale SF-driven
outows of hot gas can likely escape relatively unimpeded along the steep vertical
density gradient of its gas disk causing a rather moderate damage to it and leaving
a signicant fraction of the cold gas reservoir intact and susceptible to ensuing self-
propagating or tidally triggered SF Most probably recurrent weak interactions will

therefore enhance the average SF efciency of a higher-mass DG and accelerate the
buildup of its stellar component The opposite will presumably be the case for the
lower-mass nearly spherical system B in the absence of a substantial vertical gas
density gradient and depending on the energy injection rate and overall geometry
bubbles of hot gas may remain trapped within the ambient cold gas over their long
cooling time or grow and merge leading to its large-scale disruption In either case
even a minor episode of tidally induced SF may result in a long-lasting quenching of
SF activities The same is obviously true for a pair of low-mass weakly interacting
DGs BB
It is straight forward to generalize the above considerations to an ensample of
DGs in a galaxy group spanning a range in M and e  The essential cumulative effect
of galaxy co-evolution in the specic context will likely be the accelerated buildup
of higher-mass DGs and the retarded evolution of lower-mass systems resulting in
a lower SF efciency higher present gas-mass fraction and younger htiL for the
latter and vice versa Therefore in the scenario sketchily delineated here forma-
tion and co-evolution of DGs in loose pairs and groups provides a mechanism that
contributes to galaxy downsizing by amplifying inherent mass-related galaxy evo-
lution biases This hypothesis is consistent with a nearly synchronous evolution for
equal-mass galaxies and vice versa with a decreasing htiL with decreasing M and
with the presence of a faint substrate of old stars in the lowest-mass DGs provided
that they remain bound to the DG halo
The above considerations additionally suggest that not only the local DG density
but also the larger-scale a few 100 kpc  l environmental density is a relevant pa-
rameter of DG evolution Since tidally induced SF episodes are probably tiny brief
and asynchronous important pieces of evidence regarding the long-term impact of
the environment on DG evolution may evade detection in studies relying on the nar-
row visibility time-window of the Ha emission line only Differential studies of the
SFH for a representative probe of eld DGs over a volume  l3 might thus be of
considerable interest Further insights might emerge from searches for post-starburst
DG candidates with eg LOFAR 13
Whether or not the gradual rise of SF in an ensemble of co-evolving DGs will
be succeeded by a dominant phase of galaxy formation at a later cosmic epoch as
probably is the case for several XBCDs is unclear A conceivable hypothesis is that
only DGs with specic intrinsic and environmental properties can develop along
such an extreme evolutionary pathway Various lines of evidence suggest that the
SFH of eld DGs is largely inuenced by the central density r  of their evolving
stellar component 3 and references therein see also 15 for early theoretical work
exploring the effect of a dense stellar background on gas stability conditions This is
also supported by the fact that the r  of starbursting DGs BCDs is by typically an
order of magnitude higher than that of DGs undergoing quasi-continuous SF dwarf
irregulars 14 However since stars are being inherited the kinematics of the gas
out of which they are born r  hence the compactness of a DG depends to some
extent on the exchange of angular momentum between weakly interacting gaseous
halos in a co-evolving ensemble of DGs Nature and nurture are tightly woven
3 Synopsis
Polychronis Papaderos
This work is motivated by the fact that some of the extremely metal-poor young
XBCD candidates known in the nearby universe reside in galaxy pairs with strik-
ingly similar properties This points to an intriguing synchronicity in the formation
history of such binary galaxies and leaves space for alternatives to the standard hy-
pothesis according to which the rapid starburst-driven evolution of XBCDs is trig-
gered by recent chance encounters between two unrelated gas-rich dwarf galaxies
DGs An alternative hypothesis proposed here is that some XBCDs form and co-
evolve as pairs or in groups of low-mass baryonic units experiencing perpetual mild
interactions throughout their evolution If so a question that arises is whether this
co-evolution process can under certain conditions initially slow down the buildup
of DGs and at a late cosmic epoch favor a nearly synchronous dominant phase
of galaxy formation as seen in XBCDs Based on simple heuristic arguments we
argue that the co-evolution scenario offers a tenable working hypothesis for the ex-
ploration of DG evolution in the eld It provides a mechanism that likely amplies
galaxy downsizing trends through the acceleration of the evolution of more massive
systems and the deceleration of the evolution of less massive ones This scenario
is consistent with the presence of a faint substrate of ancient stars in most XBCDs
and with a nearly synchronous evolution of equal-mass DGs and vice versa The
discussion given here is admittedly over-simplied Its main goal however is not to
provide conclusive answers but to highlight some of the questions raised by XBCDs
and stimulate theoretical work on these enigmatic objects
