Irregulars Overcoming Selection Bias

Abstract The Hubble Deep Fields represent our best opportunity for probing
galaxy evolution over a substantive look-back time However as with any dataset
the HDFs are prone to selection biases These biases are extremely severe beyond
z  125 such that a meaningful interpretation of generic galaxy evolution is not
possible We can however extract well dened volume-limited samples at z  1
The data are entirely consistent with passivenull-evolution for ellipticals spirals
and irregulars however this concluion is tempered by small number statistics Alas
stringent constraints on galaxy evolution await an order of magnitude increase in
the number of HDFs
1 Introduction
The two Hubble Deep Fields HDF provide our deepest optical insight into
the near and far universe Each contains approximately 750 galaxies for which
magnitudes colours photometric redshifts and morphologies have been de-
termined 1 The data have been used by many groups to construct a picture
of the assembly and evolution of galaxies However every dataset the HDFs
included suer from selection biases at some level Here I hope to briey
highlight the severity of these selection biases and to provide some sugges-
tions as to how to test for and monitor these biases In particular I advocate
the use of the Bivariate Brightness Distribution BBD as a means of probing
galaxy evolution while also tracking the biases which plague our ability to
decipher deep data Finally I put forward my own cautious conclusions as to
the evolution of ellipticals spirals and irregulars since z1
2 Selection Bias
Galaxies exist over a vast dynamic range in both luminosity and in surface
brightness Any dataset has an apparent magnitude limit a surface bright-
ness detection limit and size limits which together create a selection window
2 We view of the galaxy population through this selection window Dif-
ferent surveys with diering limitations will sample dierent regions of the
galaxian parameter-space Unless these biases are monitored discrepancies
will manifest between surveys as are seen for example in measures of the
local luminosity function 3 These concerns become more paramount when

one compares local and deep data as such biases will cause discrepancies that
may erroneously be interpreted as evolution Additionally as these selection
biases are all distance dependent the selection window varies such that com-
parisons within a single dataset are also susceptible The most important of
these biases is Malmquist Bias - ie as we go fainter we select against rstly
low luminosity systems then normal systems and eventually giant systems
An analogous bias Disney Bias 4 works in a similar way but in terms of a
galaxys absolute surface brightness such that lower surface brightness sys-
tems are preferentially lost rst etc Neglecting either Malmquist or Disney
Bias leads to misleading results and as both biases are ever present it is
vital that we as a community demonstrate the robustness of our data to
these biases prior to interpretation Fig 1 shows two visualisations of the
HDF data highlighting the severity of both the Malmquist bias left and
the Disney bias right The dashed lines shows the location of the canonical
non-evolving zero-redshift L point
Fig 1 These two plots M v z left and  v z right highlight the severe eect of
Malmquist- and Disney- Bias which impinge dene the selection window through
which we view the galaxy population at any redshift The two selection limits
dene the uncertainty due to the range of possible K-corrections Solid points are
spectrscopic redshifts circles are ellipticals squares spirals and triangles irregulars
The conclusion we must draw from Fig 1 is that the HDF suers from
severe bias beyond z1 for the spectroscopic samplesolid points and be-
yond z125 for the photometric sample Any statistical measurement of
luminosity functions star-formation history evolution etc will therefore be
incomplete and increasingly misleading beyond z125 So does the mean
Evolution and Selection Bias
star-formation of the Universe really peak at z15 and then turn down 
Fig 1 convinces me that we simply dont know until we look into the un-
observed regions Looking at Fig 1 it is also easy to see why one might be
drawn to the conclusion that galaxies were both more luminous and of higher
surface brightness in the past Again an alternative and more informed con-
clusion is that this interpretation may be purely due to the shifting selection
window - we can not say
The conclusion is that the Hubble Deep Fields lack the breadth in
luminosity and surface brightness beyond z125 to place mean-
ingful constraints on galaxy evolution
3 The Bivariate Brightness Distribution
Having concluded that a statistical investigation of galaxy evolution from the
HDFs is currently impossible beyond z125 this connes us to investigation
galaxy evolution at z  125 This is not to say that selection biases are
not present below z  125 but that they have not yet impinged upon the
canonical z0 L point Why is the L point so critical  mainly because
it is these galaxies which dominate the luminosity and mass density of the
local universe 5 To see where and whether they have to evolved we have to
be able to observe any positive- zero- and negative- evolution about this
Additional selection lines also exist which cannot be shown on Fig 1
These are the size constraints due to the pixel size limiting the highest
measurable surface brightness and the eld-of-view size limiting the lowest
surface brightness object detectable for any absolute magnitude at some red-
shift To show these additional selection lines we must simultaneously look
at the M - plane our window into the galaxy population This plane is
known as the Bivariate Brightness Distribution and has up until no only be
derived for the Virgo cluster 6 - nevertheless it is a powerful tool
An example BBD taken from 2 is shown as Fig 2 This shows the HDF
window into the galaxy population at z03-05 The absolute magnitude
surface brightness and size selection lines are all shown and the shaded regions
indicate areas where the HDF is unable to detect galaxies The selection lines
are all redshift dependent and control our insight into the galaxy population
The selection lines are fairly straight-forward to estimate and are laid out in
detail in 2 Note that those galaxies which appear in the excluded region
must have erroneous photometric redshifts as their detection is impossible
As an aside the data show a strong luminosity-surface brightness relation and
a dearth of luminous low surface brightness galaxies 2
Using a bivariate brightness distribution we can extract volume-
limited samples for which the selection biases are well dened

4 The Evolution of Ellipticals Spirals and Irregulars
Having advocated a methodology to extract well controlled samples below
z  125 we are now in a good position to investigate galaxy evolution since
z  1 Fig 3 shows a sequence of BBDs for all the HDF ellipticals spirals
and irregulars from z0 to z1 for B  265 The striped areas show the
prohibited regions and galaxies that lie within these regions most likely have
erroneous photometric redshifts The density of galaxies which lie in these
excluded regions is of some concern and highlights the desperate need to
spectroscopically conrm late-types in particular
Finally then what does Fig 3 tell us about the evolution of the three
generic galaxy types The dashed line guides the eye and are tted to the
z03-06 bin for each type Two conclusions strike home 1 the HDF con-
tain insucient data for a detailed statistical analysis particularly when one
folds in the clustering uncertainty and 2 in all cases the 03-06 t matches
the 08-10 t
In closing it appears that the current outlook is somewhat depressing the
HDF is insuciently deep to probe the evolution of the generic population
beyond z  125 and the volume insucient to probe evolution below z 
125 We desperately need an order of magnitude more HDFs

For the moment the Occams razor solution must surely prevail
within the limited statistics available the HDF is consitent with
nullpassive evolution since z  1 beyond this even the HDF data
are dominated by selection eects
