ABSTRACT
We study ML evolution of early-type galaxies using dynamical modeling of resolved internal
kinematics This makes fewer assumptions than Fundamental Plane FP studies and provides a
powerful new approach for studying galaxy evolution We focus on the sample of 25 galaxies in
clusters at z  05 modeled in Paper I For comparison we compile and homogenize ML litera-
ture data for 60 nearby galaxies that were modeled in comparable detail The nearby sample obeys
logMLB  Z  S loge 200 km s1 with Z  0896  0010 S  0992  0054 and e the
eective velocity dispersion The z  05 sample follows a similar relation but with lower zeropoint
The implied ML evolution is  logMLz  0457  0046 random  0078 systematic con-
sistent with passive evolution following high-redshift formation This agrees with the FP results for
this sample by van Dokkum  van der Marel This conrms that FP evolution tracks ML evolution
which is an important verication of the assumptions that underly FP studies However while we nd
more FP evolution for galaxies of low e or low mass the dynamical ML evolution instead shows
little trend with e  We argue that this dierence can be plausibly attributed to a combination of
two eects a evolution in structural galaxy properties other than ML and b the neglect of rota-
tional support in studies of FP evolution The results leave the question open whether the low-mass
galaxies in the sample have younger population ages than the high-mass galaxies This highlights the
general importance in the study of population ages for complementing dynamical measurements with
broad-band colors or spectroscopic population diagnostics

1 INTRODUCTION
A stellar population of xed mass fades as it ages The
predicted mass-to-light ratio ML of a galaxy therefore
depends strongly on its age eg Bruzual  Charlot
2003 and ML measurements can constrain galaxy for-
mation times The ML of a galaxy cannot generally
be accurately constrained from characteristics of the ob-
served light eg broad-band colors and line-strength
indices alone This is because low-mass stars contribute
the bulk of the mass but only a small fraction of the
light Plausible variations in the assumed initial mass
function IMF can therefore change the ML without
aecting signicantly the characteristics of the observed
light eg Bell  de Jong 2001 Accurate measurements
of galaxy ML values therefore generally rely on dynam-
ical properties The speed at which stars or gas move
probes directly the gravitational force to which they are
subjected and therefore the mass of the system
The quality of the kinematical data for galaxies in the
local Universe as well as the methods by which their
dynamics can be modeled have steadily increased in so-
phistication over the years Large samples of reliable
ML measurements are now available from many stud-
ies in particular for early-type galaxies eg van der
Marel 1991 Magorrian et al 1998 Gebhardt et al 2003
Cappellari et al 2006a For these galaxies it is well es-
tablished that the ML inside an eective radius is rel-
atively constant and contains only a small contribution
from the dark halo eg Kronawitter et al 2000 There-
fore the inferred ML values are primarily driven by
the characteristics of the stellar population This situa-
tion diers considerably from the case for spiral galaxies
While mass proles have been derived for many spiral
galaxies eg Persic Salucci  Stel 1996 these pro-
les constrain primarily the properties of the dark halo
Considerable uncertainty remains on the ML of the stel-
lar population or alternatively on whether spiral galaxy
disks are maximal or not eg van Albada et al 1985
Courteau  Rix 1999
Uncertainties in the IMF for low-mass stars cause
considerable uncertainty in the predicted ML at xed
age So while accurate dynamical ML measurements
are available for many early-type galaxies these do not
uniquely constrain the age of their stellar population A
more powerful constraint is provided by the relative rate
at which the ML varies with time or alternatively red-
dMLMLdz  d logMLdz Because
this is a relative measure it depends less strongly on un-
certainties in the IMF for low-mass stars Of course a
dependence does remain on the exact shape of the IMF
for the higher-mass stars that produce most of the light
Nonetheless d logMLdz can be used to meaningfully
constrain the formation redshift of early-type galaxies
van Dokkum et al 1998
Studies of d logMLdz have so far relied primar-
van der Marel  van Dokkum
ily on measurements of the Fundamental Plane FP for
galaxies in the nearby and distant Universe van Dokkum
 Franx 1996 The FP is a tight planar relation be-
tween the global properties of early-type galaxies in any
three-dimensional parameter space spanned by quanti-
ties that measure the characteristic galaxy size velocity
dispersion and surface brightness Djorgovski  Davis
1987 Dressler et al 1987 For example one might take
the eective radius re  the average velocity dispersion
e inside the eective radius and the average surface
brightness Ie inside the eective radius The existence
of the FP can be understood as a combination of the
virial theorem and a power-law dependence of ML on
global galaxy properties Dressler et al 1987 Cappel-
lari et al 2006a A decrease in ML with redshift due
to stellar population eects corresponds to an increase
in Ie  and consequently a measurable decrease in the
zeropoint of the FP
Studies of FP evolution have provided important new
insights into the formation and evolution of early-type
galaxies see eg the following recent papers and ref-
erences therein Wuyts et al 2004 Woo et al 2004
Moran et al 2005 Treu et al 2005ab van der Wel et
al 2004 2005 di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 Jorgensen
et al 2006
In van Dokkum  van der Marel 2006
hereafter vDvdM06 we presented spectroscopy with
the Low Resolution Imager and Spectrograph LRIS on
Keck of some two dozen galaxies in the intermediate-
redshift z  05 clusters CL3C295 CL001616 and
CL160142 The sample galaxies were selected to
be bright enough for spectroscopy and visually classi-
ed from the Hubble Space Telescope HST images of
Dressler et al 1997 and Smail et al 1997 as early-type
and in most cases elliptical galaxies We measured the
integrated velocity dispersions of the galaxies and ana-
lyzed existing HST images to infer their characteristic
photometric properties This allowed a study of the FP
evolution of the three sample clusters We combined our
new results with existing FP data for eleven additional
clusters in the redshift range 018  z  128 as well as
samples of eld early-type galaxies in the redshift range
032  z  114 This provides the largest homogenized
analysis of FP evolution to date and implies a luminosity-
weighted mean star formation redshift z  201022
017 for
massive M  1011 M early-type galaxies in clusters
Field early-type galaxies in the same mass range are only
41  20 younger with z  195010
008 These results
assume that the IMF has a standard form and that
the progenitor bias described by van Dokkum  Franx
2001 does not depend on environment see vDvdM06
for details
The success and popularity of FP studies can be at-
tributed at least in part to the relative ease with which
such studies can be performed Only global galaxy prop-
erties need to be measured and modeling of the internal
structure of the sample galaxies is not required How-
ever there are important caveats In particular values
of d logMLdz determined from FP evolution are cor-
rect only if many simplifying assumptions are satised
Any potential evolution of global galaxy properties other
than ML ie e  re and e  ML  Ie r the
latter quantity being the average projected surface mass
density inside re  must either be absent or be such so as
to not aect the inferred ML evolution Also galaxies
must change homologously with redshift if at all they
must not evolve in quantities such as the shape of their
three-dimensional contours the shape of their density
prole with radius or the shape of their intrinsic dy-
namical structure The possibility that evolution in any
of these quantities may in fact occur has left the inter-
pretation of FP studies somewhat uncertain This possi-
bility has come into sharp focus through the fact that the
inferred ML evolution of massive early-type galaxies is
well t by models of passive evolution following formation
at high redshift and by the fact that there appears to be
only a small age dierence between massive early-type
galaxies in clusters and the eld vDvdM06 Although
models can be constructed that reproduce these results
eg Nagamine et al 2005 De Lucia et al 2006 they do
appear somewhat counter-intuitive given the paradigm of
hierarchical structure formation in the Universe More-
over there exist sophisticated semi-analytical models in
which the evolution of galaxy ML and FP zeropoint are
actually quite dierent Almeida Baugh  Lacey 2006
So there are many reasons to critically question whether
FP evolution does in fact uniquely trace ML evolution
The most direct way to address this question is to de-
termine ML values for individual distant galaxies in the
same way as has been done locally without resorting to
FP assumptions This requires construction of detailed
dynamical models for high-quality spatially resolved pho-
tometric and kinematic data With these goals in mind
we obtained spectroscopic data in vDvdM06 that was
deep enough to extract spatially resolved rotation curves
and velocity dispersion proles for the sample galaxies
in CL3C295 CL001616 and CL160142 In van der
Marel  van Dokkum 2006 hereafter Paper I we pre-
sented the kinematical proles and constructed detailed
dynamical models to interpret them The models are ax-
isymmetric and are based on solving the Jeans equations
of hydrostatic equilibrium under the assumption of a two-
integral distribution function f  f E Lz where E is
the energy and Lz the angular momentum around the
symmetry axis Fitting of the models to the available
HST imaging and observed kinematical proles yields
two quantities a normalized measure k of the galaxys
rotation rate and the ML of the stellar population in
rest-frame B band solar units The inferred values for
these quantities and their formal uncertainties were pre-
sented in Paper I The implications of the inferred ro-
tation rates were also discussed in that paper
present paper we interpret the inferred ML values To
do this we rst compile and homogenize a comparison
sample of galaxies in the local Universe with reliable
ML determinations from the literature We then com-
pare the ML values for the intermediate-redshift cluster
galaxies to those for the local comparison sample to ob-
tain a direct measure of the ML evolution of elliptical
galaxies
The layout of this paper is as follows Section 2 dis-
cusses the compilation of the local comparison sample
of galaxies with dynamically inferred ML values Sec-
tion 3 compares the ML values for the galaxies in the
intermediate-redshift sample from Paper I to those from
the local compilation This yields d logMLdz which
is compared to the FP evolution of the same sample de-
rived in vDvdM06 Section 4 discusses how the ML evo-

COMPARISON SAMPLE
21 Dynamical Modeling Sources
To study the ML evolution with redshift we need a
comparison sample of dynamically inferred ML values
for nearby early-type galaxies We restrict our atten-
tion here to ve detailed dynamical modeling studies
that addressed relatively large samples van der Marel
1991 hereafter vdM91 Magorrian et al 1998 here-
after M98 Kronawitter et al 2000 hereafter K00
Gebhardt et al 2003 hereafter G03 and Cappellari
et al 2006a hereafter C06 These studies dier from
each other in many ways both in terms of the quality and
nature of the data that were used and in the methods
and sophistication of the modeling In particular
 vdM91 and K00 used ground-based photometry
whereas M98 G03 and C06 used a combination
of both HST and ground-based photometry
 vdM91 M98 K00 and C06 used ground-based
spectroscopy whereas G03 used a combination of
ground-based and HST spectroscopy
 vdM91 M98 K00 and G03 used long-slit spec-
troscopy along one or more slit position angles
whereas C06 used fully two-dimensional integral-
eld spectroscopy
 K03 constructed spherical dynamical models they
restricted their sample to galaxies that are almost
circular in projection on the sky whereas vdM91
M98 G03 and C06 constructed axisymmetric mod-
 vdM91 and M98 constructed two-integral models
using the Jeans equations K00 constructed models
using an expansion around a set of known basis dis-
tribution functions and G03 and C06 constructed
fully general models using numerical orbit super-
position
 K00 included kinematical data in the central few
arcsec in their ts but did not allow for the possible
gravitational contribution of a central BH vdM91
also did not include a BH in the models but ex-
cluded the central few arcsec from the t C06 in-
cluded a BH of xed mass in the models but still
excluded the central few arcsec from the t and
M98 and G03 included BHs in their models and
tted their masses by using the data in the central
few arcsec
 vdM91 M98 G03 and C06 assumed a constant
value of ML with radius whereas K03 explicitly
included and optimized the contribution of a dark
 K03 determined ML values in the B-band M98
and G03 in the V -band1 vdM91 in the Johnson RJ
band and C06 in the I-band
We purposely included the results from all ve studies
rather than to retain merely a smaller sample composed
of the most recent or most accurate results One advan-
tage of this it that by comparing the results from the
dierent studies we are able to put rm limits on various
kinds of potential systematic uncertainties
22 Distances
It is important for our study to use a set of galaxy dis-
tances that is as accurate and homogeneous as possible
1 G03 reported the ML for one galaxy NGC 4564 in the I-
van der Marel  van Dokkum
For this we follow the example of G03 and C06 by us-
ing the compilation of Tonry et al 2001 hereafter T01
They obtained distances to 300 nearby galaxies mostly
of early type using the surface brightness uctuation
SBF method We removed from our initial sample of
81 total galaxies in vdM91 M98 K00 G03 and C06 the
17 galaxies that are not part of the T01 sample We re-
jected two more galaxies M31 and NGC 4594 because
they are not early-type galaxies which we dene here
as Hubble type T  0 and two other galaxies NGC
3384 and NGC 7332 for the reasons discussed in Sec-
tion 24 Table 2 lists the nal sample of 60 galaxies and
includes for each galaxy among other things the Hubble
type T and the adopted distance modulus and its uncer-
tainty The average distance for the sample galaxies is
216 Mpc This corresponds to hzi  0005 given the
Hubble constant listed in Section 1
There are 6 spiral galaxies with bulges in common be-
tween the SBF sample of T01 and the sample of galax-
ies for which Cepheid distances are available from the
HST Cepheid Key Project T01 calibrated the zeropoint
of their SBF method so as to set to zero the median
SBF vs Cepheid distance modulus residual for these 6
galaxies see Appendix B of Tonry et al 2000 This
was done using Cepheid results available in 2000 These
Cepheid distances have since been improved Freedman
et al 2001 Application of the same calibration method-
ology to the new Cepheid distances implies an SBF zero-
point that is larger by 006 mag eg Mei et al 2005
To account for this we added a correction T01  006
mag to all the distance moduli in T01 ie moving the
galaxies closer
For the purposes of our study it is important to under-
stand the accuracy with which the SBF and Cepheid dis-
tance scales have been aligned If one uses the weighted
average rather than the median statistic to align the 6
spiral galaxies then the SBF zeropoint changes by 012
Alternatively if one chooses not to align the distance
scales using individual galaxies at all but instead using
distances to groups of galaxies Ferrarese et al 2000
then this yields a change of 013 to the SBF zeropoint
Tonry et al 2000 And nally if one changes the SBF
zeropoint by 010 then better agreement is obtained
with predictions of population synthesis models Jensen
et al 20032 Based on these considerations we assume
that the systematic uncertainty on T01 is 013 mag
This corresponds to an uncertainty II  0026 in
logML
After its calibration to agree with Cepheids the SBF
distance scale is subject to all the same absolute distance
scale uncertainties that are inherent to the Cepheid dis-
tance scale These are summarized in Section 8 and Ta-
ble 14 of Freedman et al 2001 Most of the uncertain-
ties aect both the distances of local galaxies as well as
the inferred value of H0 They include the distance to
the LMC the photometric zeropoint of the HSTWFPC2
2 This zeropoint also happens to align the SBF distance scale
with the Cepheid distance scale if one assumes that the Cepheid
properties have no metallicity dependence But that is not what
Freedman et al 2001 assumed in their nal calibration Com-
parisons of TRGB and Cepheid distances also indicate a Cepheid
metallicity dependence Sakai et al 2004 The shift advocated by
Jensen et al 2003 was used by C06 in their study of ML values
of nearby galaxies
used for the Cepheid studies the accuracy of the redden-
ing and metallicity corrections applied to the Cepheids
and biases introduced by crowding and the magnitude
limit of the sample When added in quadrature as in
Freedman et al 2001 these eects introduce a 9 sys-
tematic uncertainty in the galaxy distances This corre-
sponds to a dierence III  0037 in logML This
uncertainty must be taken into account eg when com-
paring the ML values of local galaxies to the predictions
of stellar population synthesis models
The systematic Cepheid distance scale uncertainties
listed in the previous paragraph do not aect a rela-
tive comparison of ML values of nearby and distant
galaxies Any shift in the overall distance scale of the
Universe would aect both types of galaxies equally and
would therefore cancel out when evaluating a dierence
in logML The only distance scale uncertainties that
do aect such a comparison are those that impact the
estimate of H0 but not the Cepheid distances to local
galaxies These uncertainties have both a systematic and
a random component The systematic component is due
to cosmic variance ie the eect that local samples of
galaxies may yield an estimate of H0 that diers from
the true cosmic value as a result of bulk ows Based on
the discussion in Section 86 of Freedman et al 2001
we estimate this systematic component to be less than
2 on the scales z  01 over which Type Ia supernovae
have been used to calibrate H0 This corresponds to
a dierence IV  0009 in logML Random un-
certainties in H0 as opposed to systematic ones result
from nite sample sizes and scatter between results from
individual measurements Based on Section 7 of Freed-
man et al 2001 we estimate the random uncertainty
to be H0  4 km s1 Mpc1 This corresponds to
V  0023 in logML
23 Transformations to the B-band
For comparison to results at intermediate redshifts it is
important to have access to ML values in the rest-frame
B-band We therefore took the published values3 and
transformed them to B-band mass-to-light ratios MLB
for the distances D discussed in Section 22 using
MLB  MLF  DorigD 1004BF BF  1
Here MLF is the mass-to-light ratio in some other band
F for the distance Dorig as given in the original literature
source B  F is the relevant broad-band color of the
galaxy and B  F  is the color of the sun
For the transformation in equation 1 we needed colors
of the sample galaxies in various bands For B  V we
used the data of Faber et al 1989 hereafter F89 who
presented data for almost 600 nearby early-type galaxies
Their colors refer to apertures  30 in diameter around
the galaxy center The average color for the galaxies in
our sample is hB  V i  095 We used this average
color for the 8 galaxies in our nal sample for which a
B  V was needed but for which none was available from
3 Some studies list multiple values of the ML obtained under
slightly dierent assumptions For vdM91 we take the values la-
beled imp
in his Table 2 For K00 we take the central value
labeled best MLc
B  in their Table 7 For C06 we take the values
from their Schwarzschild models labeled MLSchw in their Table
1 as opposed to the values from their two-integral models

F89 For those galaxies for which we needed the color
B  RJ we used the transformation B  RJ  1839B 
V   0064 This was obtained from the equations B 
RJ  114B  RC  004 and V  RC  0613B 
V   0021 derived for early-type galaxies by Peletier et
al 1990 The subscripts in these equations refer to
the Johnson and the Cousins R-band respectively The
implied average color of the sample is hB  RJi  181
For the transformation of ML values in the I-band we
needed the B  I colors of the galaxies We calculated
those as the sum of B  V and V  I with the former
from F89 and the latter from T01 However a small cor-
rection was needed to the T01 colors because they apply
to an annular region around the galaxy center The dy-
namical ML determinations are therefore more heavily
weighted towards the galaxy center than the T01 colors
The central region that was excluded by T01 has an av-
erage diameter of 24 for those galaxies in our sample for
which the original ML was given in the I-band The
average color of these galaxies is hV  IT01i  116
Early-type galaxies become redder towards their centers
and this implies that the T01 colors are bluer than the
ones that should be used in equation 1 As a simple
correction for this we used V I  V IT01  We ap-
plied this equation on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis but the
small constant  was chosen to be a xed number To set
its value we compared to the predictions of stellar popula-
tion synthesis models The central colors hB  V i  095
and hB  RJi  181 of early-type galaxies in our sample
are t to within 001 mag by a 10997 yr old single age stel-
lar population with a Chabrier IMF of solar metallicity
and solar abundances ratios Bruzual  Charlot 20034
Such a population has V  I  120 Bruzual  Charlot
2003 To make the average T01 colors consistent with
these stellar population predictions we therefore choose
  004 The sign and size of this oset is consistent
with our understanding of the V  I color gradients in
the centers of early-type galaxies Lauer et al 2005
In equation 1 we also needed the colors of the sun
Throughout this paper we use the solar absolute mag-
nitudes compiled by Binney  Merrield 1998 M 
548B 483V  442RC and 408I For the trans-
formation of the vdM91 results we needed also the solar
absolute magnitude in the Johnson R-band For this we
used the color transformation RJ  RC 012B RC
007 Davis et al 1985 to obtain M  422RJ5
24 Velocity Dispersions
For the analysis and interpretation of the results it
is important to have access also to other characteristic
quantities for the sample galaxies The velocity disper-
sion is particularly useful because it has been found to
correlate strongly with the galaxy ML C06 To char-
acterize the dispersion we chose the value e inside an
aperture of size equal to the eective radius re  C06
4 This does not necessarily mean that the stellar populations
are indeed on average 10997 yr old and have solar metallicity and
solar abundances ratios But it does mean that such models predict
the correct continuum slope when compared to observations of the
centers of nearby early-type galaxies The models can therefore be
used to estimate the broad-band colors in lter combinations for
which observations are not directly available
5 vdM91 had used M  431RJ so we corrected his results
to M  422RJ before application of equation 1
directly measured this quantity for the galaxies in their
sample from their own data and we adopted their values
for those galaxies For the remainder of the galaxies in
our sample we started from the values nuc given by F89
These are averages of observed values from dierent ob-
servational setups corrected to the size of a few-arcsec
aperture at the distance of Coma From these values
we estimated the dispersion in an aperture of size re 
using the values of re also given by F89 and the cor-
rection formulae given in Jorgensen et al 1995b The
two galaxies NGC 3384 and NGC 7332 did not have data
available from either C06 or F89 and we removed these
galaxies from the sample
The uncertainties in e are probably not dominated
by random uncertainties due to the nite SN of the
spectroscopy but by systematic uncertainties associated
with template mismatch continuum subtraction and
other issues For the high-quality integral eld data of
C06 we followed those authors and estimated the un-
certainties in e  somewhat conservatively to be  5
see also Tremaine et al 2002 This implies  log e 
0021 For those galaxies for which a dispersion estimate
is available also from the F89 data we nd that the resid-
uals  log e  log eF89  log eC06 are on average
consistent with zero h log ei  0007  0008 The
RMS scatter in the residuals is 00316 This is approxi-
mately what would be expected if the e values inferred
from the F89 data also have uncertainties of  5 which
is therefore what we assumed
Table 2 lists the inferred e for all galaxies The table
does not list other galaxy parameters that we will not use
here However we note that various other quantities can
be obtained relatively easily Eective radii are available
from C06 or F89 The latter authors also provide Ie 
the average B-band surface brightness inside the eective
radius The total B-band luminosity can be estimated
from L  2r2
e Ie  or it can be obtained from the ap-
parent B-band magnitudes listed in eg the RC3 de
Vaucouleurs et al 1991 A characteristic mass7 can be
obtained upon multiplication by the ML listed in the
25 Mass-to-Light Ratio Accuracies and Correlations
The random uncertainties on the ML estimates can
be divided broadly in two components distance un-
certainties and dynamical uncertainties The random
distance uncertainties come from the nite accuracy of
the SBF measurements They contribute in quadrature
 logML  02m  M  where m  M  is the
uncertainty in the distance modulus from T01 The dy-
namical uncertainties can come from a large variety of
sources eg shortcomings in the kinematical data or
their spatial coverage or limitations in the modeling or
its underlying assumptions As a result they are gen-
erally poorly quantied We quantify the random dy-
namical uncertainties through a parameter E which for
6 This scatter was obtained by comparing only galaxies with
e  100 km s1 as appropriate for all the galaxies in our sample
for which we actually use the F89 data We did nd larger residuals
of  01 dex for the few galaxies with e  100 km s1
7 The mass M  ML  L is smaller than the total galaxy
mass because it doesnt include all the contribution from a dark
halo However it may contain some contribution from dark matter
K00 C06 so it is probably larger than the total mass in stars

G03 and Cappellari et al 2006a C06 are shown in separate panels All measurements were transformed to the B band and to a
homogeneous set of SBF distances The bottom-right panel contains the combined dataset from Table 2 The solid line the same in each
panel is the best t to this combined data set
simplicity we assume to be a constant for all the mea-
surements in a given dynamical study We then set the
total random uncertainty  logML for a measurement
in a given study equal to the sum of the random distance
uncertainty for the galaxy in question and the value of
E for that study
To estimate the random uncertainty E for each study
we use the fact that the ML correlates with other global
galaxy properties Previous work has shown that there
are good correlations with either luminosity or mass
vdM91 M98 as expected to explain the tilt of the
FP More recently C06 showed that the ML correlates
even better ie with lower scatter with e  This is
the correlation that we will use here For each individual
dynamical study we selected the MLB values for the
galaxies in our nal sample and then tted a straight
line of the form
logMLB  Z  S loge 200 km s1
here Z is short for zeropoint and S is short for slope
We will refer to this as the ML relation The t was
performed with the routine texy of Press et al 1992
which takes into account the uncertainties in both inde-
pendent variables The value of E for each study was
then chosen so as to yield a 2 of the t that is equal to
the number of degrees of freedom This assumes implic-
itly that there is no intrinsic scatter in the correlation
which is conservative in the sense that it yields the largest
possible random uncertainties Application of this pro-
cedure yields E  0116 dex for vdM91 E  0085 dex
for M98 E  0117 dex for K00 E  0128 for G03 and
E  0067 dex for C06 Figure 1 shows the nal B-band
ML values and their random uncertainties as a function
of e for all ve of the individual dynamical studies
To obtain a combined MLB estimate and uncertainty
for each individual galaxy we used a two-step procedure
First we took the weighted average of the MLB val-
ues inferred from the dierent studies of that galaxy us-
ing the uncertainties E listed above to set the weights
Then we increased the uncertainty in the weighted av-
erage by adding in quadrature the random uncertainty
 logML  02m M  introduced by distance un-
certainties Table 2 lists the nal MLB estimates thus
obtained for all galaxies
The bottom right panel of Figure 1 shows the best
straight line t to the nal combined data set
parameters Z  0896  0010 and S  0992  0054
This same line is shown as a solid line in all panels of
Figure 1 The slope of the relation diers signicantly
from the best-t slope SI C06  082  006 found by
C06 for the I-band This is not due to the use of a
dierent galaxy sample
If we perform a linear t to
only the MLB values derived from the C06 study we
infer SC06  0991  0076 consistent with the value
of S inferred for the full sample The dierence in slope
between the I- and B-bands is therefore real and is due
to the well-known fact that galaxies of low dispersion or
mass tend to bluer than those of high dispersion
Figure 1 shows that the dierent studies are all en-
tirely consistent with each other When the data from
each study are tted individually with a straight line
the best t slope is always consistent with the value
S  0992  0054 inferred for the full sample to within
12 or better When the data from each study are tted
individually with a straight line of xed slope S  0992
the inferred zeropoints are ZvdM91  0914  0023
ZM98  0912  0021 ZK00  0897  0029
ZG03  0894  0040 and ZC06  0876  0017
These zeropoints are all consistent with the value Z 
08960010 inferred for the full sample to within 12 or
better The results from the C06 study have the smallest
scatter in Figure 1 as quantied already by the param-
van der Marel  van Dokkum
eter E Judged also from the sophistication and homo-
geneity of their analysis their results are probably the
most reliable of the ve studies that we have included
in our sample On the other hand the color transfor-
mations that we had to apply to transform their I-band
results to the B-band are probably more uncertain than
the transformations that we had to apply to some of the
other studies This may be the root cause of the fact that
the zeropoint for the C06 data is oset from that for the
full sample by 0020 Either way the more important
conclusion in this context is that the zeropoint of the rela-
tion is quite robust8 The use of vastly dierent data and
models among 5 dierent studies does not alter the ze-
ropoint of the relation by more than VI  0020 We
adopt this as the systematic uncertainty in our knowl-
edge of the zeropoint Z from dynamical modeling limi-
tations The robustness of ML estimates from dierent
modeling approaches is consistent with several ndings
reported by C06 For example they nd that the re-
sults of axisymmetric modeling generally do not depend
strongly on the assumed inclination They also nd that
even though two-integral and three-integral models yield
subtly dierent ML estimates there is little bias in the
inferred average ML for a sample that has a typical
range of ML values9
We are now in a position to combine all the various
sources of systematic uncertainty that enter into the ze-
ropoint ZB of equation 2 These are the uncertainties
labeled II III and VI in Table 1 We assume that sys-
tematic uncertainties can be added in quadrature The

31 Intermediate-Redshift Cluster Galaxy Sample
The sample of Paper I consists of 25 galaxies that re-
side in the clusters CL 3C295 CL 00161609 and CL
16014253 at redshifts z  0456 0546 and 0539 re-
spectively Dressler  Gunn 1992 Dressler et al 1999
The clusters were selected based on their visibility at
the time of the Keck observations and because they are
among the most S0 decient clusters in the MORPHS
sample Dressler et al 1997 The latter criterion has
little relevance for the results discussed in the present
paper but was relevant for the discussion of the rotation
properties of the sample galaxies presented in Paper I
The MORPHS sample itself was not selected according
to strict criteria The galaxy selection was largely con-
strained by the geometry of the KeckLRIS masks and
by the fact that sample galaxies should be bright enough
for spectroscopy Priority was given to galaxies classied
from HST images as E or ES0 by Smail et al 1999
The latest-type galaxy included in the sample was an
8 An alternative way to assess dierences in zeropoint between
dierent studies is to analyze the ML values for those galaxies that
have measurements from more than one study We have performed
such an analysis and found zeropoint dierences that are consistent
with those obtained from the ML relation
9 The averages of all the log ML estimates in the C06 sample for
two- and three-integral models respectively agree to within 0003
S0Sb galaxy This galaxy 3C295-568 was included for
the specic purpose to see if rotation could reliably mea-
sured which is indeed the case as demonstrated in Pa-
per I
The galaxy CL 3C295-2014 is the well-known AGN
3C295 There is the possibility that this galaxy contains
a central non-thermal point source that could bias the
analysis However the results for both the light prole of
this galaxy and its ML see Paper I and the discussion
in Section 32 below do not provide any evidence for
deviations from the trends dened by the other galaxies
in the sample We therefore retained CL 3C295-2014 in
our sample and did not treat it in any special way
32 Evolution of the ML relation
Figure 2b shows the ML relation for our sample
of intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies using the data
from Table 1 in Paper I We estimate the systematic un-
certainties in velocity dispersion estimates to be  5
as in Section 24 ie  log e  0021 These uncer-
tainties were added in quadrature to the random uncer-
tainties from Paper I before plotting and analysis For
comparison the left panel of Figure 2a shows the ML
relation for local galaxies as in the bottom right panel
of Figure 1
The solid line in Figure 2b is the line with the xed
slope S  0992 as inferred from the local galaxy sam-
ple that best ts the intermediate redshift cluster galax-
ies It has zeropoint
Z0528  06570022random0049systematic 4
The value hzi  0528 listed in the subscript is the av-
erage redshift of the galaxies The random uncertainty
in the zeropoint was determined as the ratio of the RMS
residual with respect to the t and N  where N  24
is the number of galaxies This does not include the
S0Sb galaxy CL 3C295-568 which was excluded from
the analysis because it is not an early-type galaxy de-
ned here as T  0 By estimating the random zero-
point uncertainty in this way we do not use the random
uncertainties  logML in the individual ML mea-
surements listed in Paper I The average of these uncer-
tainties is actually smaller than the scatter around the
best t 0051 vs 0108 respectively This may be due
to the presence of additional random uncertainties in ad-
dition to those propagated from the observed kinematics
or it may be due to intrinsic scatter in the ML rela-
tion The systematic uncertainty listed in equation 4 is
the quadrature sum of the relevant uncertainties namely
I III IV V and VI in Table 1 This assumes in analogy
with the local sample that the systematic uncertainty
due to modeling limitations is VI  0020 This is
reasonable because the two-integral modeling that we
have used for the intermediate-redshift cluster sample
was very similar to that used by vdM91 and M98 for
local galaxies and more generally C06 found that two-
integral models do not yield strongly biased ML esti-
mates as compared to more sophisticated three-integral
models
The evolution of the ML between the two redshifts
is obtained by subtracting the zeropoints of the ML
relations given by equations 3 and 4 This yields

cluster redshifts are labeled on the plot The dotted line is the best-t for local galaxies as also shown in the left panel The solid line has
the same slope but was shifted to best t the intermediate redshift cluster galaxies This shift quanties the ML evolution with redshift
The open symbol denotes the S0Sb galaxy CL 3C295-568 which was excluded from the analysis of ML evolution because it is not an
early-type galaxy dened here as T  0
where in this particular case the average redshifts for the
distant and local samples are hzi  0528 and 0005 re-
spectively The random uncertainty in  logML is sim-
ply the quadrature sum of the random uncertainties in
Z0528 and Z0005 However the systematic uncertainty
is not the quadrature sum of the systematic uncertain-
ties in those quantities That is because source III of
systematic uncertainty in Table 1 is common to both ze-
ropoints and therefore drops out of their dierence So
the systematic uncertainty listed in equation 5 is the
quadrature sum of the uncertainties I II IV V and VI
in Table 1 We include source VI only once because it
was dened as a measure of the typical dierence in the
results from dierent dynamical modeling approaches
As discussed in Paper I the only parameter in our
models that is not generally constrained by the data is
the inclination or alternatively the intrinsic axial ratio
Q Equation 5 was derived from the results obtained
in Paper I for our standard inclination models These
models use for each galaxy the most likely inclination
given the observed projected axial ratio These mod-
els have the correct average intrinsic axial ratio when
averaged over a large sample For comparison we have
also constructed two sets of alternative models namely
models that are edge-on yielding the roundest possible
intrinsic shape for each galaxy and models that have
intrinsic axial Qmin  04 which is approximately the
smallest intrinsic axial ratio found for early-type galax-
ies The former yield an average  logML for the
sample that is lower by 0008 than for the standard in-
clination models The latter yield a value that is higher
by 0053 The assumptions that underly these models are
clearly unrealistic for the sample as a whole and either
way do not change the result in equation 5 by much
more than the listed uncertainties Nonetheless these
numbers give some idea of the systematic uncertainty
in the ML estimates for individual galaxies due to the
unknown inclinations In other words variations in in-
clination between galaxies of the same projected axial
ratio do not aect the average correlation in Figure 2b
but they do add to the scatter However the induced
scatter is too small to account for the observed scatter
of 0108 in logML
The change of ML with redshift is  logMLz

So far we have treated all intermediate redshift cluster
galaxies as a single sample
It is of course also possi-
ble to calculate the zeropoint evolution for each clus-
ter individually This yields  logML CL 3C295 
0180  0065 random  logML CL 16014253
 0259  0035 random and  logML CL
00161609  0241  0024 random These values
each have the same systematic uncertainty as listed for
the combined sample in equation 5 The cluster CL
3C295 has the smallest amount of evolution as expected
given its lower redshift However the dierences between
the clusters are not really signicant given the random
uncertainties The clusters span a range z  0045
see Section 31 which implies an expected variation
 logML  002 on the basis of equation 6 This
is smaller than the average random error of 0051 in our
logML measurements and it is also smaller than the
scatter of 0108 around the linear t in Figure 2b Cor-
rection for dierential evolution between galaxies in our
sample at slightly dierent redshifts would therefore not
change any of the results So it is justied to treat
the galaxies as a single sample at an average redshift
hzi  0528 This approach has the advantage that it
doesnt introduce any prior knowledge about evolution
into the analysis of the sample

This result uses only the same subset of N  17 galax-
ies that were included in the FP analysis in vDvdM06
we discuss this selection further in Section 4 below It
treats all the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies as a
single sample for consistency with Section 32 The av-
erage redshift of this sample is hzi  0531 The random
uncertainty in  logML is 1083 times the quadra-
ture sum of the random uncertainties in the FP zero-
points for Coma 0011 and the intermediate-redshift
cluster galaxy sample 0023 For Coma we used the
data for galaxies that have B-band photometry listed in
Jorgensen et al 1995a and velocity dispersions listed
in Jorgensen et al 1995b For each sample the random
uncertainty was estimated as before as the ratio of the
RMS residual with respect to the t and N 
The systematic uncertainty in equation 9 is due to
a combination of the systematic uncertainties that aect
coma and distant We summarize these uncertainties in
Table 3 Sources that were already encountered previ-
ously are listed with the same roman numeral as in Ta-
ble 1 Consider rst the Coma FP zeropoint coma Dis-
tance uncertainties aect log re  and therefore the zero-
point of the FP relation Distances in turn are estimated
as the ratio of the Hubble ow velocity vow and the Hub-
ble constant H0 Uncertainties in both of these introduce
FP zeropoint uncertainties We have used in our analysis
one of the most recent ow velocity estimates for Coma
namely vow  7376  223 km s1 from the SMAC sur-
vey Smith Lucey  Hudson 2006 This is consistent
with several earlier results For example F89 obtained
vow  7461  273 km s1 and Colless et al 2001 ob-
tained vow  7238  302 km s1 The uncertainties in
all these results are dominated by the modeling uncer-
tainty in the peculiar velocity vpec  vobs  vow of the
Coma cluster where vobs is the observed systematic ve-
locity The uncertainty in vow introduces an uncertainty
of VII  0013 in  The determination of the Hubble
ow velocity also has a small dependence on the cosmo-
logical parameters m  However at the distance of
Coma this dependence is small enough that the result-
ing uncertainties can be neglected Uncertainties in H0
include the uncertainties III and V in Table 1 which in-
troduce FP zeropoint uncertainties III  0037 and
III  0023 The last systematic uncertainty that af-
fects coma stems from the fact that dierent authors get
slightly dierent zeropoints even if they assume exactly
the same distance Based on our own analysis of various
literature sources as well as the detailed analysis of Hud-
son et al 2001 we estimate this systematic zeropoint
uncertainty to be VIII  0020 Addition in quadra-
ture of the uncertainties III V VII and VIII yields a
nal systematic uncertainty in coma of 0050 The
FP zeropoint distant of the intermediate-redshift cluster
galaxy sample shares the systematic uncertainties III V
and VIII with Coma It also is subject to uncertainty I
in Table 1 that results from uncertainties in m and 
and uncertainty IV that results from cosmic variance in
H0 Addition in quadrature yields a nal systematic un-
certainty in distant of 0049 To study ML evolution
we are now interested in the dierence coma  distant
The uncertainties III IV and V in Table 3 drop out of
this dierence However the dierence is subject to un-
certainties I VII and VIII We include source VIII only
once because it was dened as a measure of the typical
dierence in zeropoint between dierent authors There
is also a new uncertainty due to cosmic variance in H0
that is similar to source IV However the relevant scale
is now the distance of the Coma cluster z  0025 and
not the scales z  01 over which Type Ia supernovae
have been used to calibrate H0 Based on the discus-
sion in Section 86 of Freedman et al 2001 we estimate
this systematic component to be less than 4 This cor-
responds to a FP zeropoint dierence IX  0018
Addition in quadrature yields a nal systematic uncer-
tainty in coma  distant of 0030 Division by 083
yields the systematic uncertainty in  logML listed in

might be a slight overestimate because it ignores possi-
ble correlations between the residuals from both meth-
ods The listed systematic uncertainty is the quadrature
sum of all those uncertainties that do not drop out of
the dierence under consideration This includes the sys-
tematic uncertainties II V and VI in Table 1 and VII
and VIII in Table 3 There also is a systematic uncer-
tainty due to the cosmic variance in H0 when measured
on scales of z  0025 and z  01 respectively Based on
the discussion in Section 86 of Freedman et al 2001 we
estimate this uncertainty to be  logML  0009
The upshot of equation 11 is that the ML evolution
derived here from detailed dynamical models is consis-
tent with that derived from FP analysis of global param-
eters The present paper therefore supports the conclu-
sions drawn in vDvdM06 and summarized in Section 1
of the present paper about the star formation epoch of
early type galaxies
4 DEPENDENCE OF ML EVOLUTION ON 
Figure 3 shows the residuals with respect to the ML
 relation ie with respect to the solid line in Figure 2b
for the sample of intermediate redshift cluster galaxies
The logML residuals do not show a signicant corre-
lation with log e  For example the average residual for
galaxies with e  200 km s1 is 0010  0039 while
the average residual for galaxies with e  200 km s1
is 0008  0024 These values are consistent at the 1-
 level This implies that the analysis yields the same
evolution  logML eq 5 independent of whether or
not galaxies with low  are excluded from the statistics
Phrased dierently there is no evidence for evolution of
the slope of the ML relation out to z  05 This can
also be shown explicitly A straight line t to the data
in Figure 2b yields slope S  1117 0113 as compared
to S  0992  0054 for the sample of local galaxies in
Figure 2a Again these values are consistent at the 1-
The relative constancy of the slope of the ML re-
lation is consistent with some studies of FP evolution
For example Kelson et al 2000 nd no statistically
signicant change in the tilt of the FP between the lo-
cal Universe and a cluster at z  033 However many
Fig 3 logML residuals with respect to the solid line in
Figure 2b There is no signicant correlation with log e  So there
is no evidence for evolution of the slope of the ML relation out
to z  05 Each datapoint is an individual galaxy in the sample
of intermediate redshift cluster galaxies with point types the same
as in Figure 2
other FP studies mostly towards higher redshifts have
recently found that the FP tilt does evolve eg Wuyts
et al 2004 Treu et al 2005ab van der Wel et al 2004
2005 di Serego Alighieri et al 2005 and Jorgensen et
al 2006 In fact we showed in vDvdM06 that the FP
residuals for the same sample analyzed here show more
evolution for galaxies with   200 km s1 or similarly
M  1011 M than for galaxies with   200 km s1
or similarly M  1011 M Based on these results
the FP analysis in vDvdM06 was restricted to galaxies
with M  1011 M The same selection was applied in
the derivation of equation 10 With this FP selection
criterion the inferred ML evolution agrees with that
derived from the dynamical models presented here as
quantied by eq 11 However without this FP selec-
tion criterion the agreement is worse
This issue is further illustrated in Figure 4 It shows
for each galaxy the dierence between the evolution in
logML inferred either from the dynamically inferred
ML relation or from the FP The dierences are plot-
ted as a function of log e  There is a clear trend
with e  The results from the two methods agree
only when the comparison is restricted to galaxies with
  200 km s1 or similarly M  1011 M It is shown
by equation 11 that the dierence between the two
methods might be aected by various systematic uncer-
tainties However these uncertainties are mostly related
to uncertainties in distance scales They cannot intro-
duce a dependence on log e  Therefore the trend in
Figure 4 must have a dierent origin We continue in
the following subsections by exploring various possible
explanations This is an important issue because dier-
ences in ML evolution between low-mass and high-mass
galaxies are generally interpreted as due to dierences in
stellar population age Such age dierences have a direct
bearing on our understanding of galaxy formation
van der Marel  van Dokkum
4 Dierence between the evolution in logML as
calculated either from dynamical models and the ML rela-
tion or from the FP The inferred evolution agrees for dispersions
e  200km s1 ie log e  230 or similarly M  1011 M
However at lower dispersions the FP suggests more evolution than
do the dynamical ML measurements Each datapoint is an indi-
vidual galaxy in the sample of intermediate redshift cluster galax-
ies with point types the same as in Figure 2
41 Structure Evolution
If galaxies do not change their structure over time then
any evolution in either the FP or the ML relation
must be due to ML evolution
In this case a study
of the evolution of these two relations always implies the
same correct ML evolution However this equivalence
ceases to exist when the structure of galaxies evolves with
As a simple illustration of the possible impact of struc-
ture evolution consider the example in which some pro-
cess changes the re of a galaxy while ML and e re-
main constant This will obviously not move the galaxy
with respect to the ML relation However the galaxy
will move with respect to the FP The virial theorem dic-
tates that
MLvir  K2
e 2Gre Ie 
where G is the gravitational constant and K the struc-
ture constant a scalar that depends on the structure of
the galaxy for example a spherical model with a de Vau-
couleurs R14 surface brightness prole has K  595
If we assume in this example that the galaxy changes
its structure homologously then K will remain constant
Equation 12 then implies that  log Ie   log re 
Therefore at its new re the galaxy will be oset from
the FP by an amount   017 log re  The custom-
ary assumptions for interpreting FP evolution see eg
eq 9 would then incorrectly suggest a mass-to-light
ratio evolution of  logML  020 log re 
It is equally possible to construct examples in which
FP evolution properly measures ML evolution whereas
ML evolution does not To illustrate this consider
the situation in which due to some process a galaxy
homologously changes its re  e and Ie while ML
remains constant
If  log re  271 log e and
 log Ie  471 log e  then the galaxy will continue
to fall on the edge-on projection of the FP The cus-
tomary assumptions for interpreting FP evolution would
Fig 5 Dierence between the evolution in logML as cal-
culated either from the virial theorem and the ML relation
or from the FP The two methods do not yield the same results
despite the fact that both analyses are based on exactly the same
global properties e  re  and Ie  and use exactly the same local
comparison sample Coma There is a trend with e in the same
direction as in Figure 4 Each datapoint is an individual galaxy
in the sample of intermediate redshift cluster galaxies with point
types the same as in Figure 2
then correctly suggest that there was no change in ML
However the galaxy will now be oset from the ML
relation by an amount  logML  037 log re 
These examples show that whenever there is evolu-
tion in any of the structural quantities e  re  e 
Ie ML or K then the ML evolution inferred from
the FP and from the ML relation will not generally
agree with each other One plausible explanation for
the trend in Figure 4 is therefore that galaxies undergo
structural evolution with time and that this evolution is
dierent for galaxies of low and high e 
The assessment of the importance of this eect is com-
plicated by the fact that our analysis of the evolution of
the ML evolution has been based on rather dierent
data than our analysis of the FP evolution The former
used spatially resolved brightness proles and kinemat-
ics whereas the latter used only the characteristic quan-
tities re  Ie  and e  A somewhat cleaner comparison
can therefore be made through an analysis of ML
evolution based on virial estimates from equation 12
which uses the same three characteristic quantities as
FP studies To this end we rst calculated the values of
MLvir for the sample of Coma galaxies studied by Jor-
gensen et al 1995ab The values thus obtained were
t by a straight line of the form given by equation 2
which yields parameters Zcoma  log K  0163  0015
and Scoma  0887 0095 We then calculated MLvir
for all of the intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies The
evolution for each galaxy was calculated by comparison
to the MLvir relation for Coma
Figure 5 shows for each galaxy the dierence between
the evolution thus determined and the evolution deter-
mined from the FP evolution By contrast to Figure 4
both measures of evolution are now inferred entirely from
the same global properties e  re  and Ie  and use
exactly the same local comparison sample However
there is a still a trend in the inferred ML evolution
with e  in the same sense as in Figure 4 This sup-
Dynamical Models of Elliptical Galaxies in z  05 clusters II
removed from the comparison The dierences thus cal-
culated which are equal to the the dierences between
the residuals shown in Figures 4 and 5 are shown as a
function of the rotation parameter k There is a signi-
cant trend for the residuals to be larger for galaxies that
have more rotational support For example the quantity
 logMLdyn   logMLvir has an average value of
0095 0011 for galaxies with k  06 and 0138 0026
for galaxies with k  06 By contrast we have found no
correlation with the observed axial ratio of each galaxy
The dynamical models that we have used here explic-
itly account for the observed rotation of each galaxy
whereas studies based entirely on e do not This
causes MLvir or the FP to systematically underes-
timate the ML of rapidly rotating galaxies It is not
immediately obvious though that the inferred ML evo-
lution would be impacted by this Studies of FP evolu-
tion or MLvir evolution ignore rotation both in the
local Universe and at intermediate redshift so any bias
might cancel out when dierent redshifts are compared
On the other hand observations in the local universe
generally use small apertures that cover only the cen-
tral part of the galaxy whereas observations of distant
galaxies generally use apertures that cover most of the
galaxy To enable meaningful comparison observations
at dierent redshifts are generally transformed to a com-
mon aperture size using transformations that themselves
do not explicitly account for rotation eg Jorgensen et
al 1995b Therefore observations at dierent redshifts
may be impacted by rotation in dierent manner So
any bias introduced through the neglect of rotation in
FP or MLvir calculations may not cancel out when
samples at dierent redshifts are compared This may
bias the inferred evolution and could therefore aect the
trend in Figure 6 The fact that the trend in Figure 4 is
steeper than that in Figure 5 is related to the fact that
galaxies of low e tend to have more rotational support
than those of high e both in the local universe and in
the sample of intermediate-redshift cluster galaxies see
Paper I
Figure 6 shows that even at k  0 there is a dierence
of  005 dex between the evolution inferred from the
dynamical and virial ML estimates The signicance
of this oset is low given the systematic error quoted in
equation 11 The oset could be due to a combination
of several dierent eects For example a system-
atic uncertainties in the relative distance scale between
our local comparison sample of Section 2 and Coma b
systematic errors in the conversions of observed velocity
dispersions in some xed aperture to e  or c redshift
evolution of the structure constant K
On a separate note we do not nd a correlation be-
tween the residuals from the ML relation inferred
from our dynamical models ie the oset of the points
in Figure 2b from the solid straight line in that gure
and either the rotation parameter k or the morphological
types from Smail et al 1997 This is shown in Figure 7
We discussed in Paper I that some of the most rapidly
rotating galaxies in the sample could be misclassied S0
galaxies Such galaxies or other galaxies of intermediate
and late Hubble types might have recently transformed
from star-forming eld galaxies If so one would expect
their ML ratios to be smaller than for the true ellip-
tical galaxies which may have formed the bulk of their
Fig 6 Dierence between the evolution in logML as cal-
culated from the ML relation using either dynamical models
or the virial theorem The dierence is shown as a function of
the rotation rate k determined in Paper I For rapidly rotating
galaxies the ML evolution inferred from the dynamical models is
less than that implied by the virial estimates Each datapoint is
an individual galaxy in the sample of intermediate redshift cluster
galaxies with point types the same as in Figure 2 Only those 15
galaxies are shown for which the rotation rate k could be reliably
determined
ports the view that structural quantities in addition to
ML are probably evolving with time Note that it is
not possible to identify whether a more accurate esti-
mate of ML evolution is obtained by studying FP evo-
lution or ML evolution For this one would need to
know exactly how the structural properties of individual
elliptical galaxies change with redshift which is not well
constrained observationally
42 Rotation
The trend in Figure 5 is not as steep as that in Fig-
ure 4 This means that part of the trend in Figure 4 must
be due to dierences in evolution between our ML val-
ues from dynamical modeling and the MLvir values
determined from the virial theorem Such dierences are
not necessarily unexpected given that our models ought
to be more accurate They account for rotation and ho-
mological dierences between galaxies and as a function
of redshift whereas the virial analysis does not
In Paper I we determined for each galaxy the normal-
ized rotation measure k which is similar to the quantity
v that is often used for local galaxies For k  0
the galaxy is non-rotating whereas for k  1 the ve-
locity dispersion tensor is isotropic and the galaxy is
a so-called oblate isotropic rotator The quantity k
is reasonably well determined for the 15 galaxies in the
sample for which a slit was placed within 45 of the ma-
jor axis and which have projected ellipticity   010
these galaxies are marked with an asterisk in Table 1
of Paper I Figure 6 shows for these 15 galaxies the dif-
ferences between the following two quantities a the
evolution inferred from our dynamical models and the
local comparison sample described in Section 2 and b
the evolution inferred from the MLvir estimates us-
ing Coma as comparison sample Since both measures of
evolution are based on an underlying relation between
ML and  any eects introduced by structure evo-
lution such as those described in Section 41 are now

might have supported the view that more rapidly rotating or later-type galaxies formed the bulk of their stars more recently
stars longer ago Figure 7 shows no obvious trends that
would support this view However a sample with a larger
number of S0 and later-type galaxies would obviously be
more suited to address this issue
43 Other Systematic Eects
The slope of the ML relation does not change with
redshift for our sample despite the fact that the FP tilt
does evolve with redshift We have shown that this can
be plausibly attributed to a combination of two eects
a evolution in structural properties and b the ne-
glect of rotational support in studies of FP evolution
Nonetheless there are other systematic eects that may
inuence the comparison In particular it is worth con-
sidering potential systematic errors in the evolution in-
ferred from our dynamical modeling approach We dis-
cuss two possible eects but conclude in the end that
neither is likely to be a signicant contributor to the
trend seen in Figure 4
431 Environment
It is possible that ML depends not only on e  but
also on environment Our sample of intermediate redshift
galaxies consists of galaxies in rich cluster environments
To study ML evolution one compares to local galax-
ies which generally reside in somewhat dierent environ-
ments So any local dependence of ML on environment
would bias the inferred ML evolution If this is in fact
an issue then it is more likely to aect the evolution
inferred from dynamical models and the ML rela-
tion than it is to aect FP studies The latter generally
use Coma as a local comparison sample While Coma
is not as rich as clusters studied at higher redshift it
is nonetheless a dense cluster environment By contrast
the local comparison sample used to construct the ML
 relation Table 2 contains an inhomogeneous mixture
of galaxies in cluster group and eld environments It
has been suggested that eld galaxies might typically be
younger and thus have lower ML values than cluster
galaxies eg Diaferio et al 2001 Bernardi et al 2003
Annibali et al 2006 If this were true and in particular
for galaxies of low  or mass then this might explain
part of the trend seen in Figure 4 However there is lit-
tle evidence that any dependence on environment would
in fact be larger for galaxies of low  or mass Clemens
et al 2006 Also a signicant fraction 2560 of the
galaxies in our local comparison sample Table 2 come
from the work of C06 They explicitly studied the resid-
uals of the ML relation as a function of environment
and did not nd any dependence
To test directly for environmental eects we compared
the ML relation for our local comparison sample to
the MLvir relation for Coma The zeropoint Zcoma
and slope Scoma of the latter relation are listed in Sec-
tion 41 The value of Scoma is consistent at the  1
level with the slope S  0992  0054 inferred for our
local comparison sample Also the value of Zcoma is
consistent with the value Z  0896  0010 for the local
comparison sample if K  540 023 This value can be
compared to the average K  509 019 for the galaxies
in our local comparison sample which can be determined
directly by equating the dynamical ML to MLvir for
these galaxies These two estimates of K are entirely
consistent especially when taking into account the pre-
viously discussed systematic uncertainties in the relative
distance scales between our local comparison sample and
the Coma cluster For comparison C06 found that for
data in the I-band K  48  01 In addition to being
a useful consistency check these results show that there
is no evidence for a strong environmental dependence of
the ML relation in the local universe The trend in
Figure 4 therefore cannot be attributed to environmental
inuences on the analysis
432 Spatial Resolution
FP and dynamical modeling analyses rely in dierent
manner on knowledge of the galaxy surface brightness
prole To calculate the FP position of a galaxy one
needs to know only the integrated luminosity within the
eective radius By contrast to perform the dynamical
modeling one needs to model the surface brightness pro-
le down to very small radii which requires accurate PSF
deconvolution Any systematic errors introduced by this
are likely to produce a relative dierence between ML
Dynamical Models of Elliptical Galaxies in z  05 clusters II
evolution inferred from FP analysis and dynamical mod-
eling This is likely to aect low-mass galaxies which
are smaller on average more than high-mass galaxies
So potential PSF deconvolution errors in our dynamical
modeling could in principle produce a trend such as that
in Figure 4 While this issue may be a contributing factor
to the results in Figure 4 we do not believe that it can
be the full explanation The galaxies in our sample that
provide evidence for evolution in the FP tilt have re in
the range 016080 see g 5a of vDvdM06 Most of
these galaxies are quite well resolved even with the 01
pixels of the HSTWFPC2 Nonetheless future higher
resolution imaging such as now possible with the HST
Advanced Camera for Surveys ACS would certainly
decrease any sensitivity of the dynamical modeling on
PSF deconvolution
Even if limited spatial resolution were an issue for our
models it would not explain the entire trend in Figure 4
After all a shallower trend is seen even in Figure 12
which does not involve any dynamical modeling at all
The hypothesis of errors due to limited spatial resolution
could at best explain the trend in Figure 6 Galaxies with
more rotational support tend to have lower mass see
Paper I therefore tend to be smaller on average and
therefore could in principle be more aected by spatial
resolution issues
5 SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Many studies in the past decade have addressed the
ML evolution of early-type galaxies using the FP This
uses only global photometric and kinematic quantities
and is therefore relatively straightforward to explore
However FP evolution equals ML evolution only if
many simplifying assumptions are met as discussed in
Section 1 The validity of these assumptions has re-
mained poorly veried
It is therefore important to
address ML evolution more directly by using dynam-
ical models for spatially resolved photometric and kine-
matic data
In Paper I we constructed two-integral
f E Lz models for 25 visually-classied early type and
in most cases elliptical galaxies in the intermediate-
redshift z  05 clusters CL3C295 CL001616 and
CL160142 Fitting of the models to surface photome-
try from HST and kinematics from KeckLRIS yielded
for each galaxy the average rest-frame B-band ML in-
side the spectroscopically explored region The results
allow a critical test of many of the assumptions that have
underlied previous studies of FP evolution
To study redshift evolution we needed a suitable com-
parison sample of ML values for local early-type galax-
ies We therefore compiled a sample of 60 galaxies in
the local Universe for which detailed dynamical mod-
els were previously constructed to t spatially resolved
kinematical data Attention was restricted to galaxies in
ve specic modeling studies that addressed large sam-
ples All inferred ML values were brought to a ho-
mogeneous distance scale using distances obtained with
the SBF method Galaxies without SBF distances were
excluded from the sample All ML values were trans-
formed to the B band using either measured or esti-
mated broad-band colors C06 found that ML cor-
relates tightly with velocity dispersion
logML 
Z  S loge 200 km s1 where e is the velocity
dispersion inside an aperture of size equal to the eec-
tive radius re  This rened previous work which had
found that ML correlates more loosely with galaxy
luminosity or mass We conrm the nding of C06 Our
larger homogenized sample gives Z  0896  0010
and S  0992  0054 We estimate the systematic
uncertainty in Z due to modeling uncertainties to be
Z  002 based on a comparison of ML results ob-
tained from dierent dynamical modeling studies The
slope that we derive for the B band diers from the best-
t slope S  082  006 found by C06 for the I band
This is due to the well-known fact that galaxies of low
dispersion or mass tend to be bluer than those of high
dispersion
The ML values inferred for the intermediate-redshift
cluster sample follow a similar relation with e as
found for the local galaxies However the zeropoint
Z  0657  0022 is smaller than for the local sam-
ple The measured change of zeropoint with redshift im-
plies that  logMLz  0457 0046 random
0078 systematic A comparison of the FP dened by
the high-mass galaxies with M  1011 M in the same
sample with that measured for the nearby Coma clus-
ter yields  logMLz  0529 0049 random 
0071 systematic The systematic uncertainties in these
results are dominated by a variety of issues that aect
our knowledge of the relative distance scale between local
and distant galaxies Although these systematic uncer-
tainties are often not explicitly addressed we stress that
they are present in all studies of ML evolution that
use either dynamical models or the FP The results from
both methods are consistent with passive evolution of
high-mass galaxies following formation at high redshift
as quantied in vDvdM06
Comparison of the ML evolution inferred from our
dynamical modeling study and from the FP yields excel-
lent agreement for massive galaxies This is an impor-
tant a posteriori verication of the assumptions that have
underlied all previous FP evolution studies
It shows
that to lowest order FP evolution does indeed measure
ML evolution as suggested also by the results of Treu
 Koopmans 2004 for lensing galaxies It also shows
that the subset of hierarchical structure formation mod-
els in which FP zeropoint evolution does not track ML
evolution eg Almeida et al 2006 is inconsistent with
our observational understanding of early-type galaxies
Our results provide no evidence that the galaxies in the
sample with the latest Hubble types ie ES0 S0E
S0 or S0Sb or the galaxies with the highest rotation
rates tend to have lower ML values This might have
been expected if such galaxies transformed recently from
star-forming eld galaxies
While there is broad agreement between the dynamical
modeling and the FP results we nd important dier-
ences in the behavior of ML evolution as a function of
e or similarly mass For the dynamically inferred
ML relation we nd no evidence for a change of the
slope with redshift and therefore no dependence of ML
evolution on e  By contrast our own work for this
same sample and that of many previous authors on other
samples has found that the FP tilt does evolve with red-
shift We studied this dierence by analyzing the resid-
uals with respect to the tted relations and by consid-
ering also the evolution implied by MLvir estimates
from the virial theorem Based on this we nd that the
van der Marel  van Dokkum
dierence between the results from FP evolution and dy-
namically determined ML evolution can be plausibly
attributed to a combination of two eects a evolution
in structural properties and b the neglect of rotational
support in studies of FP evolution We investigated other
potential explanations as well including the possibility
that our results may be biased due to unaccounted local
dependencies of ML on environment or the possibil-
ity that systematic errors may aect our results for the
smallest galaxies due to the nite spatial resolution of
the HST imaging data However we argue that neither
of these latter issues signicantly aects our analysis
Both FP evolution and evolution of the ML re-
lation constrain the ML evolution of elliptical galaxies
However these approaches need not give the same answer
or more generally the correct answer if the structure
of galaxies evolves with time We nd some evidence for
this from the fact that the results from FP evolution and
MLvir evolution dier in the sense that there is a
slight trend with e  even when the analysis is in both
cases based on exactly the same global properties e 
re  and Ie  and uses exactly the same local compar-
ison sample Coma
In general neither FP evolution
nor evolution of the ML relation can uniquely and
correctly determine the amount of ML evolution un-
less one knows or correctly assumes how the structural
properties of the galaxies change with time This is is
not very well constrained observationally and one there-
fore has to rely on assumptions and theoretical insights
Translation of ML evolution into ML evolution as-
sumes only that the e of galaxies does not change over
time By contrast translation of FP evolution into ML
evolution assumes that none of the quantities e  re 
e  Ie ML or the structure constant K change
over time Although elliptical galaxies are collisionless
systems all these structural quantities can in fact change
through mergers However the inferred ML evolution
is in practice used primarily to estimate the mean age of
the stars under the assumption that only the luminosity
is evolving eg vDvdM06 This relaxes the underlying
assumptions in the sense that the correct age is obtained
but not the correct ML evolution as long as any evo-
lution of structural parameters moves galaxies only along
the ML relation or along the edge-on projection of
the FP Models have suggested that structural changes
induced by mergers do indeed approximately have this
property Gonzalez-Garcia  van Albada 2003 Boylan-
Kolchin Ma  Quataert 2006 Robertson et al 2006
An approach that is based on dynamical models has
less built-in assumptions than approaches such as those
using the FP or MLvir values that are based entirely
on global or characteristic quantities In particular the
ML values that we determined in Paper I account for
several known non-homologies between galaxies such as
dierences in axial ratio brightness prole rotational
support and internal velocity distribution Moreover
kinematical proles as a function of radius were calcu-
lated and tted instead of just a single characteristic
dispersion We found that the dierence in the ML
evolution inferred from either dynamical models or the
virial theorem correlates with the galaxy rotation rate
k This suggests that the omission of rotation in studies
of FP evolution may be an important oversimplication
Nonetheless it is important to stress that many caveats
remain even with the dynamical modeling approach ex-
plored here For example if the triaxiality or velocity
dispersion anisotropy of early-type galaxies evolves with
redshift then this might bias the results of our dynami-
cal models as it would for FP studies Also both FP
studies and the present work may suer from progen-
itor bias This is the bias introduced by the fact that
some of todays early-type galaxies may not be identied
as early-type galaxies in samples at higher redshifts see
vDvdM06 for a discussion of the size of this bias
In vDvdM06 we reported a steeping of the FP tilt with
redshift for our sample galaxies This is generally inter-
preted to mean that low-mass galaxies have undergone
more ML evolution than high-mass galaxies and are
therefore younger However the results presented here
show that this conclusion need not necessarily be cor-
rect the dynamical models provide little evidence for a
dierence in ML evolution between low-mass and high-
mass galaxies and the steepening of the FP tilt may
be aected by other issues than ML evolution This
does not rule out the possibility that low-mass galaxies
have younger population ages than high-mass galaxies
But it does mean than one should be careful in draw-
ing conclusions of this nature entirely on the basis of FP
In general it is important to test for dierences
in population age also on the basis of other considera-
tions For example van der Wel et al 2005 and Treu
et al 2005b considered broad-band colors and spectro-
scopic diagnostics in combination with FP residuals to
argue for age dierences between eld galaxies of dier-
ent mass Their results are not necessarily inconsistent
with those presented here because the situation may be
dierent for galaxies in the eld and in clusters and it
may be dierent at dierent redshifts
Our work shows that dynamical modeling of large sam-
ples of galaxies at intermediate redshifts provides a pow-
erful new method for the study of galaxy evolution It
therefore seems useful to expand the present work to
other samples that explore a wider range of redshifts
environments and galaxy types
