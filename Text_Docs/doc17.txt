Abstract
OLAC   was  founded   in   2000   for   creating 
online   databases   of   language   resources   This 
paper intends to review the bottom-up distributed 
character of the project and proposes an extension 
of   the   architecture   for   Dravidian   languages   An 
ontological   structure   is   considered   for   effective 
natural   language   processing   NLP   and   its 
advantages over statistical methods are reviewed
equivalent   to   the   set   of   predicates   that   are 
significantly predicable of y 
The   agreement   to   this   idea   makes   the   phonetic 
languages  
languages   more 
computationally analyzable languages 
like   Dravidian  
The knowledge- based approaches in the ordinary 
natural
language   processing   NLP   using 
quantitative say statistical corpus-based or machine 
learning tools are not fully fool proof

Introduction
Though   the   compilation   of   morphological   and 
phonological rules are effectively done using finite-
state   acceptors   and   transducers   Mehryar   Mohri 
Fernando   Pereira   Michael   Riley   1996   when   it 
comes to Dravidian languages a semantic counter 
revolution is very much needed and it should be 
based on an ontological structure that also considers 
the   common   sense   view   of   human   brain   It   has 
already been shown that W S Saba 2008 this is 
true in the case with non phonetic languages like 
English 
In   this   paper   the   author   tries   to   provide   a 
technically   feasible   methodology   for  
preservation of Dravidian Languages based on an 
OLAC   Extension   and   a   semantic  ontological 
structure Further using variables and quantification 
we can improvise the whole concept of Ontology 
Fred Sommers 1963 suggested the idea of strongly 
typed ontology that is quite evident in the spoken 
language where two objects x and y are considered 
to   be   of   the   same   type   iff   the   set   of   monadic 
predicates that are significantly that is truly or 
falsely but not absurdly predicable of x is

The preservation and nourishing of the language 
is viable only if the mode of accessing is akin to 
the one illustrated in the figure Fig 1 Steven 
BirdGary Simons  and Chu-Ren Huang 2001
The Open Language Archives Community OLAC 
was   formulated   to   have   a   federated   language 
archives based on the Open Archives Initiative and 
the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative 
The project is mostly pivoted around the goal that 
enables researchers and linguists to document their 
resources   tools   and   data   In   order   to   avoid   the 
complexities   in   finding  the   right   information   the 
project   employed   the   OAI  Shared   Metadata   Set 
Dublin   Core   which   facilitated   interoperability 
across all repositories that are involved in the OAI 
and the OAI Metadata Harvesting Protocol which 
helps the user to query a repository using HTTP 
requests Though OAI archives have a submission 
procedure   a   long-term   storage   system   and   a 
retrieval   mechanism   it   is   not   effective   for 
preserving the classical documents which are very 
vital   when   it   comes   to   Dravidian   languages   like 
Sanskrit So is the case with the folklore languages 
that are strongly connected to this
Even   though   the   project   follows   a   bottom-up 
distributed character of the web it id quite effective 
since   it   has   a  structured   nature   of   a   centralized 
database   What   interests   more   to   the   Dravidian 
language linguists is that  it can support metadata 
standards in addition to the Dublin Core The user 
using   Ethnologue   database   has   also   access   to 
specific   information   for   each   language   viz  a 
unique   three-letter   code   the   country   where   this 
language   is   spoken   alternative   names   dialects

Though   language   identification   and   supporting 
multilingual resources are few hurdles in the way 
OLAC still stands out as a potential candidate for 
language preservation and promotion 
We   can   find   that   the   MT   Machine   Translation 
system   is   a   unidirectional   system   which   has   the 
ability to translate language A to language B And 
for   handling   the   bidirectional   situation   where   a 
system   translates   in   both   directions   between   the 
languages   say   between   X   and   Y   as   illustrated 
below 
pairSubjectlanguage code X
Language code Ypair

Language code Xpair
And a fully bidirectional lexicon specified for the 
users of either language would be described in the 
same way as a bidirectional MT system as shown

3 Analysis and Suggestions
The   disappointments   with   purely   engineering 
methodologies   were   discussed   briefly   in   the 
introduction   And   these   eventually   led   to   the 
construction of very large knowledge bases for NLP 
Lenat   and   Ghua   1990   Thus   with   a   sound 
linguistic   and   ontological   underpinnings   a   good 
extension of OLAC can be done for the preservation 
and promotion of Dravidian languages 
The root cause for the development is that most of 
the documents still exist in manuscript format And 
when   it   comes   to   languages   like   Sanskrit   the 
resources are mostly in copylefted state NLP can 
help in converting this to digitally readable format 
and   using   MT   technique   the   languages   can   be 
popularised These two points are elucidated further 
in the rest of this paper 
The whole scenario is practical since we are in a 
Platonic   universe   which   admits   the   existence   of 
anything that we can discuss using our language 
Cocchiarella 1996 went one more step ahead by 
arguing that the language can speak about things 
that may have existed in the past or may exist in the 
future It is interesting to note that once we endorse 
these ideas the processing of Dravidian languages 
especially Dravidian literature becomes a task that 
can be quantised 
Now as suggested by Saba lets take a very simple 
a Olga is an old dancer
b Olga is an elderly teacher
BEAUTIFUL   or   her   DANCING   or   of   course 
both And for the second statement as  there is a 
unique object named Olga an object that must be of 
type Human and an object a of type Activity such 
that a is a teaching activity Olga is the agent of the 
activity and such that elderly is true of Olga
NLTK Natural Language Processing Kit can 
handle these using threading and combination of 
different rule types as shown Edward Loper and 
Steven Bird 2002 below
This   can   be   represented   quantitatively   using 
mathematical   expressions   But   we   are   after 
ontological representations So we can have show 
this as Saba 2008

The   Weighted   Transducers   Mehryar   Mohri 
Fernando Pereira Michael Riley 1996 method will

efficiency as shown below
Since the Dravidian languages are phonetic in 
nature   the   processing   becomes   easier   as   the 
presentations are simpler Just as in the final step 
we had Olga is a beautiful dancer as Olga is the 
agent of some dancing Activity and either Olga is 
4 Conclusion and Remarks
The   existing   structure   of   OLAC   can   easily   be 
extended by keeping the architecture structure as 
such to incorporate the copylefted contents from the 
Dravidian literature branch By opting for an 
effective cloud or parallel computing architecture 
the processing can be made effective and faster For 
best   results   we   need   to   follow   a   semantic   and 
ontological   structure   based   on   commonsense 
observations   rather   than   purely   engineering 
methodologies
