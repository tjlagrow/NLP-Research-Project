Abstract The secular evolution process which slowly transforms the
morphology of a given galaxy over its lifetime through mostly internal
dynamical mechanisms could naturally account for most of the observed
properties of physical galaxies Zhang 2003a As an emerging paradigm
for galaxy evolution its dynamical foundations had been established in
the past few years Zhang 1996 1998 1999 In this paper we explore
further implications of the secular morphological evolution process in re-
producing the well-known scaling relations of galaxies
1 Disk Galaxy Scaling Relations
A typical galaxy remains in a quasi-equilibrium conguration during the sec-
ular evolution process From the Virial theorem relation V 2  GMdynR
where Mdyn is the dynamical mass of the galaxy and the denition of aver-
age surface brightness SB  LR2 where L is the luminosity it follows that
L  V 4 1
MdynL2  In order to have a tight Tully-Fisher relation L  V 4 Tully
 Fisher 1977 we must have SBMdynL2  constant The secular evolution
process maintains the scaling relations by a decrease in galaxys dynamical-mass-
to-light ratio as the surface brightness of the galaxy increases during its Hubble
type transformation Zhang 2003b
The fundamental plane relation for spirals can likewise be derived from
the Virial theorem resulting in 10 log V  1  2Mt  SB  constant
where Mt is the absolute magnitude and SB is the average surface brightness
in magnitudearcsec2 and where MdynL  L Pharasyn et al 1997 found
that tting I band and K band data of a sample of spiral galaxies to this relation
resulted in   015
2 Elliptical Galaxy Fundamental Plane Relations
One of the many forms of the elliptical galaxy fundamental plane relation can be
expressed as L  V 345
SB086 or M Re  862log V  01SB  constant
Djorgovski  Davis 1987 where M Re refers to the absolute magnitude inside
eective radius Re A slight rearrangement of the terms in this equation leads to
10 log V  125M Re  SB  constant We see that apart from the constant
term the only dierence between the spiral and elliptical fundamental plane
relations is in the dierent signs of the mass-to-light ratio exponent    015

for spirals and   013 for ellipticals and bulges As the secular evolution
proceeds which generally leads to an increase in L the dynamical mass-to-light
ratio of a spiral galaxy decreases because a larger fraction of the baryonic dark
matter becomes luminous On the other hand elliptical galaxies are in more
advanced stages of evolution and will experience greater degree of dimming
which is reected in the increase of dynamical mass-to-light ratio with L
3 The Evolution Trend Revealed by the Three Types of Scaling
Relations
From the above three types of scaling relations we can easily derive the following
variations of the dependence of MdynL on mass and on light and the inter-
dependence of Mdyn and L
1 The dependence of mass on luminosity Mdyn  L05 from spiral Tully-
Fisher relation Mdyn  L085 from spiral fundamental plane relation Mdyn 
L112 from elliptical fundamental plane relation
2 The dependence of MdynL on luminosity MdynL  L05 from spiral
Tully-Fisher relation MdynL  L015 from spiral fundamental plane relation
MdynL  L013 from elliptical fundamental plane relation
3 The dependence of ML on dynamical mass MdynL  M 1

spiral Tully-Fisher relation MdynL  M 018
relation MdynL  M 01
dyn from elliptical fundamental plane relation
A gradual evolution trend of galaxy properties is thus implied in the three
types of scaling relations The fact that the MdynL ratio obtained from the
spiral galaxy fundamental plane relation lies intermediate between that given
by the spiral galaxy Tully-Fisher relation and the elliptical galaxy fundamental
plane relation is apparently due to the fact that within the spiral fundamental
plane relation there is the additional surface brightness parameter The spiral
fundamental plane eectively samples disk galaxy properties further inward
compared to the Tully-Fisher relation which samples characteristics averaged
over the whole disk More detailed discussion of the relation of the secular
evolution process to the generation of galaxy structural properties and scaling
relations can be found in Zhang 2003b
