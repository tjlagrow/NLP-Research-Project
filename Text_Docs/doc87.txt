Abstract Different structural parameter correlations show how classical bulge components
and elliptical galaxies are different from spiral and S0 galaxy disks irregular Im galaxies
and spheroidal Sph galaxies In contrast the latter apparently diverse galaxies or galaxy
components have almost identical parameter correlations This shows that they are related
A review of galaxy transformation processes suggests that S0 and spheroidal galaxies are
star-formation-quenched red and dead versions of spiral and Im galaxies In particular
Sph galaxies are bulgeless S0s This motivates a parallel sequence galaxy classication in
which an S0aS0bS0cSph sequence of decreasing bulge-to-total ratios is juxtaposed to an
SaSbScIm sequence of star-forming galaxies All parameter sequences show a complete
continuity from giant galaxies to the tiniest dwarfs Dwarfs are not a new or different class
of galaxies Rather they are the extreme products of transformation processes that get more
important as gravitational potential wells get more shallow Smaller Sph and SIm galaxies
have lower stellar densities because they retain fewer baryons Comparison of the baryonic
parameter correlations with those for dark matter halos allows us to estimate baryon loss as a
function of galaxy mass Extreme dwarfs are almost completely dominated by dark matter
1 A Parallel Sequence Galaxy Classication
This paper combines visible-galaxy scaling relations from Kormendy  Bender 2012 with
dark matter scaling relations from Kormendy  Freeman 2014 Results on visible galaxies
are conveniently encoded in a parallel sequence galaxy classication scheme shown in Fig 1
Fig 1 Parallel sequence galaxy classication including spheroidal Sph galaxies as bulgeless
S0 galaxies juxtaposed with irregular Im galaxies From Kormendy  Bender 2012
This updates a parallel sequence classication proposed by van den Bergh 1976 Kormendy
 Bender add Sph galaxies as S0s that have no bulge component This is motivated by the
observation that S0 galaxies have bulge-to-total luminosity ratios that range from almost 1 to
almost 0 see also Laurikainen et al 2010 Kormendy  Bender nd a continuous transition
in properties  including density proles but also kinematic properties  between S0 disks and
spheroidal galaxies Figure 2 shows the parameter correlations that illustrate this continuity
S0-like galaxies are given a diffferent name when they have no bulges They are called Sphs
Cappellari et al 2011 and Krajnovic et al 2011 propose a similar parallel sequence
classication without Sphs
Fig 2 Parameter correlations for ellipticals bulges Sph galaxies and S0 disks Bulges and
disks of S0s are plotted separately Plotted parameters are the major-axis effective radius re
that encloses half of the light of the galaxy component the effective brightness m e at re and
the total V -band absolute magnitude of the galaxy or galaxy component The middle panel
shows the Freeman 1970 result that disks of giant galaxies tend to have the same central
surface brightness m 0 Here m e  220 V mag arcsec2 corresponds for an exponential to
m 0  m e  182  202 V mag arcsec2  21 B mag arcsec2 brighter than Freemans value
2165 B mag arcsec2 because m e is not corrected to face-on orientation From Kormendy
 Bender 2012 who conclude 1 Sphs are continuous with the disks of S0 galaxies
2 The kink in the m e  MV relation at MV  18 where bulges disappear in Fig 4 marks the
transition to a baryon retention sequence tinier dwarf galaxies retain fewer baryons Fig 6
Continuity between Sphs and S0 disks is one reason why Fig 1 shows spheroidal galaxies as
bulgeless S0s Note that Sphs overlap in MV with but are distinct from bulges and elliptical
galaxies They are not dwarf ellipticals they are related to disks Kormendy 1985 1987
2 S0Sph Galaxies as Transformed SpiralIrregular Galaxies
The observational result that motivates the conclusions in this paper is illustrated in Figure 3
Samples now of hundreds of galaxies show The continuous parameter sequence dened by
Sphs and by the disks but not bulges of S0 galaxies is indistinguishable from the parameter
sequence dened by Magellanic irregular Im galaxies and by the disks but not bulges of
spiral galaxies This result was rst found for dwarf galaxies by Kormendy 1985 1987
Kormendy  Bender 2012 extend it to the highest-luminosity S and S0 disks
The most robust conclusion is that Sph galaxies S0 disks are related to Im galaxies  S
galaxy disks Both together are fundamentally different from classical bulges and ellipticals
This conclusion is also based on additional results that are not included in structural parameter
correlations one is that SS0 disks are at whereas bulgesellipticals are essentially three-
dimensional Understanding the above similarities and differences requires interpretation
but that interpretation now seems comfortably secure 1 Bulgeselliptical galaxies form
via major mergers whereas disksImSph galaxies form by cold gas accretion And more
directly from Figure 3 2 SphsS0 disks are transformed  i e star-formation-quenched 
red and dead versions of Im galaxies  S galaxy disks
Fig 3 Figure 2 parameter correlations with disks of Sa  Im galaxies added as blue points
When bulge-disk decomposition is necessary the two components are plotted separately
Disks are not corrected to face-on orientation The blue points represent 407 galaxes from 14
sources listed in the keys From Kormendy  Bender 2012 They conclude that structural
parameter correlations for Sa  Im galaxy disks are almost identical to those for S0  Sph
disks This conrms conclusions in Kormendy 1985 1987 using a large galaxy sample
3 SIm  S0Sph Galaxy Transformation Processes
Kormendy  Bender 2012 provide an ARAA-style review of physical processes that heat
galaxy disks and that use up or remove gas and so quench star formation They suggest that
the following processes all are important in transforming Im  S disks into Sph  S0 disks
1 Internal process Dekel  Silk 1986 see also Larson 1974 Saito 1979 suggest that
both the dIs and the dSphs have lost most of their mass in winds after the rst burst of
star formation and that this process determined their nal structural relations The dIs
somehow managed to retain a small fraction of their original gas while the dSphs either
have lost all of their gas at the rst burst of star formation or passed through a dI stage
before they lost the rest of the gas and turned dSph Kormendy and Bender conclude
that the Sph  Im sequence of decreasing surface brightness with decreasing galaxy
luminosity is a sequence of decreasing baryon retention emphasis in both originals
Figure 2 shows that surface brightnesses in the Sph S0 sequence start to decrease
at MVdisk  18 just where bulges disappear and where we therefore change galaxy
classications from S0 to Sph i e where plot symbols change from dark to light green
Figure 4 independently nds the S0Sph transition from rotation curve decompositions
As dark matter Vcirc decreases bulges decrease in importance relative to disks until they
disappear at Vcirc  104  16 km s1 The Tully-Fisher 1976 relation shows that this
corresponds to MV  19 for spirals Courteau et al 2007 and MV  18 for S0s
Bedregal et al 2006 It is probably not an accident that baryons start to be lost roughly
where bulges stop to contribute to the gravitational potential

V r decomposition papers are given there The dotted line indicates that rotation velocities

correlation is steeper than the disk correlation Bulges disappear at Vcirc  104  16 km s1
1 Continued The transition in Figures 2 and 3 to I suggest a baryon retention sequence
in smaller dwarfs corresponds within errors to the transition in edge-on galaxies from
giants that do to dwarfs that do not have well-dened dust lanes in their disk midplanes
Dalcanton et al 2004 They argue that the transition is not caused by changes in gas
density Rather they argue that it is caused by a transition in giant galaxies to a regime
in which disk instability leads to lower gas turbulence smaller gas scale heights and
enhanced star formation It is plausible that star formation is less efcient in smaller dwarfs
However The observation that dwarf Im and Sph galaxies show the same decrease in
surface brightness with decreasing luminosity shows that the dominant effect is not one
that depends on the presence of gas This favors the suggestion that the m eMV  relation
in Figures 2 and 3 is a baryon retention sequence at MV  18 See also Figure 6
It may be surprising that SphS0 and ImS galaxies have similar surface brightnesses
because the latter are star-forming and so presumably have smaller mass-to-light ratios
However 1 at high luminosities internal absorption partly compensates for smaller
mass-to-light ratios and 2 at low luminosities star formation in Im galaxies is gentle
Nevertheless it is fair to emphasize that more work is needed to understand the detailed
engineering that results in SphS0 and ImS correlations that look so nearly identical
2 Environmental processes I Ram-pressure stripping  long underestimated in importance 
is now An Idea Whose Time Has Come Gunn  Gott 1972 suggested based on the
detection of X-ray-emitting hot gas in the Coma cluster Meekins et al 1971 Gursky et al
1971 that a typical galaxy moving in it will be stripped of its interstellar material We
expect no normal spirals in the central regions of clusters like Coma The lack of such
systems is of course observed emphasis in the original Calculations persuaded some
people to neglect ram-pressure stripping even while many observations provided indirect
evidence for its importance Spirals near the center of the Virgo cluster are decient in H I
gas Cayette et al 1990 1994 Chung et al 2009 Also Faber  Lin 1983 Lin  Faber
1983 Kormendy 1987 van den Bergh 1994b and Kormendy et al 2009 hereafter
KFCB suggested that Sph galaxies are ram-pressure-stripped dSIm galaxies based
in part on observations Einasto et al 1974 van den Bergh 1994a 1994b Mateo 1998
that  with a few understandable exceptions  close dwarf companions of Local Group
giant galaxies are almost all spheroidals that distant companions are irregulars and that
galaxies with intermediate SphIm morphologies live at intermediate distances Ever
since van den Bergh 1976 these ideas provided the interpretation of a parallel sequence
classication Figure 1 here that was constructed operationally to encode the full range
of S0Sph bulge-to-total luminosity ratios BT from almost 1 to exactly 0
Spectacular observations of ram-pressure stripping in action now clearly demonstrate the
importance of this process see Sun et al 2010 Kormendy  Bender 2012 for reviews
Kenney et al 2004 2008 Oosterloo  van Gorkom 2005 and Chung et al 2007 2009
nd that many spiral galaxies near the center of the Virgo cluster show long Ha or H I
tails interpreted to be cold gas that is being stripped by the ambient X-ray-emitting gas
Bohringer et al 1994 Kormendy and Bender emphasize that these galaxies and the
H I - depleted galaxies are substantially brighter than almost all Sphs If even the deep
gravitational potential wells of still-spiral galaxies suffer H I stripping then the shallow
potential wells of dS  Im galaxies are more likely to be stripped The most impressive
recent example of ram-pressure stripping is the multi-wavelength CO gasH IIX-ray
tail of the galaxy ESO 137-001 in Abell 3627 Sun et al 2006 2007 2010 Woudt et
al 2008 Sivanandam et al 2010 Pavel et al 2014 Figure 5 here
For a recent treatment of ram-pressure stripping in the Galactic halo see Gatto et al 2013
Fig 5 Composite Hubble Space Telescope HST and Chandra X-Ray Observatory image of
galaxy ESO 137-001 in Abell 3627 The HST image is a I- g- and U-band color composite
Added in blue is the X-ray image it extends the lighter blue optical streaks of ongoing star
formation toward the lower-right This material is interpreted to be ram-pressure stripped
The image source is httpwwwspacetelescopeorgimagesheic1404b
and httpapodnasagovapodap140328html At a distance of  64 Mpc
the absolute magnitude of ESO 137-001 is MV  208 Conveniently this eld of view also
shows a normal-looking Sph galaxy at upper-right it is  3 mag fainter than ESO 137-001
Again if we see a giant galaxy caught in the process of undergoing ram-pressure stripping
it is not surprising that a much smaller Sph galaxy is thoroughly red and dead
3 Environmental processes II Dynamical harassment results from many high-speed encounters
with other galaxies in a cluster and with the overall cluster potential Simulations show that
1 it promotes gas ow toward galaxy centers 2 it heats disks especially vertically and
3 it strips off the outer parts of galaxies Moore et al 1996 1998 1999 Lake et al 1998
Even in poor environments like the Local Group tidal stirring of dwarfs on elliptical orbits
around the Galaxy or M 31 should have similar effects Mayer et al 2001a b 2006 One
success of this picture is that inowing gas can feed star formation and help to explain why
spheroidals in which star formation stopped long ago do not have lower surface brightnesses
than current versions of SIm progenitors Figure 3 This process is clean and inescapable
Kormendy  Bender 2012 conclude that dynamical harassment is much more important
in the Virgo cluster than we thought Edge-on S0s with close companions show warps in their
outer disks that will phase-wrap around the center into structures that resemble Sphs in their
shapes and density proles NGC 4762 and NGC 4452 their Figures 4 and 8 respectively
They identify S0Sph transition objects 1 NGC 4638 is an edge-on S0 with a Gaussian i e
radially truncated inner disk embedded in a boxy E3 halo that has the properties of a large
Sph their Figures 13  16 2 VCC 2048 is an E6 Sph with an embedded edge-on S0 disk
their Figures 10  12 Indeed many Virgo S0s have Gaussian disk proles Most telling is
the observation that several Virgo cluster S0s have bars embedded in steep- often Gaussian-
prole lenses with no sign of a disk outside the bar NGC 4340 NGC 4442 and NGC 4483
their  A12 We do not know how to form a bar that lls the whole disk because an outer
disk is generally required as an angular momentum sink to allow a bar to grow Kormendy and
Bender suggest that the outer disks in these galaxies have been heated or stripped off Finally
they interpret the new class of dwarfs that are of huge size and very low surface brightness
Sandage  Binggeli 1984 as spheroidals that have been harassed almost to death
4 Environmental processes III Starvation of late growth by cold-gas infall Larson et al 1980
seems inevitable in environments like the center of the Virgo cluster where the ambient gas
is very hot Even in environments like the Local Group Sph galaxies that orbit around the
Galaxy and M 31 at velocities V  200 km s1 are unlikely to encounter cold gas slowly
enough to be able to accrete it And much of the gas in the Local Group may in any case be
in a warm-hot intergalactic medium WHIM Dave et al 2001
So Kormendy  Bender 2012 suggest that the relevant question is not Which of these
mechanisms is correct It is How can you stop any of them from happening It seems likely
that all of the above processes matter Engineering details probably depend on environment
4 Visible Matter and Dark Matter Parameter Correlations
 18 the dwarf spiral Im and Sph galaxies
Figure 6 illustrates our conclusion that at MV 
in earlier gures form a sequence of decreasing baryon retention in smaller galaxies KFCB
Kormendy  Bender 2012 Kormendy  Freeman 2014 In contrast bulges and ellipticals
Fig 6 Comparison of dark matter DM halo parameters from Kormendy  Freeman 2014
with visible matter parameters from Kormendy  Bender 2012 DM parameters are from
maximum-disk rotation curve decompositions black circles or from cored isothermal halo
models applied to the dispersion proles of dSph galaxies black triangles or to the V cid181
rotation curves and velocity dispersions of H I in dIm galaxies upside-down black triangles
see Kormendy  Freeman 2014 the source of this gure Central projected densities are
plotted for DM halos effective surface densities S e  S re are shown for visible components
Here re is the radius that contains half of the light of the component Surface brightnesses are
converted to stellar surface densities using mass-to-light ratios MLV  8 for ellipticals 5 for
classical bulges and S0 disks and 2 for spiral galaxy disks Im galaxies and Sph galaxies
together form a sequence of increasing dissipation during the formation of smaller galaxies
For MV  18 galaxies of all kinds effective densities in stars are similar to DM densities
at and interior to the same radius For ScIm systems this is by construction a consequence
1 of using maximum-disk decompositions and 2 of the rotation curve conspiracy van
Albada  Sancisi 1986 i e the observation that rotation curves of giant galaxies are roughly
at and featureless so the parts of galaxies that are controlled by dark matter are not easily
distinguished from the parts that are controlled by visible matter or even the parts that are
controlled by different components in the visible matter Figure 4 Caveat for bulges and
ellipticals high baryon densities at r  re may pull on DM halos enough to increase their
central densities over the values for Sc  Im galaxies that are shown in Figure 6 But bulges
and ellipticals have central projected densities that are more than 3 dex higher than the
effective densities shown in Figure 6 So the central parts of early-type galaxies are very
baryon-dominated Even the central densities of disks are 07 dex for an exponential higher
than the effective densities shown in Fig 6 So even pure disks are moderately dominated
by visible matter near their centers Both results are qualitatively as expected Visible matter
needs to dissipate sink inside the DM and become self-gravitating enough to form stars and
visible galaxies And a great deal of dissipation happens in the wet mergers that make normal
ellipticals KFCB their densities rise above DM densities by larger amounts at fainter MV 
The important point here is this At MV  18 tinier dwarfs are more DM dominated
 10 they are essentially dark galaxies with just enough of a frosting of stars
until by MV 
so that they can be detected I emphasize two important points 1 The differences between
dIm and dSph galaxies in all parameter correlations shown in this paper are small Whether
or not a galaxy retains cold gas and can still form stars in todays Universe is a second-order
effect This argues  as Dekel  Silk 1986 already emphasized  that the primary effect that
engineers the parameter correlations is supernova-driven baryon blowout or another process
such as a failure to capture baryons before cosmic reionization that has the same effect 2
Kormendy  Freeman 2014 suggest that there exists a large population of tiny halos that
 13 represent a
are essentially completely dark and that the discoverable galaxies at MV 
smaller and smaller fraction of tinier DM halos This has been suggested as the solution to
the problem that the uctuation spectrum of cold dark matter predicts more dwarfs than are
observed in environments like the Local Group e g Moore et al 1999 Klypin et al 1999
5 Conclusions
Kormendy  Bender 2012 propose a parallel sequence galaxy classication Figure 1 here
in which Sph galaxies appear as bulgeless S0s juxtaposed with Im galaxies In reality their
progenitors can include late-type spirals but the Fig 1 tuning fork is designed for simplicity
S0Sph galaxies are suggested to be star-formation-quenched descendants of SIm galaxies
It seems essentially guaranteed that all transformation processes discussed in 3 are important
Moreover although there is good agreement between structural parameter correlations for 1
present-day SphsS0 disks and 2 present-day ImS disks it is of course not guaranteed
that the progenitors of Sph and S0 galaxies were exactly like present-day late-type galaxies
The latter are after all survivors The reasons can partly involve stochastic evolution but
they may also involve differences in internal structure andor environment
These ideas are slowly gaining acceptance An observationally biased but still incomplete
list of papers includes Grebel et al 2003 van Zee et al 2004 Mayer et al 2006 Boselli et
al 2008a b Tolstoy et al 2009 Rys et al 2013 2014 and Janz et al 2013 KFCB and
Kormendy  Bender 2012 address remaining controversies
From the perspective of this conference the important  and robust  conclusion is this
Dwarf spiral irregular and spheroidal galaxies are not new and special kinds of galaxies
as has often been suggested Rather There is a complete continuity in structural parameter
scaling relations Figures 2  4 and 6 kinematics and dynamics star formation properties
and metallicity distributions between the disks of giant galaxies and all three subsets of dwarf
galaxies Fainter than MV  18 the properties of galaxies change as their gravitational
potential wells get more shallow this is qualitatively consistent with the increased importance
at lower masses of internal and environmental transformation processes Also many aspects
of galaxy evolution get more stochastic in smaller galaxies For example star formation gets
more bursty Many quantitative details remain to be worked out But this is engineering
A big-picture view of the evolution of dwarf galaxies seems comfortably in place
All forms of violence  including supernova energy feedback dynamical harassment and
external ram-pressure stripping  get more important for smaller galaxies The main result
is that smaller galaxies lose more of their baryons or never acquire them Smaller dwarfs
are more dominated by dark matter Whether or not they retain enough cold gas to feed some
star formation is very much a second-order effect Baryon loss at low halo masses may be so
severe that we discover only a small fraction of the smallest essentially dark halos This can
reconcile the observed scarcity of dwarf galaxies in eld environments with our expectations
of large numbers of dwarfs that are predicted by the cold dark matter uctuation spectrum
