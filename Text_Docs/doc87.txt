Abstract
How cells reliably infer information about their environment is a fundamentally important question
While sensing and signaling generally start with cell-surface receptors the degree of accuracy with which
a cell can measure external ligand concentration with even the simplest device - a single receptor - is
surprisingly hard to pin down Recent studies provide conicting results for the fundamental physical
limits Comparison is made dicult as dierent studies either suggest dierent readout mechanisms of
the ligand-receptor occupancy or dier on how ligand diusion is implemented Here we critically analyse
these studies and present a unifying perspective on the limits of sensing with wide-ranging biological
implications
Introduction
In 1977 physicists Howard Berg and Edward Purcell published their results on the fundamental biological
problem of sensing 1 The question they addressed was how accurately a biological cell viewed as a
tiny measurement device can sense its chemical environment using cell-surface receptors The paper is
not only highly cited but more importantly a large fraction of the citations stems from the last ten
In essence the message of the paper
years demonstrating how far ahead of its time the study was
was simple sensing in the microscopic world boils down to counting molecules which arrive at the
cell surface by diusion Humans encounter a similar limit when we try to see in the near dark as
our photoreceptors count single photons 2 Berg and Purcells paper has inuenced many elds of
quantitative biology including nutrient scavenging 3 5 7 mating 6 signal transduction 7 7 gene
regulation 8 cell division 911 and embryonic development 12 While there is no disagreement on
the importance of knowing the fundamental physical limits of sensing there has been disagreement on
what this limit is even for a single receptor The analysis here interprets and unies these studies to
yield a coherent picture of the limits of sensing
Overview
To introduce the topic and to build intuition we follow Berg and Purcell 1 and begin with simple
models for measuring ligand concentration c0 The rst is the Perfect Monitor 1 This model assumes a
permeable sphere of radius a capable of counting the number of molecules N inside its volume Fig 1a
For concreteness the sphere might represent a bacterial cell Since the molecules diuse independently
nding a molecule in one small volume element is independent of nding another one in a dierent small
volume element and so the number of molecules N will be Poisson distributed Since for the Poisson
distribution the variance equals the mean ie N 2  N omitting ensemble-averaging brackets for
Figure 1 Simple measurement devices for concentration a The Perfect Monitor is permeable
to ligand molecules and estimates the concentration c0 by counting the molecules in its volume during
time T  b The Perfect Absorber estimates the ligand concentration from the number of molecules
incident on its surface during time T 
simplicity of notation we obtain for a single measurement snapshot
N 2 
where c0 is a xed given ligand concentration and V is the volume of the monitoring sphere However
if we assume the Perfect Monitor has some time T available to make a measurement the uncertainty in
the estimate of the true ligand concentration can be further reduced In time T  the Perfect Monitor
can make approximately M  T D statistically independent measurements where D  a2D is the
diusive turnover time for the molecules inside the sphere This leads to the reduced uncertainty
T Dc0V 
where we neglect prefactors for this heuristic derivation The exact result is 35Dac0T  which can
be derived by considering autocorrelations of the molecules inside the volume 1
However the Perfect Monitor is not the best one can do A more accurate estimate can be made if
each ligand molecule is only measured once rather than being allowed to diuse in and out of the sphere
Thus we consider a perfectly absorbing sphere 5 estimating concentration from the number of absorbed
ligand molecules NT in time T  and nd Fig 1b
4Dac0T
5Dac0T
This Perfect Absorber is thus more accurate than the Perfect Monitor and even more so for spatial
gradient sensing by almost a factor of 10 5 This result contrasts with Berg and Purcells original
suggestion that rebinding previously measured ligand molecules does not increase the uncertainty in
measurement 1 However one of their many key insights was that a sphere with many absorbing
patches for ligand is nearly as good at sensing as a fully absorbing sphere making room for multiple
receptor types with dierent ligand specicity without sacricing much accuracy
Figure 2 Measuring ligand concentration with a single receptor a A receptor binds ligand
with rate kc0 when unbound and unbinds ligand when bound with rate k b Time series of
receptor occupancy during time interval T  Berg and Purcell considered the accuracy obtained by
taking the average dashed horizontal line
Single receptor without ligand rebinding
The single receptor is the simplest measurement device and thus needs to be thoroughly understood
Unfortunately dierent approaches to estimating its sensing accuracy have resulted in signicant dis-
crepancies We rst disregard the eects of diusion and rebinding of previously bound ligands and just
consider ligand binding and unbinding
Consider the receptor shown in Fig 2a which binds ligand with rate kc0 when unbound and
unbinds ligand with rate k when bound The probability of being bound is then p  c0c0  KD with
KD  kk the ligand dissociation constant A potential time series of receptor occupancy t during
time T is illustrated in Fig 2b Berg and Purcell argued that the best a cell can do to estimate the
ligand concentration is to average the occupancy t over time For such an average the variance 2
was derived from the autocorrelations of occupancy leading to the relative uncertainty in estimating the
ligand concentration
where the derivative pc is the gain or amplication Naively one could be tempted to set 2 
p1  p equal to the variance of a Bernoulli random variable binomial trials However this would
correspond to the uncertainty in the concentration estimate following a single instantaneous observation
of the state of the receptor or equivalently to the frequency integral of the noise power spectrum 2 
R d2S see Supplementary Information for details This snapshot limit can be improved if we
assume T 1kc0  1k ie that the receptor is allowed to average over a time T much larger than
the correlation time of ligand binding and unbinding In this case one can take the low-frequency limit
2  S  0T instead and Eq 4 leads to the Berg-Purcell limit for a single receptor
N 
2Dac01  pT
where b  1k is the average duration of a bound interval The simple formulation as 2 N follows
because the average number of binding and unbinding events in time T is N  T b  u where
u  kc01 is the average duration of an unbound interval The nal result in Eq 5 follows from
detailed balance for diusion-limited binding
But is it true that averaging receptor occupancy is the best way to estimate concentration More
recently a limit lower than Eq 5 was found by applying maximum-likelihood estimation to a time series
cid18c0
ccid192
t of receptor occupancy 13 Here the probability P  c of observing a time series  is maximised
with respect to the concentration c The resulting best estimate of the concentration comes only from the
unbound intervals since only they depend on the rate of binding and thus on the ligand concentration
To obtain a lower limit on the uncertainty the Cramer-Rao bound 14 can be used leading to
0Ic0 
where Ic0  2 lnP c2 is the Fisher information evaluated at c0 and averaged over all trajectories
with the same N when employing maximum-likelihood estimation it is easier to work with a xed
number of bindingunbinding events N than a xed time T  The limit on the right-hand side of Eq 6 is
obtained for long time series for which the inequality becomes an equality Note however that a slightly
sharper bound 1N  2 can be obtained when using a further improved estimator see Supplementary
Information Eq 6 shows that the uncertainty in Eq 5 can be reduced by a factor of two This is
because only unbound intervals carry information about the ligand concentration In contrast the bound
intervals only increase the uncertainty and hence are discarded by the maximum-likelihood procedure
What does the maximum-likelihood result imply about tuning receptor parameters to minimise the
uncertainty The minimal uncertainty is obtained for Nmax the maximal number of binding events
provided by very fast unbinding k   This ideal limit corresponds to the Perfect Absorber
from Eq 3 as every binding event is counted However the increased accuracy comes at the expense
of specicity as any ligand molecule dissociates immediately and hence dierent ligand types cannot
be dierentiated Maximum-likelihood estimation can also be extended to ramp sensing temporal
gradients 15 and multiple receptors 16 17
Adding a downstream signaling molecule cannot increase the accuracy of sensing in fact this only
adds noise For example consider an integrating receptor a la Berg and Purcell which signals while being
ligand bound Fig 3a 20 In this simple network a downstream signaling molecule with concentration
n is phosphorylated by ligand-bound receptors with the phosphorylated concentration given by np with
lifetime  beyond this time the protein converts back to the unphosphorylated form Now instead
of taking the snapshot limit ie
p we time average to reduce the uncertainty
Specically let us assume a long averaging time that is T    1kc0  1k allowing us to use
again the low-frequency limit of the corresponding power spectrum We then obtain see Supplementary

Eq 8 shows that by integrating receptor output one cannot do better than the Berg-Purcell limit given
by the rst term The second term represents additional Poisson-like noise from number uctuations of
the signaling molecule due to imperfect averaging 21 For T  the Berg-Purcell limit is approached
from time averaging this noise While we focus here on averaging in time of stationary stimuli non-
stationary ligand concentrations may be more accurately sensed via non-uniform time averaging requiring
appropriately designed signaling cascades 22
There has been some confusion about whether sensing actually costs energy On the one hand C H
Bennett pointed out long ago that sensing does not need to cost if done reversibly and hence extremely
slowly 23 On the other hand cells obviously consume energy eg using ATP to phosphorylate
proteins
In other words what energy cost is actually necessary for performing a measurement As
stressed by the authors in 20 the process of sensing in terms of ligand-receptor binding does not need
Figure 3 Three schemes of receptor readout a Integrating receptor which signals while ligand
bound left 1 For example the active receptor might phosphorylate a protein with concentration n
The concentration of the phosphorylated protein is np right b Alternatively the receptor may
signal in generic bursts at onset of ligand binding left 13 This scheme can be implemented by an
energy-driven cycle of L activebound receptor conformations which reduces variability right 18 c
A receptor could also retain a memory of previous binding and unbinding events potentially improving
its accuracy of sensing 5
to cost energy if done using an equilibrium receptor in the spirit of Berg and Purcell However to
accurately infer the external ligand concentration the cell needs to time average which cannot be done
without consuming energy This is in line with the Landauer erasure principle 24 which predicts a
lower theoretical limit of energy consumption of a computation
In essence to keep a record of the
past for averaging old information needs to be erased and time-reversal symmetry broken 25 Time
averaging can be implemented by phosphorylation of a downstream protein when the receptor is bound
it phosphorylates and when unbound it dephosphorylates Since these are energetically driven reactions
the reverse reaction eg dephosphorylation by a bound receptor is extremely unlikely and time averaging
is very ecient The issue of the cost was avoided in Berg and Purcells analysis by providing an eective
averaging time T without specifying how this averaging is achieved
How is the maximum-likelihood result Eq 6 useful The maximum-likelihood result makes inter-
esting predictions about sophisticated sensing strategies cells might employ For example to implement
maximum likelihood in the fast unbinding limit a receptor should only signal upon a ligand-binding event
as illustrate in Fig 3b thin arrows rather than continuously signaling while ligand is bound see 26 for
further discussion How can the cell achieve such short and well-dened signaling durations Reducing
variability and achieving determinism requires energy consumption and irreversible cycles 18 Examples
may include ligand-gated ion channels 27 and single-photon responses in rhodopsin of rod cells 28
Maximum likelihood provides another valuable insight - it shows that information from an estimate
and memory from a prior are equivalent and both can contribute to lowering the uncertainty Fig 3c
This kind of receptor learning from past estimates can be implemented using the Bayesian Cramer-Rao
bound for the uncertainty Using prior information I one obtains 5

assuming the prior had variance 1N  identical to the actual measurement Importantly memory can even
help in uctuating environments if a ltering scheme is implemented by the cell 5 if the environment
uctuates weakly andor with long temporal correlations memory improves precision signicantly If on
the other hand the environment uctuates very strongly andor without any correlations the cell can
still rely on the current measurement and disregard memory A form of memory is implemented by
receptor methylation in bacterial chemotaxis 29 and in principle memory could be implemented by any
slow process in the cell eg the expression of LacY permease in enzyme induction in the lac system 30
or the remodelling of the actin cortex in eukaryotic chemotaxis 31 32
Single receptor with ligand rebinding
So far we have neglected the possibility of rebinding by previously bound ligands In fact the role of
ligand rebinding in the accuracy of sensing is a tricky issue because rebinding can introduce non-trivial
correlations between binding events In practice these correlations can only be included approximately
in analytical calculations and so the question is how to proceed Originally Berg and Purcell made the
reasonable suggestion that a molecule that fails to bind to a receptor may return to the receptor by
diusion and rebind and that this eect may be included by considering diusion-limited binding with
a renormalised receptor size 1 However the question is how to formally separate ligand binding and
unbinding from ligand diusion
Bialek and Setayeshgar addressed this problem by coupling ligand-receptor binding and unbinding to
the diusion equation 7 Assuming that the averaging time is long compared to the typical binding and
unbinding time the low-frequency limit can be used This results in
kc01  pT
Dac0T
with a now the size of the receptor Equation 10 indicates noise contributions from two independent
sources According to Ref 7 the rst term represents binding and unbinding noise and depends on the
rate parameters while the second depends on diusion and was interpreted as a Berg-Purcell-like noise
oor However we argue for a dierent interpretation For diusion-limited binding the rst term in
Eq 10 is not zero but rather k needs to be set to a Kramer-like expression which is proportional to
the diusion constant 33 and an Arrhenius factor at most equal to one 34 Due to their dependence
on the diusion constant both terms can be combined 35 Indeed for diusion-limited binding it is
the rst not the second term of Eq 10 that captures the Berg-Purcell limit Since Berg and Purcell
did not consider rebinding by diusion the second term constitutes increased noise due to a rebinding
correction that does not arise in Berg and Purcells derivation 1 Bialek and Setayeshgar also applied
their method to multiple receptors and showed that the second term can introduce correlations among
receptors as ligand unbinding at one receptor can lead to re-binding at another nearby receptor 35 36
Hence while multiple independent receptors allow for spatial averaging 37 mutual rebinding among
dierent receptors by diusion increases the uncertainty of sensing
More recently Kaizu et al readdressed this problem 8 by applying a formalism developed by Agmon
and Szabo for diusion-inuenced reactions 39 By calculating survival probabilities of bimolecular
reactions with a number of simplifying assumptions see below they obtained for the relative uncertainty
of a single receptor
kc01  pT
2Dac01  pT
Similar to Bialek and Setayesghar there are two noise contributions with the rst terms in Eq 10 and
11 formally identical The second term is however dierent While the lost factor 2 in the second term
in Eq 11 can be traced to dierent denitions of the receptor geometry cubic in Eq 10 and spherical
in Eq 11 the factor 1  p in Eq 11 is missing from Eq 10 Due to this factor both terms of the
uncertainty in Eq 11 diverge if the receptor is fully bound on average p  1 while in Eq 10 only the
rst term diverges Unlike Eq 10 Kaizu et al made the additional assumption that during a bound
interval the external ligand equilibrates As a result an unbound ligand molecule cannot diuse away
and rebind at a later time with another ligand bound in between However using exact simulations they
showed that such delayed rebinding is only a minor eect under biologically relevant conditions Hence
as the factor 1  p in the second term of Eq 11 also appears in the Berg-and-Purcell limit Eq 5 Kaizu
et al argue that their result is more accurate than Eq 10
However we propose a slightly dierent interpretation of Eq 11 Similar to 7 we suggest that
the second term is not the Berg-Purcell limit Eq 5 for diusion-limited binding since the rst term
captures the Berg-Purcell limit 8 As described above for diusion-limited binding the rst term cannot
be neglected This aside how may the factor 1  p in the second term be interpreted In Kaizu et als
derivation diusion means that a ligand molecule enters the ligand pocket of a receptor without actually
binding hence the factor 1  p in the second term since they assume only an unbound receptor can be
approached by a ligand molecule In Bialek and Setayeshgars derivation no such factor appears as the
second term describes uctuations in ligand concentration simply in the vicinity of the receptor Can
further insight into the eects of diusion be obtained by yet an alternative method
Maximum-likelihood estimation can also be applied to a receptor with ligand diusion albeit only
in a special case The probability of observing a time series of receptor occupancy of N binding and
unbinding events can be formally written down even with diusion 13 However the rate of binding will
depend on the current ligand concentration which is inuenced by the history of all previous binding
and unbinding events even before the rst recorded binding event To estimate the uncertainty the
Cramer-Rao bound can be applied but cannot be evaluated exactly Nevertheless for fast diusion or slow
binding an approximate expression can be derived for both 2D and 3D see Supplementary Information

In Eq 12 the average local excess ligand concentration c due to previous binding and unbinding
events is kc04Dln4Dkcaa2 in 2D and kc02Da in 3D for the derivation half occupancy
p12  12 is required The ratios in the excess concentration reect the competition between rebinding
and diusion As expected in 2D this concentration decays more slowly to zero with increasing diusion
constant than in 3D and also the spatial dependence on the receptor size is weaker in 2D than in 3D
Coming back to the dierent receptor models with diusion the rst term of Eq 12 produces exactly
half the uncertainty of the rst terms of Bialek and Setayeshgar Eq 10 and Kaizu et al Eq 11
by utilizing only the unbound time intervals However due to factor 1  p the second term of Eq 12
resembles the second term of Kaizu et al both Eq 11 and Eq 12 for 3D use a spherical receptor This
suggests that Kaizu et al is the correct result for the accuracy of sensing by time averaging while Eq
12 is the more accurate result when using maximum-likelihood estimation

Single receptor as a decision maker
All the above approaches considered the accuracy based on a xed measurement time or number of
binding and unbinding events However similar to humans cells might follow a dierent strategy
and approach a problem from a decision-making perspective 9 40 either deciding based on existing
information or waiting to accumulate more data
Recently Siggia and Vergassola considered decision making in the context of cells proposing that
the above maximum-likelihood estimate can further be improved in this way 9 The simplest imple-
mentation of a decision-making strategy is the so-called Wald algorithm 42 For a single receptor the
Wald algorithm requires calculating the ratio R of the likelihoods of the time series of binding and un-
binding events of a receptor  data conditioned to either of two hypothesised values of external ligand
concentration
The cell then concludes that the ligand concentration is c1 if R  H1 that the ligand concentration is c2
if R  H2 or keeps collecting data if H1  R  H2 H1 and H2 are thresholds that set the probability
of error ie concluding the concentration is c1 if the true concentration is c2 and vice versa This
algorithm by not having a xed-time constraint can be shown to be optimal ie the average time to
make a decision between the two options is shorter than provided by any other algorithm with the same
accuracy decision-error probability
How can decision making be compared with maximum-likelihood estimation and the Berg-Purcell
limit Siggia and Vergassola suggested a xed-time log-likelihood-ratio estimation a la Eq 13 based on
the Neyman-Pearson lemma Due to the xed-time constraint the Neyman-Pearson algorithm is in spirit
similar to maximum-likelihood estimation Siggia and Vergassola showed that the Wald algorithm leads
to a shorter decision-making time on average than the Neyman-Pearson algorithm and so suggested
that the Wald algorithm provides the ultimate limit for sensing
The result for the Wald algorithm indeed shares properties with the maximum-likelihood estimate and
the Berg-Purcell limit All three reveal a dependence of the measurement decision time on the inverse
P c1
P c2
of the square of the dierence of concentration ie c2 Although no decision making is involved in
maximum-likelihood estimation or the Berg-Purcell limit one can still conclude that concentrations c1
and c2 can be distinguished if the measurement uncertainty is smaller than the dierence c2  c2 c12
and that assuming either c1 or c2 as the true value an incorrect decision occurs if measurement returns
a value closer to the wrong concentration This way a decision error can be converted into a type of
measurement uncertainty and vice versa see Supplementary Information for details
Fig 4a shows the thus derived uncertainty in measuring a ligand concentration by the Wald algo-
rithm and the Neyman-Pearson lemma as a function of average measurement time For comparison the
maximum-likelihood estimate and the Berg-Purcell limit are shown in Fig 4b However since the xed-
time likelihood algorithms Neyman-Pearson lemma and maximum-likelihood estimate do not agree it
is dicult to directly compare Wald with the Berg-Purcell limit After all Wald and Neyman-Pearson
algorithms are about hypothesis testing and discrimination while time averaging Berg-Purcell and
maximum likelihood are about estimation
What types of algorithm are cells actually implementing Consider chemotaxis in the bacterium
Escherichia coli as a prototypical example of chemical sensing Downstream signaling especially slow
motor switching could provide a time scale for Berg-Purcell-type time averaging In contrast biological
systems with hysteresis that is two dierent thresholds for activation and deactivation of the downstream
pathway may implement a type of decision-making algorithm The classical example is the lactose
utilisation system in E coli which can be stimulated by the non-metabolisable gratuitous inducer
TMG 30 40 When TMG is high enough enzymes of the lac system become induced Once induced
however the TMG level must be reduced below a much lower threshold in order to uninduce the lac
system
Outlook
While the question of the physical limits of sensing has been around for decades only over the last
few years has the importance of this question become clear and its predictions testable by quantitative
experiments 43 44 While current work is mostly about chemical sensing the limits of sensing other
stimuli such as substrate stiness during durotaxis or temperature pH particles and combinations
of them etc may be next For such measurements the role of domain size and spatial dimension
are interesting questions Measurements are often done inside a cell on 2D surfaces or along 1D DNA
molecules and correlations due to rebinding depend on these parameters 45
The question of the limits of sensing has also opened up completely new directions including the role of
active energy-consuming sensing strategies 18 20 46 47 and hence the importance of nonequilibrium-
physical processes in cell biology This then connects to the Landauer limit of information erasure
and cellular computation in general 48 49 In this area important questions are linking information
theory statistical inference and thermodynamics eg in order to produce generalized second laws 50
Additionally analysis may move away from only considering receptors to considering receptors and their
downstream signaling pathways and questions of optimal resource allocation in such pathways emerge
Other areas of study have started to benet from this work as well such as gene regulation For
instance why do cells often use bursty frequency modulation of gene expression under stress and in
development 51 This may either reect a need for accurately sensing and monitoring chemical cues or
simply enhance robustness eg similar to when information is transmitted between neurons by action
potentials The questions whether cells sense at the physical limit and if so how they reach it and how
to design experiments to answer these questions will occupy us for a while

1 Berg-Purcell limit
Consider a receptor which binds and unbinds ligand molecules with kinetics for the average occupancy
t given by
 kc01    k
where kc0 is the rate of binding at ligand concentration c and k is the rate of unbinding At steady
state the probability of being occupied is given by p  c0c0  KD with the ligand dissociation constant
KD  kk
What is the uncertainty hc2i in measuring ligand concentration c0 If we have the uncertainty in
occupancy h2i we can use error propagation and write for the relative uncertainty in ligand concen-
tration
h2i
cid18c

with the term in bracket evaluated at c0
To obtain h2i we could be tempted to use the variance of a Bernoulli random variable given by
p1  p We would thus obtain hc2ic0
2  p1  p1  4 and hence at least 400 fractional error
This instantaneous error based on a single measurement in time can formally be derived as follows
which comes in handy later Equation 14 can be linearised around the steady-state value by introducing
t  p  t with t the uctuations and keeping only terms linear in t This produces

with t the uctuating source given by white noise with zero average That such a linearization is
valid for underlying binary dynamics was shown in 1 Subsequent Fourier transformation from the time
to the frequency domain leads to

In contrast Berg and Purcell BP considered that the receptor has some time T available in order to
produce a measurement We expect the longer the averaging time the more accurate the measurement
Imagine a binary time series of occupancy t recorded for time T  The BP limit can be derived by
estimating the average receptor occupancy p from the time-averaged value T  1TR dt t with the

2 Receptor with downstream signalling
In addition to the receptor let us consider a signalling molecule that is produced by the ligand-bound
receptor characterised by occupancy t The kinetics for the copy number nt of this signalling
molecule is given by
 k   1n
where k times  is the rate of production and  is the lifetime of the signalling molecule At steady state
the copy number is given by n  k p Using error propagation once more we can write

transforming from the time to the frequency domain leads to

with N   b  u the average number of ligand bindingunbinding events in time interval  and N

in Eq 28 is due to Poisson-like number uctuations in the signalling molecule and could be reduced for
large numbers of signalling molecules Hence the best one can do with an equilibrium receptor is the BP
3 Maximum-likelihood estimation without ligand rebinding
Let N be a xed number of subsequent bound and unbound time intervals not the average number N
here the probability likelihood for such a sequence of intervals   1 N  is
P   c  ekTb ekcTukN
i1  i
 kcN 
where Tb  PN

b and Tu  PN
i1  i
u are the total bound and unbound times with Tb  Nhui and
 kTuP 
P  0  cML 
ie cML is the concentration value that maximises the likelihood The uncertainty in concentration mea-
surement can be obtained from the Cramer-Rao bound which connects the uncertainty in concentration
to the Fisher information
Assume a set of measurements  distributed according to P   c from which an unbiased estimation
of the concentration c0 is performed In general it can be shown that given a set of measurements the
variance for the expected value of c is bound from below by the Fisher information ie
with c the estimated value of the true concentration c0 and the Fisher information Ic dened as
hc2i  hc  c02i 
Using Eq 29 it follows that
Ic  Z d
2 log P   c
P   c
2 log P   c
which when inserted in Eq 32 leads to Ic  Nc2 In the large-N limit the Cramer-Rao bound
becomes an equality and translates into the following expression for the uncertainty in concentration
sensing at c0
This result is two-fold lower than the BP limit The dierence is that the maximum-likelihood ML
estimate considers only the unbound time intervals as only these contain information about the ligand
concentration
A few comments are in order The exact expectation value for the estimator can easily be derived
from Eq 30 leading to

It follows that the estimator is unbiased ie hcMLi  c0 only in the asymptotic limit of large N  The
results obtained here and in the main text are consistent with this limit From Eq 37 evaluated for

It follows that the exact value for the bound on the variance of the ML estimator is
coincides with c2

consistent with the assumption that Tu  kc0 k implied in the integration carried out in Eq 37
Note that one can also dene the unbiased estimator c

obtains a sharper bound on the variance given by hc

peak value of the likelihood but the mean value we obtain an unbiased estimator with a slightly lower

4 Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound including a prior
Next we consider cells which preserve a memory of previous environmental conditions Specically the
Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound 24 allows us to estimate a lower bound to the variance of the expected
value of an estimator when a prior distribution for such an estimator is known Let us call c the unbiased
estimator of the true concentration c0 Such a parameter is estimated based on a set of measurements 
distributed according to P   c If c is the known prior distribution of the parameter c0 then it can
be shown that
hc2i  hc  c02i

where averaging on the left-hand side is conducted using the prior distribution leading to the reduction

with mean and variance in log-space given by hlogci   and hlogc  2i   respectively In linear

Consequently I is given by

Furthermore Ic follows from Eq 32 where P   c the probability likelihood of observing a sequence
 of N bound and unbound time intervals is given by Eq 29 Equations 29 and 30 lead to the
following expression for Ic

In conclusion the uncertainty in ligand concentration with the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound and a log-
normal prior is given by
hc2i 
exp2  2
N  12  1
In the following we deviate slightly from the derivation found in 5
In this article the prior was
assumed to be centred around the true ligand concentration Here we assume more conservatively that
the prior distribution is centred around the erroneous ML value cML of the concentration obtained from
the previous measurement The variance of the distribution is again given by the standard Cramer-Rao
bound from the ML estimation hc2
0N 6 with c0 the true value for the concentration From
these assumptions it follows that
MLi  c2
hci  expcid20

hc2  hci2i  cid0exp2  1cid1hci2 
where last equality follows from Eq 34 We can now express 2 in terms of known quantities noticing
that for large number of events N  from Eq 50b it follows
exp2  1
N  2 logcid181 
Ncid19 
Inserting this expression for 2 into Eq 49 leads to hc2i  c2
M Le3N
N 1N 1 and therefore to
where c0 in the denominator is the true value of the concentration which diers from cML obtained from
previous measurement by at most a correction proportional to c0N due to Eq 34 so that Eq
52 is correct to leading order for N large a result identical to the one in 5
Eq 52 means that having a prior distribution for N intervals is the same as measuring for 2N
intervals without a prior distribution Hence information is neither lost nor gained This also means
that by using memory in the form of a prior a cell can eectively perform longer and hence more
accurate measurements without being limited by the actual measurement averaging time
42 Gamma-distributed prior
Alternatively assume the prior is given by the Gamma distribution
c 
c1ec
where the parameters  and  are related to the rst and second moment of the distribution

Consequently the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound is given by
hc2i

12
With the same assumptions as done in the previous section mean value and standard deviation of the
prior distribution are set to cML and c2
MLN  respectively see Eqs 50 with cML the ML value for
the concentration obtained in previous measurement Eqs 54a and 54b then imply
  N
In the limit of large N  this leads to relative uncertainty
N 2 
N 1N 2
with again c0 the true value of the concentration cML  c0  c0N  Not surprisingly this is the same
result as obtained in Eq 52 since both the log-normal and the Gamma distribution can be derived
from Gaussian distributed variables The Gamma distribution is the distribution of the sum of squared
normal variables aka2 distribution while the log-normal as the name suggests is the distribution
of the logarithm of a normally distributed variable
5 Maximum-likelihood estimation with ligand rebinding
Endres and Wingreen 6 applied maximum likelihood ML to the problem of estimating the ligand
concentration from a time series of ligand-receptor occupancy but focused on the uncertainty of this
measurement without ligand rebinding ie eectively for very fast diusion For slower diusion one
should consider possible rebinding of a previously bound ligand molecule which makes the instantaneous
rate of binding a functional of the previous binding and unbinding events The binding rate can thus be
written as kc0tt t The rate of unbinding remains k so the ML estimate of concentration still
comes entirely from the durations of the unbound intervals
We quickly review ML estimation of the ligand concentration with ligand rebinding 6 The proba-
bility for a time series to occur given a ligand concentration c0 is
P t t c Yi
pbti tiptiputi ti1pti1
where the probability for a ligand molecule to remain bound from ti to ti is
pbti ti  pbti  ti  ektiti
The probability for a receptor to remain unbound from ti to ti1 includes the eect on the binding
of the changing concentration of ligand p  kc0  ci where ci is the perturbation to the ligand
concentration from previous binding and unbinding events Consequently
puti ti1  ekc0ti1tik Ri ctdt
where we have expressed the ligand concentration as
ctt t  c0  ctt t  c0  ct  ti t  ti
and used the notationRi dt R ti1
The terms can be gathered as before leading to
dt ct  ctt t and ci  cti
P t t c  ekTb  ekc0Tu  kN
  kN
c0  ciek Ri ctdt
Importantly all the cs depend only on the times of events not the value of c0 so dcdc  0
yielding
dc  kTuP Xi
c0  ci
Setting the above derivative to zero yields an implicit equation for the ML estimate of c0
c0  ci
 kTu
where the sum is over all binding events Importantly each ci depends deterministically on all previous
binding and unbinding events For the special case of fast diusion D   and hence ci  0 we
obtain 6 kc0  NTu  1hui where Tu is the total unbound time of the receptor during time T  N
is the total number of bindingunbinding events and hui is the average unbound time interval
How accurate is the concentration estimate Using the Cramer-Rao bound once more we obtain for
the normalised variance
dc2 Ec0
0D d2 lnP 
hPi1  cic02ic0
where we used P from Eq 64 Hence the normalised variance of the ML estimate of the true concen-
tration c0 is the inverse of the number of unbound intervals with additional corrections in the regime of
slow diusion due to perturbations in ligand concentration from previous binding and unbinding events
Equation 67 depends on the average over all trajectories with N binding and unbinding events
Furthermore each perturbation in ligand concentration ci depends on the whole history of binding
and unbinding events making this equation unsolvable However we can estimate the eect of diusion
in the limit of slow binding and unbinding or fast diusion Hence for small cic we can expand to
linear order
to simplify the equation for the uncertainty Equation 68 now contains only a typical perturbation in
ligand concentration hci To estimate this we use the solution of the diusion equation for a single
ligand molecule

with 1 corresponding to an unbound ligand molecule source and 1 corresponding to a bound ligand
molecule sink at t  0 We assume the receptor sits at r  0 at which we wish to evaluate perturbation
Here we provide results for dimensions d  2 and 3
2-dimensional diusion Here we consider d  2 in Eq 69 To further simplify the calculation of the
whole history of binding and unbinding events we assume all binding events are independent ie only
depend on the average rate kc0 and not also on the perturbations We thus obtain the innite series

with the most recent unbinding event occurring at time t  1 and increasing the overall concentration
source and the second most recent binding event occurring at time t  1  2 and decreasing the
overall concentration sink and so on The averages are performed over the probability of a sequence of
K events and then summed in the limit K   to account for an innitely long history
For the special case p  12 so that hui  hbi   and   kc0  k each random number  is
generated with the same distribution    e  In order to evaluate the generic term in the series
of Eq 70 one has rst to evaluate the probability density that a given value TK is obtained for the
i1 i  TK after K draws of the random variable   This probability is given by the K-times
convolution of the distribution   which is
KTK  KeTK T K1
K  1
Then by using this distribution one can evaluate h 1
generic term with K  2 in the sum in Eq 70 leading to
TK i This allows us to obtain an expression for a

Summing all these contributions for K  2 leads to

The contribution for K  1 has to be calculated separately
In fact one has to calculate h1i 
R 
0 dt ett which is the Gamma function n for diverging parameter n  1 To make progress
we realise that the maximal perturbation is the change in concentration due to a single ligand molecule
released into a 2D area of the order of the size of the binding site so cmax  1a2  1

with x  kc0a  1 and hence ln x  0 and   057721 the Euler-Mascheroni constant For very
small x  and the sum can be neglected and the dominant term is the logarithmic part In this limit
it is evident as well that the contribution of the most recent event is much larger than the contribution
from all other events in Eq 73 so that the nal result is

showing the competition between rebinding with rate kc0 and diusion to remove the unbound lig-

The calculation therefore under the simplifying assumption   kc0  k is analogous to the 2-
dimensional case with the only dierence that the average h 32i  R 
0 d e  32 replaces h 1i
Also in this case it can be shown that the contribution from the most recent event is dominant as compared
to that of all other events ie terms in Eq 76 with K  2 Using the distribution in Eq 71 it
is possible to calculate the contributions from all the terms with K  2 in Eq 76 One obtains for a
generic term in the sum
K  Z 
K KTKdTK  32 K  32

which after summation leads to

The ratio between the contribution from terms with K  2 of Eq 78 and this contribution amounts to

which has a stronger dependence on diusion and receptor size compared to sensing in 2D The results
for diusion in 2D and 3D are stated in the main text Specically Eq 12 in the main text is obtained
by using N  Tuhui for the number of bindingunbinding intervals with Tu  1  pT and hui 
kc01 Note that while we estimate hci from the whole history of binding events in our calculation
the individual binding events depend only on the average ligand concentration c0 Hence similar to other
derivations of the uncertainty of sensing by a receptor with ligand rebinding main text Eqs 10 7 and
11 8 we calculate the rst-order correction to the uncertainty due to ligand diusion and rebinding
Note also that only the last unbinding event counts for deriving hci so the exact durations of former
unbound intervals do not matter
6 Uncertainty and decision-making algorithms
Rapid and accurate decisions are ubiquitously made in cells motivating modelling of how this timely
accuracy is achieved Here we follow Siggia and Vergassola to evaluate the decision time and uncertainty
associated with optimal decision-making algorithms 9
In particular we want to make a connection
between decision-making algorithms and ML estimationBP limit
In the case of deciding between two options eg two concentration values c1 and c2 it can be shown
that the Wald algorithm is on average optimal in time Given a xed probability that the wrong
decision is made the Wald algorithm makes the decision in the shortest amount of time on average In
this algorithm two xed thresholds H1 and H2  H1 are given and at each time step the ratio
R  Ldatac1Ldatac2
between the likelihoods conditioned to either option is evaluated Concentration c1c2 is chosen if
R  H1R  H2 while data acquisition continues if H1  R  H2 The algorithm can be mapped to a
diusion process of the variable ln R between two absorbing boundaries corresponding to the thresholds
the values of which are in turn directly connected to the decision-error probability that c1c2 is wrongly
chosen when real value is c2c1 In the diusive approximation for ln R the average absorption time
hTabsi which coincides with the decision time is given by 9

7 Neyman-Pearson lemma
In the Wald algorithm time is not constrained to be xed and this algorithm is optimal in time on average
If time is constrained ie xed sample or data size the optimal test is given by the Neyman-Pearson
NP lemma When choosing between two options c1 reference hypothesis and c2 with a criterion A for
rejecting c1 and a given probability of a decision error
  P Ac1
ie of wrongly choosing c2 when the data are generated with c1 the optimal choice is made by rejecting
c1 in favour of c2 if R  H and choosing c1 otherwise Again R is the likelihood ratio of Eq 82 and
H is an -dependent threshold NP lemma This optimal criterion fulls by denition the constraint of
Eq 84
  P R  Hc1ZxRH
Lxc1dx
which shows also that the threshold value H is determined by  This algorithm is optimal in the sense
that any other algorithm based on a dierent rejection criterion A of the reference hypothesis c1 but with
the same  will have a smaller probability P Ac2 of correctly choosing c2 ie correctly rejecting c1
as compared to the analogous NPs probability P R  Hc2
P R  Hc2ZxRH
Lxc2dx  P Ac2ZxA
Lxc2dx
A on x
In other words for all possible data generated with c2 the NP test will correctly choose c2 more often
than any other test with the same  For this reason this algorithm may be seen as a maximal-likelihood
decision-making algorithm as the likelihood of correctly choosing c2 is maximal So while the Wald
algorithm is optimal in time on average for a xed time the NP algorithm leads to a maximum likelihood
of the correct decision
8 Decision-making algorithms vs Berg-Purcell limit
Berg and Purcell BP were the rst to derive an estimate for the uncertainty of a measurement of ligand
concentration in a xed time T by a small detecting device eg a cell Here we consider their model as
applied to a single receptor As discussed their estimate was later improved by the maximum-likelihood
ML estimate showing that the uncertainty is actually smaller by a factor two because only unbound
intervals carry information about the external concentration 6 Estimates for the uncertainty refer to
concentration measurements and cannot directly be compared to decision making between two values
However one can still assume that in the BP and ML estimates dierent concentrations c1 and c2
can be told apart if phc2i  c2  c1 and that assuming either c1 or c2 as the true value a decision
error occurs if a measurement returns a value outside one standard deviation from the true value With
these choices for the thresholds one accounts for large uctuations around the true value which may lead
to wrongly deciding on the other of two possible options for the true value We are now in a position
in which we can attempt to compare BP and ML estimates with the Wald and NP algorithms Setting
the decision error  of the Wald and NP algorithms equal to the decision error from both the BP and
ML estimates introduced above one obtains minimum value c2  c1 for xed value c1 so that a decision
between c2 and c1 can be made with error  This value can in turn be used as a denition of the
uncertainty in decision making and compared to the BP and ML estimates
Specically for a given value of T for the Wald algorithm one can use Eq 83 and for given c1 derive
the corresponding value of c2 that can be distinguished in time T with decision error   K with
x  K the absorbing boundaries for the symmetric case Using this approach we can plot c2  c12
of the Wald algorithm as a function of T and hence indirectly compare to the uncertainties from BP
and ML Fig 5 A similar procedure allows us to extract c2  c12 for the xed-time Neyman-Pearson
lemma which is also shown in Fig 5
