Four classical laws of black hole thermodynamics are extended from exte-
rior event horizon to interior Cauchy horizon Especially the rst law
of classical thermodynamics for Kerr-Newman black hole KNBH is gen-
eralized to those in quantum form Then ve quantum conservation laws
on the KNBH evaporation eect are derived in virtue of thermodynamical
equilibrium conditions As a by-product Bekenstein-Hawkings relation
S  A4 is exactly recovered

Due to the celebrated works of Hawking 1 and Bekenstein 2 black holes are
demonstrated to be thermodynamic objects endowed with a temperature and an en-
tropy This put the rst laws of black hole thermodynamics on a solid fundament 3

origin of black hole thermodynamics however the exact source and mechanism of the
Benkenstein-Hawking entropy remain unclear 8
In this paper we assume that the whole space-time of a rotating charged black
hole is described by Kerr-Newman metric and base our discussion on a sourceless
charged massive scalar eld on Kerr-Newman black hole KNBH background in the
non-extreme case 0    M 2  a2  e2  M We propose that there should exist
an inner thermal radiation on the internal horizon and that a Kerr-Newman black hole
have a pair of entropy accompanied by a pair of temperature Under this assumption
we can extend Bardeen-Carter-Hawkings four laws of black hole thermodynamics on
exterior horizon to those on internal horizon We also suggest a pair of quantum rst
laws of thermodynamics Then quantum conservation laws on black hole radiation
process are derived from the point of view of thermodynamical equilibrium 9 Finally
the relation between classical entropy and quantum entropy of black hole is briey
discussed

KNBH Background
In the Boyer-Lindquist coordinates Kerr-Newman metric is given by 1011

In the KNBH geometry a complex scalar eld  with mass  and charge q satises
the following covariant Klein-Gordon equation KGE 1012

The wave function  of the above equation has a solution of variables separable

The general solutions to the angular equation of Eq3 are ordinary spheroidal
angular wave functions 13 with spin-weight s  0 while the radial equation of Eq4
can be reduced to the following generalized spin-weighted spheroidal wave equation

Introducing w  B  A2 for simplicity and making substitution Rr

Eq6 has two regular singular points r  r whose indices are   02iw and

where functions f1 f2 are rst solutions to Eq6 while g1 g2 being linear independent
second ones to it They are four sets of orthonormal generalized spheroidal wave
functions being regular at points r r respectively We choose such an eigenvalue 
that makes Fr nite at r  r respectively namely functions f1 f2 and g1 g2 are
regular over their corresponding regions
The physical domain for radial coordinate r is 0  0 r  r r r
with region 0 22  22 2  2 for quadratic energy 2 We can extend
simultaneously both intervals on real axes for coordinate and that for energy to cor-
responding whole complex planes including real axes   The extreme case
  0 and special cases   2 as well as    need to be carefully dealt with
but we dont discuss it here
2 Hawking Radiation External or Internal
The exterior horizon and interior horizon denoted by H are located at points
r  M   We shall consider a wave outgoing from horizon H over intervals
r  r  r and r  r  
According to the method of Damour and Runis 15 a correct outgoing wave
out  outt r   is an adequate superposition of functions out
rr and out
out  Cr  rout
rr  r  rout
rre2w
where x is conventional unit step function with the outgoing wave components
rr and out
rr being given by
rrt r    c1r  riwr  riwf 
wwk rS
m0ka eimt
rrt r    c2r  riwr  riwg
wwk rS
m0ka eimt
here regular function f 
wwk r  f1 is the rst solution to the generalized spheroidal
radial wave equation 1214 and regular function g
wwk r  g1 is the second
one to the same equation while S
m0ka  is an ordinary spheroidal angular wave
function 13 These functions can be orthonormalized to constitute their corresponding
orthogonal complete functions 121314
In addition scalar wave function  has
asymptotic behaviors of plane waves at innity

In fact components out
rr and out
rr have asymptotic behaviors when r  r

Clearly the outgoing wave out
r  r  r but it can be analytically continued to an outgoing wave out
rr cant be directly extended from r  r   to
rr that inside
event horizon H by the lower half complex r-plane around unit circle r  r  i0

By this analytical treatment we have
rrt r    c2r  riwr  riwf

here function f 
wwk r can be analytically continued to be function g

As a dierence factor r  r2iw emerges between functions F 
riwr  riwf1 and G
rr by a factor e2w thus we can derive a relation

Using the method of Damour-Runis it is easy to obtain an external thermal
radiation spectrum 15

Similarly due to symmetry between exterior horizon and interior horizon we can
also establish an internal black body spectrum

for a right outgoing wave out  outt r   from horizon H which is similar to
the above-head left outgoing wave out

Now we have made analytical extension for out by the upper half complex r-plane

3 Generalized First Laws of Black Hole Thermodynamics Classical
and Quantum
It is convenient to introduce formally the following notations
Reduced horizon area  A  r2
Surface gravity    rM
Electric potential    er
  a2 Horizon  r  M  
Angular velocity    a
Frequency    m  q
We can derive algebraically the following generalized rst laws of classical and
quantum black hole thermodynamics in both integral and dierential forms on exterior
horizon H as well as on interior horizon H  see Appendix

forms 316
dA  dJ  de
M  A  2J  e
b Generalized rst laws of quantum thermodynamics in integral and dierential
forms 917
  2w  m  q
d  2dw  dm  dq
Relations 20 21 demonstrate that electro-magnetic energy e is an interaction
energy gauge term while term A and term J being self energy terms
4 Quantum Conservation Laws
Let us consider a complex scalar eld  in thermal equilibrium with a Kerr-Newman
black hole at a pair of local temperature T  2 In thermal equilibrium radiation
process surface gravity  angular velocity and electrical potential can be considered
to undertake little change In virtue of conditions that thermodynamical equilibrium
could exist on horizons
0  0 0  0 0  0
combining dierential relations Eq20 with Eq23 we can deduce ve quantum
conservation laws for energy angular momentum charge and entropy respectively
dM  nd Energy
dJ  ndm Angular Momentum
de  ndq Charge
dA  ndw Entropy
Here n is an integral multiplier From integral relations 21 and 22 we can also
obtain a special quantum state nm  J n  M2 nq  e2 nw  A4
Eqs24-27 indicate that a Kerr-Newman black hole has discrete increment of en-
ergy angular momentum charge and entropy When a KNBH is in dynamical equi-
librium with a scalar eld it radiates the same quantity of quanta as that it absorbs
Thus the total quantities of energy charge entropy and angular momentum of the
whole system being consisted of black hole and scalar eld quanta remain unchanged
in this thermodynamical equilibrium radiation process 9
5 Entropy Classical and Quantum
In fact Eq27 is a pair of generalized second thermodynamic laws in quantum
form By integrating this equation we obtain quantum black hole entropy
4A  C
As Bekenstein-Hawkings classical entropy 12 is S  A4  A quantum en-
tropy nw are equivalent to the reduced entropy S  S4 so we have Bekenstein-
Hawking relations Choose constant C  0
S  nw  A4
Eqs28 29 demonstrate that Bekenstein-Hawking classical entropy origins statis-
tically from quantum entropy of quantized eld that is the classical entropy of black
hole is equal to quantum entropy of eld 9
6 Spectrum Continued or Discrete
Quantum numbers of entropy nw must be integers as quantities A B  correspond
to angular momentum msa respectively when mass   0 It is suggested that
the quantum entropy nw be discrete numbers namely be integers The thermal spec-
trum hNi for bound states are discrete spectrum while the spectrum for scattering
states being continual ones
7 Temperature Positive or Negative
From thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation
hNi 
e4w  1
  m  q
we can deduce that a KNBH has a pair of local temperature T  2  T
on horizons H
If we accept the temperature interpretation of surface gravity   r2
  a2
then temperature T is positive while T being negative The denition of negative
temperature has no contradict with black hole having negative specic heat
8 Generalized Four Thermodynamical Laws
We give the chief points of four generalized laws of black hole thermodynamics as
follows
The Zeroth Law The surface gravity  of a stationary black hole at equilibrium
are two constants on the entire surface of its corresponding horizons H
The First Law In an isolated system including black holes the total energy of the
system is conserved
The Second Law The total entropy ST  SBH SM never decreases in any physical
process where SM is the total entropy of ordinary matter outside black holes ST  0
The Third Law It is impossible by any physical process to reduce  to zero by
a nite sequence of operations However this can be violated by quantum vacuum
uctuations Quantum evaporation eect can make a KNBH undertake a second order
phase transition 18 from the non-extreme case M 2 6 a2  e2 to the extreme case
M 2  a2  e2
Quantum Conservation Laws In a thermal equilibrium process of black hole radi-
ation the total energy total charge total angular momentum and total entropy of the
whole system are conserved
To summarize many results on the exterior horizon are generalized to similar ones
on the inner horizon We suggest that there should exist an interior radiation on the
Cauchy horizon provided that the whole spacetime is described by the Kerr-Newman
line element This provides a rather good interpretation of the origin of black hole
classical entropy arising statistically from quantum entropy of eld quanta Thus if a
KNBH really has two pairs of temperature and entropy then how do we interpret them
 There exists a proposal that a KNBH be a two-energy levels system endowed with
a pair of local temperature on the horizons As far as existed theories are concerned
it seems to have no reason to exclude a negative temperature T
