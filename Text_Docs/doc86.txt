AbstractOur aim is to extract information about literary
characters in unstructured texts We employ natural language
processing and reasoning on domain ontologies The rst task is
to identify the main characters and the parts of the story where
these characters are described or act We illustrate the system in
a scenario in the folktale domain The system relies on a folktale
ontology that we have developed based on Propps model for
folktales morphology

I INTRODUCTION
Recognising literary characters in various narrative texts
is challenging both from the literary and technical perspec-
tive From the literary viewpoint the meaning of the term
character leaves space to various interpretations From the
technical perspective literary texts contain a lot of data about
emotions social life or inner life of the characters while they
are very thin on technical straight-forward messages To infer
the character type from literary texts might pose problems even
to the human readers 4
Interactions between literary characters contain rich social
networks Extracting these social networks from narrative text
has gained much attention 13 in different domains such as
literary ction 6 screenplays 1 or novels 9 2
Our aim is to correctly determine the relationships of a
character in a tale and to nd its role upon the development
of the story In line with 16 the rst task is to identify
the parts of the story where that character is involved Our
approach relies on interleaving natural language processing
and ontology-based reasoning We enact our method in the
folktale domain
Information extraction systems usually have three compo-
nents responsible for named entity recognition co-reference
resolution and relationship extraction These modules are
integrated in a pipeline in a layered manner given that each
task will use information provided by the previous neighbor
Natural language processing has been applied in the domain
of folktales 14 8 Formal models for folktales have been
proposed in 12 15 Character identication in folktales
have been approached in 17 19
The remaining of the paper is organized as follows Sec-
tion II presents the ontology that we developed for modeling

II ENGINEERING THE FOLKTALE ONTOLOGY
To support reasoning in the folktale domain we developed
an ontology used to extract knowledge regarding characters
We assume the reader is familiarised with the syntax of
Description Logic DL For a detailed explanation about
families of description logics the reader is referred to 3
To support character identication and reasoning on these
characters we need structured domain knowledge Hence we
developed an ontology for the folktale domain as shown in
Fig 3 Our folktale ontology formalizes knowledge from
three sources 1 the folktale morphology as described by the
Propp model 15 2 various entities specic to folktales ie
animals witch dragons and 3 common family relations ie
child ancee groom In the following these three knowledge
sources are detailed
a Folktale morphology Firstly we rely on the Propps
model 15 of the folktale domain In the Propps model the
story broke down into several sections Propp demonstrated
that the sequence of sections appears in the same chronological
order in Russian folktales Propp identied a set of character
types that appear in most of the folktales see Table I
The corresponding formalization in Description Logic ap-
pears in Fig 1 where the characters are divided in nine types

Fig 2 Common entities in the folktale domain
axiom 1 In axiom 2 a false hero is a hero who is also
a villain Axiom 3 divides the characters into negative and
positive ones Note that positive and negative characters are
not disjoint as for instance the concept Prisoner belongs to
both sets
b Folktale main entities Secondly the common entities
appearing in folktales were formalized in Fig 2 The axioms
depict the animals axiom 21 witches or enchantresses which
are women with a single social status axioms 22 and 23
and supernatural characters like Giant in axiom 24 Specic
characters like Goldsmith or King and various objects ie
oven are also modeled A prince is dened in axiom 28 as a
son that have a parent either a king or a queen Similarly the
princess is a daughter with at least on parent of type king or
queen axiom 30
c Family relationships in folktale Fig 4 lists part of the
family relationships adapted to reason in the folktale domain
A signicant part of these relationships are correlated with the
recurrent theme of the main character who is nding his bride
or ancee
To facilitate reasoning on the ontology we allow several
extensions of the ALC version of description logics 3 Using
role inheritance we can specify that the role hasFather is more
specic than the role hasParent Hence if we nd in the folk-
tale that a character has a father the system deduces based on
role inheritance that the character has also a parent Similarly
inverse roles like hasChild and hasParent are used to infer
new knowledge based on the partial knowledge extracted by
natural language processing If we identify that two individuals
are related by the role hasChild the system deduces that those
individuals are also related by the role hasParent The domain
restriction species that only persons can have brothers The
range restriction constraints the range of the role hasGender
to the concept Gender

Fig 5 The System Architecture
III SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Extracting knowledge about characters is obtained by inter-
leaving natural language processing NLP and reasoning on
ontologies The NLP component is based on GATE text engi-
neering tool 5 while reasoning in DL on the OWLAPI 10
as depicted by the architecture in Fig 5
Firstly the folktale ontology is processed using OWLAPI to
generate classes of characters from the ontology into GATE
The folktale corpus is analysed aiming to populate the ontol-
ogy and to annotate each folktale with the identied named
entities In parallel to the annotation process the Stanford
parser creates the coreference information les The task is
challenging as even a human might have a problem in decoref-
erencing some of the sentences as example 1 illustrates
Example 1 The Smiths went to visit the Robertsons After
that they stayed home watching tv where they might be
tied to the Smiths or the Robertsons or to both of the families
For de-coreferencing the following pipeline was designed
left part of Fig 5 The tokenizer groups all the letters into
words Next the sentence splitter Ssplit groups the sequence
of tokens obtained in the previous step into sentences The
part of speech POS annotation labels all the tokens from
a sentence with their POS tags Lemma annotation generates
the word lemmas for all the tokens in the corpus The next
step is to apply named entity recognition NER so that the
numerical and temporal entities are recognized This is done
using a conditional random elds CRF sequence taggers
trained on various corpora The parse function provides a full
syntactic analysis for each sentence in the corpora Finally
the coreference chain annotation Dcoref obtains both the
pronominal and nominal coreference resolution After coref-
erence resolution the stories are updated with the coreference
information
The Reverb information extraction tool 7 is used to
generate triplets containing the following structure cid104nominal
phrase verb phrase nominal phrasecid105 For the sentence Good
heavens said the girl no strawberries grow in winter the
output of Reverb is exemplied in Table III In order to obtain
the triplets each sentence has to be POS-tagged and NP-
chunked
IV INTERLEAVING NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
WITH REASONING ON ONTOLOGIES
This section details three algorithms used to identify knowl-
edge about characters Algorithm 1 identies characters in the
folktale Algorithm 3 is used for anaphora resolution of the
named entities recognized as characters Algorithm 2 extracts
knowledge about characters from the de-coreferences The
execution ow of this pipeline is presented in Fig 6
Natural
language processing is enacted to populate the
folktale ontology The extraction Algorithm 1 is performed
repetitively on a document each time using the newly pop-
ulated ontology le In this way the algorithm interleaves
reasoning on ontology with natural language processing based
on Japes rules 18 The rst step is to apply the Jape rules
JN on the folktale corpus aiming to identify all the denite
and indenite nominal phrases Given that the characters are
nominal phrases this rst step returns all the information
needed plus some extra phrases that have to be ltered out
Next the Jape rules JC are enacted to select candidate char-
acters from the set of nominal phrases previously identied
For each character found a set of rules JR is used to match
the character against a concept in the ontology

Fig 6 Main execution phases
The decoreferencing algorithm Alg 2 uses as input the
processing pipeline and the folktale corpus The basic pro-
cessing steps needed are the following tokenize ssplit pos
lemma ner parse dcoref The decoreferencing algorithm is
run on all stories at once but it generates different output le
for each story represented by the lename In the rst step the
Stanford parser applies the execution pipeline on the corpora
of folktales For each resulted le the algorithm searches for
coreference groups In order to be able to return the modied
text the original text has to be stored in the returning argument
of the algorithm For each coreference group found rstly
the referenced word has to be processed and kept
variable and then each coreferenced word found belonging
to the group has to be replaced in the original text with the
referenced variable In the end the decoreferenced text for
each corpus le is obtained
Algorithm 3 takes as input the result of algorithms 1 and
alg 2 The set of characters is used as the input while the
decoreferenced texts are used as an environment from which
the algorithm extracts the perspective For each character in the
set of characters resulted from the extraction algorithm alg 1
each line that resulted from reverb execution is processed
From each line the sentence is extracted based on the output
Algorithm 3 Finding characters perspective
format of the Reverb service presented in Table III If the
character from the character set is mentioned in the sentence
then the sentence is appended to the output variable These
columns are combined in a triplet and it is checked to see
whether the current character appears is present in this triplet
In this case the triplet is appended to the output variable This
algorithms score is represented by a subunitary number that
represents the condence that the extraction was correct
V EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
A Running scenario
The system was tested against seven stories Table V This
section illustrates the results of this pipeline for the secondary
character Henry from the story The frog king The fragment
on which the algorithms were applied is listed in Example 2
Example 2 Then they went to sleep and next morning when
the sun awoke them a carriage came driving up with eight
white horses which had white ostrich feathers on their heads
and were harnessed with golden chains and behind stood the
young kings servant Faithful Henry Faithful Henry had been
so unhappy when his master was changed into a frog that
he had caused three iron bands to be laid round his heart
lest it should burst with grief and sadness The carriage was
to conduct the young king into his kingdom Faithful Henry
helped them both in and placed himself behind again and
was full of joy because of this deliverance And when they
had driven a part of the way the kings son heard a cracking
behind him as if something had broken So he turned round
TABLE IV
ELICITING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HENRY
Character Henry
Henry master was changed into a frog
Henry had caused three iron bands
faithful Henry helped bands
bands placed Henry
Henry was full of joy
the bands were springing from the heart of faithful Henry
and cried Henry the carriage is breaking No master it
is not the carriage It is a band from my heart which was put
there in my great pain when you were a frog and imprisoned
in the well Again and once again while they were on their
way something cracked and each time the kings son thought
the carriage was breaking but it was only the bands which
were springing from the heart of Faithful Henry because his
master was set free and was happy
The method has two kind of results - one for the long
version and one for the short version Firstly the results for
the short version are listed in Table IV Note that the output
text is the decoreferenced one - this is the reason why the
character might talk about itself in third person Because of the
de-coreferenced version of the stories part of text might not be
correct from the human reader perspective But it is the easiest
way to understand the context of a character Otherwise it
would be hard to see that when the text says his master
that his refers to Henry as Example 3 bears out
Example 3 1 Then companion went
to sleep and next
morning when the sun awoke companion a band came driving
up with eight white horses which had white ostrich feathers
on companion heads and were harnessed with golden chains
and behind stood the young kings servant faithful Henry
2 Faithful Henry had been so unhappy when henry master
was changed into a frog that Henry had caused three iron
bands to be laid round henry heart lest heart should burst
with grief and sadness
3 Faithful Henry helped bands both in and placed Henry
behind again and was full of joy because of this deliverance
4 Again and once again while you were on you way
something cracked and each time the kings son thought the
band was breaking  but it was only the bands which were
springing from the heart of faithful Henry because Henry
master was set free and was happy
There are some cases in which there will be no result for a
character Example 4 Given that the character was extracted
from the original le by using Algorithm 1 there is a certainty
that the character exists in the story
Example 4 When trying to search for the perspective of
character waiting-maid in the story Faithful John the
application will not be able to nd any solution In the un-
modied text the son character is introduced in the following
way She took him by the hand and led him upstairs for she
was the waiting-maid

Average
Accuracy
This happens because when the anaphoric decoreference is
run Algorithm 2 the le is changed in the following way
Girl took oh by the hand and led oh upstairs  for girl was the
girl  The change happened because the decoreferencing tool
interpreted the waiting-maid as being tied up to the word
she and which is tied to the girl from the following
phrase Then said the girl  the princess must see these 
girl has such great pleasure in golden things  that girl will
buy all you have   In this way this characters part will
be attributed to the girl which is the main character of
the story This situation in which the story is talking about a
general character but only after the main events the character
is nally revealed is called cataphora 11
B Accuracy of the method
The accuracy of our method is inuenced by 1 accuracy
of character identication 2 accuracy of identifying co-
references 3 accuracy of Reverb when extracting triplets the
condence indicator Each of this services has an accuracy
error that will be propagated from one component to another
We performed various tests on the corpus used for character
identication and we obtained an average accuracy of 70
Table V When calculating the accuracy 20 characters were
taken into consideration meaning that for each story about
3 characters were chosen These characters were manually
selected from the set of characters output by the character
extraction system presented in 17 19 The characters were
selected by choosing 2 main characters and a secondary
character for each story
The testing was performed on seven different stories and
for each story a set of main characters was chosen The
obtained overall accuracy is 74 having an overall precision
of 90 and a recall of 60 The results are presented in
Fig 7 Figure 8 depicts the distribution of precision recall and
accuracy over the stories The values were calculated using the
following formulas
precision 
recall 
accuracy 
tpf ptnf n
where tp means true positive and represents the number
of sentences that are found both in the manually annotated
set and the test set tn means true negative and represents the
number of sentences that are neither in the manually annotated
recall of 72 These scores do not inuence directly the
algorithms performance but they have an effect on the number
of characters for which the algorithm will try to nd the roles
they have on the development of the story Together all these
scores combined give the performance scores of the characters
perspective in texts
The current version does not extract information about the
characters roles The information extracted consists of the
character identication that is presented in 17 19 and
the story involving the character The story can be presented
in a standardized version
VI DISCUSSION
We can enact our solution in other domains instead of folk-
tales We exemplify he following three domains a software
requirements b marketing and c medical domain
Consider the domain of software requirements where these
requirements are written in natural language Our system will
support the identication of various actors appearing in the
requirements document First one needs to replace the folktale
ontology with a requirement ontology that provides knowledge
on use cases actors their roles etc The same pipeline will
be used to 1 identify main actors admin various users etc
and 2 extract knowledge about various actions these actors
are supposed to perform
Another domain that could benet from the same pipeline of
execution would be the marketing domain Consider a dataset
of product reviews or accommodation places in the tourism
domain 20 The system would extract only the sentences
that reference the mentioned item By having access to all
the sentences of interest further analysis is facilitated without
having to process the entire text
Similar extraction systems have been proposed for the med-
ical domain to extract information from clinical narratives In
this line the MedEx system 21 aims to extract the medication
information from clinical narratives Similarly there is also the
OpenClinical system for assisting health care providers
In our approach the extraction algorithm part is separated
from the perspective searching part Therefore any ontology
and any document can be used in order to nd the characters
or objects perspective in the document
We tested our method only on seven stories With a com-
plexity of On3 in sentence length of syntactic parsing our
syntactic based on Stanford parser might be too slow for large
corpus as the one of 15099 narratives analysed in 4
VII CONCLUSIONS
Our method is able to extract knowledge on various char-
acters Our current accuracy for information extraction in
the folktale domain is 74 The experimental results were
obtained for seven stories in the folktale domain The precision
score is above 90 With an overall recall of only 60
there are high chances that not all the information regarding
a product was extracted
The developed algorithms aggregate three different services
the named entity recognition was implemented by

set nor in the test set f p means false positive and represents
the number of sentences that are in the test set and not in
the manually annotated set and f n means false negative and
represents the number of sentences that are in the manually
annotated set but not in the test set In the folktale context
the tp represents the number of sentences that belong to the
characters perspective all those sentences that involve the
character in any way
The average F-score for the Stanford-CoreNLP of 595
inuences greatly the performance of the algorithm as the
characters perspective cannot be extracted given that
character is not seen as being part of the sentence The
accuracy can be improved if a better decoreferencing tool
will be used Other coreference tools are For the anaphoric
decoreference there are several other tools BART JAVARAP
GuiTar and ARKref but from all the Stanford-CoreNLP has
be highest accuracy percentage
There is ongoing research in the coreference resolution
domain When calculating the performance scores the ex-
traction of the correct sentence was considered and not on
the correctness of the extracted sentence Even though the
right sentence was extracted the information in the sentence
will be according to the coreference resolution result Hence
an error might be observed when reviewing the structure of
the sentences The algorithms performance is also inuenced
by the scores obtained by the Reverb tool Also the named
entity recognition has an average precision of 79 and a

characters was integrated in order to link two noun phrases
