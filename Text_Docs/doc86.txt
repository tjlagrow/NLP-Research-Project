ABSTRACT
We investigate the environmental dependence of star formation and the morphol-
ogy of galaxies in the local universe based on a volume-limited sample constructed
from the data of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey The sample galaxies 19714 in total
are restricted to the redshift range of 0030  z  0065 and the magnitude range of

r  2 We investigate correlations between star formation morphology lumi-
nosity local density and richness of galaxy systems First we focus on how galaxy
properties change with local density Galaxies in dense environment are found to have
suppressed star formation rates and early morphological types compared with those
in the eld Star formation and morphology show a break at the critical local den-
sity of log crit  04 galaxies h 2
75 Mpc2 which is in agreement with previous studies
However the break can be seen only for faint galaxies M

and bright galaxies Mr  M 
r  1 show no break Thus galaxies of dierent lumi-
nosities are found to show dierent environmental dependencies Next we examine
dependencies on richness of galaxy systems Median properties of galaxies residing in
systems with   200 km s1 show no dependence on system richness and most of
the galaxies in those systems are non-star-forming early-type galaxies Star formation
activities of galaxies are dierent from those of eld galaxies even in systems as poor as
  100 km s1 This result suggests that environmental mechanisms that are eective
only in rich systems such as ram-pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment have
not played a major role in transforming galaxies into red early-type galaxies Stran-
gulation and interactions between galaxiesm however remain candidates of the driver
of the environmental dependence In the dense environment in the local universe the

slow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent but the transformation of
bright galaxies is not clearly visible We suggest that the evolution of bright galaxies is
not strongly related to galaxy system such as groups and clusters while the evolution
of faint galaxies is likely to be closely connected to galaxy system

INTRODUCTION
It is widely known that galaxy properties such as morphology and the rate of star formation
depend on environment For instance we know that red early-type galaxies dominate galaxy
clusters whereas blue late-type galaxies preferentially reside in the eld region eg Dressler 1980
Whitmore Gilmore  Jones 1993 Why do galaxy properties vary depending on environment
in which they are located How is such a relation established in galaxy evolution Although
considerable eort has been devoted to answer these questions no clear conclusion has been reached
as yet
Intensive studies of galaxy clusters have demonstrated a clear connection between galaxy prop-
erties and environment Dressler 1980 Whitmore Gilmore  Jones 1993 Balogh et al 1997 1998
Hashimoto Oemler Lin  Tucker 1998 Balogh et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 Couch et al
2001 Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 Blanton et al 2003a with possible evolution Butcher
 Oemler 1984 Couch  Sharples 1987 Dressler et al 1997 Andreon 1998 Fasano et al 2000
Goto et al 2003a 2004 Lewis et al 2002 and Gomez et al 2003 statistically analyzed the star
formation rates SFRs of galaxies using large-survey data which became available in recent years
They analyzed a wide range of environment ie from the sparse eld to the dense cluster cores
and showed that star formation is suppressed beyond the virial radius out to  2Rvir of clusters
with the break at the critical density of   1 galaxies Mpc2 Goto et al 2003b investigated
galaxy morphology using the same sample as Gomez et al 2003 and found that morphology also
breaks at the same density found for star formation Treu et al 2003 presented the morphology-
density relation in Cl0024 z  04 on the basis of 39 pointings of the WFPC2 on the Hubble Space
Telescope They suggested that the morphology-density relation shows no signicant evolution in
low density regions With the wide-eld camera Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope Miyazaki
et al 2002 Kodama et al 2001 identied galaxy groups surrounding the A851 cluster z  041
They found a break in galaxy color at a density typical of galaxy groups They concluded that star
formation is already suppressed in such groups and that most of the red galaxies may have stopped
forming stars before they enter the cluster core
It had been believed that cluster environment
plays a critical role in galaxy evolution but Kodama et al 2001 illustrated the importance of
group environment
Although galaxy groups have recieved less attention than clusters some hints of environmental
 3 
dependence in groups have been reported Postman  Geller 1984 found that the morphology-
density relation Dressler 1980 holds in groups suggesting the existence of the morphology-density
relation over a wide range of local density Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998 and Tran Simard
Zabludo  Mulchaey 2001 studied X-ray selected groups Both studies suggested that the
properties of galaxies dier from those of eld galaxies in the sense that more red early-type galaxies
are found in groups Domnguez et al 2002 analyzed morphology in groups in the 2dF redshift
survey Merchan  Zandivarez 2002 nding that in massive groups Mvirial  10135M the
fraction of low SFR galaxies depends on local density and group-centric radius On the other hand
no signicant dependence was found in less massive groups Martnez et al 2002 investigated
SFRs in galaxy groups and found a correlation between the relative fraction of star forming galaxies
and the mass of the parent group
Several physical mechanisms are expected to drive the environmental dependence of galaxy
properties Each mechanism has specic environment in which it works most eectively For
example ram-pressure stripping Gunn  Gott 1972 Abadi Moore  Bower 1999 Quilis Moore
 Bower 2000 is eective in the cores of rich clusters and low-velocity galaxy-galaxy interactions
eg Mihos  Hernquist 1994 1996 Mihos 2003 between galaxies are eective in groups We
roughly categorize the suggested mechanisms into two classes mechanisms that are especially
eective in rich clusters and those that are eective in other environments The former class
includes for example ram-pressure stripping harassment Moore et al 1996a Fujita 1998 Moore
Lake Quinn  Stadel 1999 and interaction with cluster potential Byrd  Valtonen 1990 The
latter class includes low-velocity encounters mergers and strangulation which is often referred to in
the literature as suocation strangulation or halo gas stripping Larson Tinsley  Caldwell 1980
Balogh Navarro  Morris 2000 Diaferio et al 2001 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 Therefore
the dependence of star formation and morphology on the richness of galaxy systems is key to
understanding the underlying physical mechanisms
r 1  Mr  M 
In this paper we present a detailed study of the environmental dependence of galaxy properties
on the basis of data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS A unique feature of this paper is that
we investigate galaxies down to M 
r  2 which is deeper by  1 mag than previous volume-limited
studies Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 Balogh et al 2004 The environmental dependence of
faint galaxies M 
r 2 is addressed in particular in detail Another point of emphasis
is our statistical analysis of star formation and galactic morphology from two dierent points of
view First we focus on the density-dened environment and examine relationships between galaxy
properties and environment We adopt a denition of density similar to that used in previous studies
eg Gomez et al 2003 Balogh et al 2004 Second we examine relationships between galaxy
properties and richness of galaxy systems such as groups and clusters to put constraints on the
proposed mechanisms In 2 we describe the denition of our sample The dependencies of galaxy
properties on density-dened environment are investigated in 3 The star formationdensity and
morphology-density relations are also examined in that section We focus on the richness of galaxy
systems in 4 and discuss the implications of our ndings in 5 Finally our conclusions are
 4 
summarized in 6
In the course of this work we have found similar independent work by Balogh et al 2004
They investigated the environmental dependence of star formation of galaxies in the local universe
and suggested that the dependence is the product of mechanisms such as galaxy-galaxy interactions
that took place at high redshift The reader is referred to the paper for a detailed discussion
Throughout this paper we assume a at universe of M  03   07 and H0  75 km s1 Mpc1
2 SAMPLE DEFINITION
We use the data from the SDSS York et al 2000 Stoughton et al 2002 Abazajian et al 2003
The plan of the SDSS is to observe an unprecedented number of objects both photometrically and
spectroscopically in one quarter of the sky The imaging survey of the SDSS is made in ve optical
bands u g r i and z Fukugita et al 1996 Hogg Finkbeiner Schlegel  Gunn 2001 Smith et
al 2002 The reader is referred to Gunn et al 1998 for details regarding the SDSS camera
system and to Pier et al 2003 for the astrometric calibration The spectroscopic part of the
SDSS observes essentially all galaxies brighter than r  1777 selected from the imaging survey
Main Galaxy Sample Strauss et al 2002 With a pair of double ber-fed spectrographs 640
spectra are obtained with a 45 minutes exposure covering from 3800A to 9200A with a resolution
of   2000 Each ber subtends 3 on the sky Due to the mechanical constraints of the
spectrograph a ber cannot be located closer than 55 to the nearby ber which would otherwise
result in ber collision A tiling algorithm has been developed to reduce the number of objects
that are not fed bers as a result of ber collision Blanton et al 2003b The completeness of the
spectroscopic survey is probably somewhere between 90 and 95
We construct a volume-limited sample based on the SDSS data All the photometric data
of our sample are extracted from the rst data release catalog DR1 Abazajian et al 2003 We
gather spectral data1 from the Data Archive Server and cross-match them with photometric objects
in DR1 to construct a full catalog We have not used the spectroscopic objects in DR1 because the
sky coverage of the DR1 spectroscopic data is very patchy and does not cover the entire region of
the photometric data The patchy distribution is a signicant disadvantage in the calculation of
galaxy density see 3 As a check we cross-matched the objects in our catalog that fall in the
DR1 spectroscopic region with DR1 spectroscopic objects and nding that  996 of the objects
were matched within a 3 separation Note that the spectroscopic data of DR1 are constructed
from data dierent from those we use eg from a dierent version of the pipeline software used
Although there are actually some objects in DR1 that are not matched with our objects they
comprise less than 04 of the total Thus the missing objects cause no signicant damage to
the overall completeness of our sample It is worth noting that the missing objects are not biased
1All the spectral data analyzed here are spRerun 22
 5 
toward any particular type of galaxy That is there are no such trends as that the missing galaxies
tend to be star-forming galaxies or the missing galaxies tend to be early-type galaxies
We select galaxies in the redshift range of 0030  z  0065 and the magnitude range
of Mr  194 which corresponds to Mr  M 
r  2 Blanton et al 2001 for our cosmology
r  214 and construct the volume-limited sample as illustrated in Figure 1 Most of the
volume-limited samples in previous studies are dened as 005  z  01 and Mr  M 
r  1 We
set the redshift cuts lower than those of the previous work in order to study fainter galaxies at the
cost of reducing the number of sample galaxies
All the magnitudes in the SDSS are asinh magnitudes Lupton Gunn  Szalay 1999 Since
the dierence between asinh magnitudes and conventional logarithmic magnitudes is negligible
in our sample we apply no conversion and treat asinh magnitudes as standard AB magnitudes
Fukugita et al 1996 Galactic extinction is corrected for each band Schlegel Finkbeiner 
Davis 1998 A K-correction is applied to all magnitudes using the code by Blanton et al 2003c
v1 16 The estimated values of the k-correction are small eg mr  005 and are in agreement
with those calculated using Fukugita Shimasaku  Ichikawa 1995 Whether or not we apply
the k-correction does not change our results Also note that the errors in the photometry and the
k-correction have no eect on our results
In summary our volume-limited sample contains 19 714 objects brighter than M 
r 2  194
over the redshift range of 0030  z  0065
3 DEPENDENCE ON LOCAL DENSITY
In this section we examine the dependence of star formation and morphology on density-
dened environment We characterize environment by a surface galaxy density dened in the next
subsection Statistical analyses of density dependencies have been performed by several authors
eg Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 Goto et al 2003b Balogh et al 2004 but their samples
are restricted to galaxies with  M 
r  2 and we focus on how the
properties of galaxies of dierent luminosities depend on environment
r  1 Our sample reaches M 
31 Denition of Surface Galaxy Density
We determine surface galaxy density from the distance to the fth nearest neighbor in a pseudo
threedimensional fashion Since the galaxies in our sample have spectroscopic redshifts we dene
a redshift sheet of 1000 km s1 around the galaxy in question All galaxies within the sheet are
projected onto the redshift of the galaxy in question Galaxies outside the 1000 km s1 sheet are
not used in the calculation Then we search for the fth nearest neighbor and calculate surface
 6 
galaxy density in units of galaxies per square megaparsec This is exactly the same denition as
the one adopted by Miller et al 2003 Goto et al 2003b and Balogh et al 2004 Following
the convention we term the density dened in this way local density Note that local density is
actually a surface density Also note that the median error in recession velocity estimates in our
sample is  20 km s1 and we neglect eects of the error on density estimates
All galaxies that reach the survey boundary before nding their fth nearest neighbor are
excluded from the following analysis because the local densities of such galaxies are not correctly
calculated They are however used in the local density calculation of other galaxies As for
galaxies close to the redshift cuts we make a small compromise not to exclude all the galaxies
to gain sample statistics We exclude all galaxies that lie within 500 km s1 from the redshift
cuts but use galaxies between 500 and 1000 km s1 from the redshift cuts by applying a volume
correction Therefore all galaxies have a sheet width of at least 1500 km s1 so the maximum
correction factor is 20001500  133 We have conrmed that whether we make the compromise
or not does not alter our conclusions Because of ber collision some galaxies in dense environment
are not spectroscopically observed and we tend to underestimate densities in dense environment
We nd however that our results are not strongly aected by the ber collision A brief discussion
on this point is given in Appendix A
In our catalog 12 376 galaxies out of 19 714 have local density estimates and the rest of the
galaxies are too close to the boundary
32 The Star Formation-Density Relation
We investigate a correlation between star formation and local density To evaluate star for-
mation in galaxies we use the g  i color and the equivalent width EW of the H emission
Since we dene our volume-limited sample at relatively low redshifts a large fraction of galaxy
light is missed by the 3 diameter ber It is thus expected that a signicant fraction of the uxes
of nebular emission lines is not observed since such lines mostly originate from galaxy disks rather
than bulges Accordingly we tend to underestimate the ux of the emission lines Therefore care is
needed when interpreting emissionline properties in our sample A brief discussion of the aperture
bias is given in Appendix B In the main text of this paper we focus on the relative strength
rather than the absolute strength of star formation activity using EWH We do this because
errors in the absolute star formation rate estimates are dicult to estimate so we make various
corrections to derive absolute star formation rates from observed spectra and the uncertainty in
each correction is not well known Nevertheless even with such diculties and uncertainties the
environmental dependence of absolute star formation activity is worth investigating and we present
this analysis in Appendix C We also examine the g i color which is measured for the entire galaxy
and free from such xed-aperture bias Note that we apply no correction for the internal extinction
 7 
of EWH
Galaxies showing an AGN signature are not used when analyzing EWH We adopt NIIH
OIIIH diagnostics to select AGNs AGNs are dened as the 1 lower limit of the model
dened by Kewley et al 2001 When some of the lines are not available we make use of the
two-line method Miller et al 2003 In our sample 3371 galaxies are classied as AGNs Whether
or not we remove AGNs does not aect our results
In the following analysis we classify galaxies into two subclasses by absolute magnitude Here-
r  1  Mr 
r  2 as faint galaxies Our denition of the subsamples and the number of galaxies in each
r  1 are referred to as bright galaxies and those with M 
after galaxies with Mr  M 
subsample are summarized in Table 1
Figure 2 shows a correlation between g  i and local density The error bars represent the
90th percentile intervals estimated by bootstrap resampling The error includes the measurement
error in g  i assuming that the measurement error follows a Gaussian distribution A clear trend
can be seen in the sense that galaxies become redder as the environment in which they are located
becomes denser Bright galaxies show a correlation over the entire range of local density and the
color is a smooth function of local density In contrast faint galaxies have a break at a density of
log 5th  04 galaxies h 2
75 Mpc2 Above the break galaxies abruptly become redder while below
the break the color gradually changes with local density Faint galaxies are generally bluer than
bright galaxies and the trend is particularly prominent in low density regions On the other hand
the trend is largely reduced in dense environments where faint galaxies are only slightly bluer than
bright galaxies Note that the small color dierence in very dense regions log 5th  1 reects
the color-magnitude relation eg Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992 Kodama  Arimoto 1997
A correlation between EWH and local density is shown in Figure 3 On-going star formation
in galaxies measured from EWH also shows a dependence on local density The median EWH
of bright galaxies shows only a little change with local density But the 75th percentile shows a
monotonic decrease with increasing local density and no clear break can be seen Faint galaxies
have a strong break at the same density as found for g  i Fig 2 The change in median EWH
against local density is larger for faint galaxies On average faint galaxies are more actively forming
stars than bright galaxies This trend is particularly noticeable in low-density regions On the other
hand the star formation activity of faint galaxies is largely suppressed in dense regions where most
galaxies are quiescent independent of luminosity As discussed in Appendix B the aperture bias
in EWH cannot be ignored and if the trends in EWH are caused by the aperture bias is a
major concern However the overall trend seen for EWH is similar to that seen for g  i which
is free from the ber aperture bias This suggests that the observed trends in EWH are not a
product of the aperture bias
Let us investigate the observed trend further Following Balogh et al 2004 we dene galaxies
having EWH  4A as star-forming galaxies and examine their EWH Although the aperture
bias in our sample is stronger than that of Balogh et al 2004 our discussion does not strongly
 8 
rely on a particular choice within a reasonable range of the threshold value of EWH  This
investigation is particularly interesting because star-forming galaxies are expected to show reduced
star formation rates if they are aected by environmental mechanisms that trigger slow truncation of
star formation activities eg strangulation If galaxy star formation is suppressed on a very short
time-scale eg by mergers we do not expect to see strong changes in the EWH distribution
of star-forming galaxies the fraction of star-forming galaxies relative to non-star-forming galaxies
will change Here we aim to see whether or not there is a signature of the slow truncation
In the top panel of Figure 4 we show the EWH of star-forming galaxies as a function
of local density Bright star-forming galaxies do not show any dependence on local density A
Kolmogorov-Smirnov K-S test does not reject the hypothesis that galaxies above and below the
critical density log 5th  04 are drawn from the same parent population a K-S probability of
 60 The EWH of faint star-forming galaxies becomes slightly smaller above the critical
density The K-S test shows that faint star-forming galaxies above and below the critical density
are dierent  0001 This should be considered to be a signature of the slow truncation of the
star formation activity of faint galaxies We will further discuss this nding below
The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the fraction of star-forming galaxies as a function of local
density It can be seen that the fraction of star-forming galaxies decreases strongly with increasing
local density Combining the bottom panel with the top panel shows that the trend of bright
galaxies in Figure 3 entirely reects the change in the fraction of star-forming galaxies rather than
the change in the star formation activity of star-forming galaxies As for faint galaxies the critical
density is caused by the change in the fraction of star-forming galaxies and the change in the star
formation activity of star-forming galaxies However the former seems to be a stronger eect
33 The Morphology-Density Relation
Next we examine how the morphology of galaxies changes with local environment We adopt
the bulgetototal luminosity ratio BT  based on the growth curve tting technique Okamura et
al 1999 as an indicator of galaxy morphology We briey summarize the basic idea of the growth
curve tting method below The reader is referred to Okamura et al 1999 for further details
We prepare PSF-convolved template proles of various model galaxies that have a r14 bulge
and an exponential disk There are three parameters in the model the ratio of the eective radii of
the bulge and the disk the ratio of the eective radius of the disk to the size of seeing and the ratio
of the bulge to the total luminosity BT  The template proles are generated for a combination
of the parameters in reasonable ranges Then we compare the prole of a real galaxy with the
template proles and nd the besttting template We make use of the BT of the besttting
template as the indicator of morphology Note that the SDSS measures the prole of a galaxy in a
sequence of circular apertures and so the inclination of galaxies may aect BT estimates Using
only lowinclination galaxies ba  07 we have conrmed that our results are not aected by the
 9 
inclination eect Note as well that each model galaxy is assumed to be composed of a r14 bulge
and a exponential disk However of course real galaxies have more or less dierent radial proles
for each component The statistical robustness of this model has been conrmed by examining
a correlation between visually classied morphology and the BT of the best tting template for
nearby galaxies Okamura et al 1999 see their Figure 11
We demonstrate that our BT estimates are robust against the seeing eect We present BT
along with the inverse concentration index Cin  Shimasaku et al 2001 see also Strateva et al
2001 in Figure 5 Note that Cin is not corrected for seeing The seeing eect is investigated
from two dierent points of view First we examine BT and Cin and as a function of redshift
Since galaxies look smaller at higher redshift galaxies at higher redshift are more severely blurred
by the seeing This redshift eect is shown in the left panels It can be seen that Cin increases
Cin  002 with increasing redshift while BT remains essentially unchanged The right panels
show BT and Cin as a function of the PSF size To minimize the redshift eect described above
we select galaxies within 0055  z  0065 Cin increases slightly with increasing the PSF size
while BT does not show any signicant change From these results we conclude that our BT
estimates are robust against the seeing eect Since faint galaxies are smaller than bright galaxies
and they are more easily aected by the seeing eect one may suspect that morphologies of faint
galaxies are biased But we expect this is not the case
Figure 6 shows the morphological fractions based on BT as a function of local density Because
of the coarse grid of BT measurements BT  01 we cannot take the median of BT 
We adopt threshold values of BT  02 04 and 06 to analyze the morphological mix An
measurement error in BT is dicult to quantify since BT is estimated via multi-parameter
template tting Therefore an error in BT is not considered here The fraction of late-type
BT  02 04 and 06 bright galaxies decreases monotonically with increasing local density
and no break can be seen Faint galaxies show very dierent behavior with a visible break at
log crit  04 The late-type fractions do not show any signicant change below this critical
density whereas a strong change can be found above the critical density just like the trend seen
in star formation It seems that the morphological change of bright galaxies with local density is
stronger than or as strong as that of faint galaxies This is in contrast to the trend found for star
formation for which the changes in g  i and EWH are stronger for faint galaxies Moreover it
is interesting to note that faint galaxies are morphologically later than bright galaxies at any local
density Because morphology is somewhat ambiguous to quantify it is worth using Cin as another
indicator in addition to BT  although Cin is not stable in terms of seeing We have found that
Cin shows almost identical environmental trends with BT  and hence we do not present a Cin plot
In the previous subsection we showed how the EWH of star-forming galaxies EWH 
4A changes with local density Fig 4 We now perform a similar analysis for morphology For this
purpose we use Cin instead of BT because of the coarse grid of the BT estimates We examine
galaxies with Cin  045 late-types to see whether there is a slow transformation of morphology
 10 
in late-type galaxies We nd that based on the K-S test the morphological distribution of
bright late-type galaxies is not signicantly dierent above and below the critical density the K-S
probability of  30 while that of faint late-types may be dierent  5 and they may have
systematically smaller Cin above the critical density
34 The Bimodality of Galaxy Properties
It is known that the distribution of star formation and morphology is bimodal Strateva et al
2001 Kaumann et al 2003 Blanton et al 2003a Baldry et al 2004  namely there are two
distinct populations of galaxies star-forming late-type and nonstar-forming early-type galaxies
This bimodality is observed up to z  1 Bell et al 2004ab
To sum up the analyses of previous subsections we present in Figure 7 the relationship between
star formation and morphology in the four local density ranges Faint galaxies show more active
star formation than bright galaxies at a given BT  This trend is particularly prominent in low
density regions Hogg et al 2004 Thus the relationship between star formation and morphology
depends on both luminosity and environment However what strongly changes with environment
is the fraction of nonstar-forming early-type galaxies relative to star-forming late-types Further
illustrations of correlations between star formation morphology luminosity and local density are
presented in Appendix D
35 The Brightest Galaxies
We briey address the local density dependence of star formation and morphology of the
brightest galaxies Mr  M 
r  1 As shown in Figure 8 the star formation and morphology of the
brightest galaxies show little dependence on local density The brightest galaxies are all red early-
type galaxies regardless of local environment We have shown that galaxies of dierent luminosities
have dierent local density dependencies The brightest galaxies lie on the extreme end of that
trend they have no dependence on local density It should be noted that these brightest galaxies
are preferentially found in high density regions Hogg et al 2003 In that sense their presence
itself depends on environment
36 Summary of the Dependencies on Local Density
In this section we summarize how star formation and morphology change with local density
and luminosity We nd that star formation is strongly correlated both with local density and
luminosity Bright galaxies show a monotonic change in g  i and EWH with local density
Faint galaxies have a remarkable break at log crit  04 galaxies h2
75 Mpc2 The changes in
 11 
g  i and EWH from the lowest to highest density are stronger for faint galaxies The changes
primarily reect the change in the population fraction of star-forming galaxies relative to nonstar-
forming galaxies The luminosity dependence is particularly noticeable in the eld in the sense
that faint galaxies are more actively forming stars However this trend is largely reduced in dense
environment where most galaxies are not forming stars regardless of luminosity
Morphology is also a strong function of both local density and luminosity A break is found
at the same critical density as that found for star formation again only for faint galaxies The
morphological change of bright galaxies with local density is stronger than or as strong as that of
faint galaxies This is in contrast to the trend found for star formation implying that morphology
depends on luminosity in a dierent way than star formation For example in very dense regions
log 5th  1 star formation is extremely weak regardless of luminosity but morphology varies as
a function of luminosity
We have shown that star formation and morphology show slightly dierent behaviors depend-
ing on local density and luminosity This is partly because star formation and morphology are
independent properties Balogh et al 1998 Hashimoto Oemler Lin  Tucker 1998 Lewis et al
2002 Gomez et al 2003 The bimodality of galaxy properties is clearly seen in our sample We
nd that what strongly changes with local density is the fraction of blue late-type galaxies relative
to red early-type galaxies ie the relative heights of the two peaks in the bimodal distribution
change Further illustrations of the environmental dependencies are presented in Appendix D
Particularly interesting trends can be summarized as follows see also Table 2
1 For faint galaxies there is a critical density of log crit  04 galaxies h2
75 Mpc2 where star
formation and morphology change drastically
2 No such critical density is found for bright galaxies
3 The star formation and morphology of the brightest galaxies Mr  M 
r  1 do not correlate
with local density and they are all red early-type galaxies regardless of environment
4 The population fraction of blue late-type galaxies relative to red early-type galaxies varies
strongly with local density
5 The star formation activity of bright star-forming galaxies EWH  4A does not depend
on local density while that of faint star-forming galaxies is systematically weaker above the
critical density A similar trend seems to be apparent for morphology
6 The morphological change of bright galaxies with local density is stronger than or as strong
as that of faint galaxies whereas the change in star formation is stronger for faint galaxies
than for bright galaxies

4 DEPENDENCIES ON SYSTEM RICHNESS
In this section we focus on galaxy systems such as groups and clusters and examine galaxy
properties as a function of system richness This investigation is particularly interesting since
galaxies in poor and rich systems are considered to be in dierent stages of structure formation
Accordingly the amount of environmental eects they have suered should be dierent Previous
studies have reported correlations between galaxy properties and system richness For example
the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases as systems become rich eg Edge  Stewart 1991 Balogh
et al 2002 Goto et al 2003a although some poor systems have an early-type fraction identical

We apply a friends-of-friends algorithm FOFA to nd galaxy systems in our sample For
each galaxy system we measure velocity dispersion and use it as an indicator of system richness
Based on the extensive high-quality data of the SDSS we examine galaxies in galaxy systems in
detail To avoid duplicating discussion we use only EWH as an indicator of star formation in
this section We have conrmed that g  i follows a similar trend to EWH 
41 The Friends-of-Friends Algorithm
The FOFA is a famous group nding algorithm originally proposed by Huchra  Geller 1982
The statistical properties of the algorithm has been intensively studied using mock catalogs of N-
body simulations and is well known Moore Frenk  White 1993 Frederic 1995 Ramella Pisani
 Geller 1997 Diaferio Kaumann Colberg  White 1999 Merchan  Zandivarez 2002
The basic strategy of the FOFA is to nd a chunk of galaxies connected within certain threshold
lengths The threshold length is called the linking length There are two linking lengths angular
separation D0 and line-of-sight velocity dierence V0 There is one more parameter in the FOFA
Nmin which is a threshold of the number of member galaxies When a resultant chunk has galaxies
equal to or greater than Nmin the chunk is dened as a galaxy system
Previous studies have shown that the contamination of chance interlopers in FOFA groups is
relatively small with a density contrast of   80 Ramella Pisani  Geller 1997 Diaferio
Kaumann Colberg  White 1999 Merchan  Zandivarez 2002 The density contrast is dened
0 cid18Z Mlim
M dMcid19
where M  is a luminosity function and Mlim is a limiting absolute magnitude We estimate the
value of D0 with the luminosity function given in Blanton et al 2001 Adopting   160
we obtain D0  500 h 1
75 kpc The statistical properties of the resulting groups are not sensitive
 13 
to the choice of D0 Frederic 1995 Ramella Pisani  Geller 1997 Diaferio Kaumann Colberg
 White 1999 Merchan  Zandivarez 2002 On the other hand V0 is the key parameter in
constructing a group catalog After performing some experiments we found that V0  500 km s1
is a fairly reasonable choice and we adopt this value in our analysis By changing the value of
V0 from 300 km s1 to 700 km s1 with a step of 100 km s1 we have conrmed that our results
do not change signicantly The nal parameter Nmin is set at 5 since a large fraction of systems
with only a few galaxies is expected to be spurious Frederic 1995 Ramella Pisani  Geller 1997
Ramella Geller Pisani  da Costa 2002
It should be noted that we run the FOFA in the
volume-limited sample which means the linking lengths are xed independently of redshift We
note that the linking lengths are elongated along the line of sight 05 Mpc on the sky and 67 Mpc
along the line-of-sight to account for the ngerofGod eect
We calculate the velocity dispersions of galaxy systems using the gapper method Beers Flynn
 Gebhardt 1990 We found that the results presented in the next subsection are basically un-
changed if we implement the biweight estimator instead of the gapper method
42 Results
We nd 307 galaxy systems in our volume-limited sample Systems that lie too close to the
survey boundary and redshift cuts are not included To be specic if one of the member galaxies
is closer than  1 to the survey boundary or if the redshift cuts lie closer than 2 of velocity
dispersion the system will not be used in the following analysis As shown in Appendix E galaxies
in our FOFA catalog are not conned to the system core but extend to the outskirts Our system
is a fair representation of a system as a whole
We examine dependencies of galaxy properties on velocity dispersion As shown in Figure
9 the star formation and morphology of bright galaxies do not signicantly change with system
richness and bright galaxies are mostly nonstar-forming early-type galaxies As for faint galaxies
albeit with the large errors we cannot nd a clear trend in morphology But it seems that galaxies
become morphologically earlier in richer systems Note that faint galaxies are morphologically
later than bright galaxies in all systems Most of the faint galaxies in systems with   200 km s1
are non-star-forming galaxies see the median line in the gure Galaxies in systems as poor as
  100 km s1 seem to show weaker star formation activities than eld galaxies To clarify this
we compare the EWH distribution of galaxies in   75  125 km s1 systems with that of
eld galaxies The K-S probabilities are 04 for bright galaxies and 002 for faint galaxies
Therefore we emphasize that galaxy star formation in systems as poor as   100 km s1 is less
active compared with the eld The fraction of star-forming galaxies becomes slightly larger in
poor systems   200 km s1 However such poor systems may contain a non negligible fraction
of chance interlopers and the small change may not be real we do not quantify the amount of the
contamination here One may concern an eect of an error in our velocity dispersion estimates on
our results We nd that our results are essentially unchanged if we use the FOFA systems with a
 14 
relatively small bootstrap error in velocity dispersion   02
To clarify the relationship between this analysis and the discussion presented in the previous
section we show in Figure 10 the local density distribution of the entire sample the FOFA systems
with   200 km s1 and the FOFA systems with   200 km s1 It can be seen that galaxies
in the FOFA systems have high local density and a signicant fraction of galaxies at 5th  crit
belongs to the FOFA systems This means that the break in properties of faint galaxies presented in
the previous section is driven by the galaxy systems and therefore the critical environment where
faint galaxies change their properties is galaxy systems Galaxies in rich systems tend to have
higher local density than those in poor systems This might reect the fact that galaxies in systems
with   200 km s1 show more active star formation than those in systems with   200 km s1
43 Summary of the Dependencies on System Richness
We run the FOFA to nd galaxy systems and measure their velocity dispersions Bright
galaxies show little dependence on system richness and they are mostly non-star-forming early-
type galaxies Faint galaxies seem to show a weak change in their properties in very poor systems
  200 km s1 although the change may be driven at least in part by the contamination
of chance interlopers and unphysical associations An important point is that galaxies in  
200 km s1 systems are mostly non-star-forming galaxies and even galaxies in   100 km s1
systems show weaker star formation activities than those in the eld We nd that the FOFA
systems dominate the local density region of 5th  crit The break in properties of faint galaxies
reported in the previous section is driven by the circumstance that galaxies in systems have weaker
star formation activities and earlier morphological types than those in the eld
Our results can be summarized as follows see also Table 3
1 The star formation and morphology of bright galaxies show nearly no correlation with system
richness
2 Faint galaxies are dominated by non-star-forming galaxies at   200 km s1
3 Even in systems with   100 km s1 galaxies show weaker star formation activities than
those of eld galaxies
4 The star formation and morphology of faint galaxies show small changes at   200 km s1
but this may be caused by contamination by chance interlopers
5 Faint galaxies are morphologically later than bright galaxies in all systems
6 Galaxy systems dominate the local density range of 5th  crit Thus galaxy systems should
be the driver of the break in the properties of faint galaxies reported in the previous section

5 DISCUSSION
51 Comparison with Previous Studies
Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 and Balogh et al 2004 reported that star formation
in galaxies drops at local  1 galaxies h2
75 Mpc2 although the denition of local density diers
from author to author We have identied the critical density of 5th  25 galaxies h2
75 Mpc2
log 5th  04 The dierence in the critical density between our estimate and the previous
estimates is due to the dierence in the magnitude cut in the sample construction Lewis et al
2002 used galaxies brighter than M   075 and Gomez et al 2003 and Balogh et al 2004
adopted a magnitude cut of M   1 Thus the previous estimates are based on samples shallower by
 1 mag than our sample On the basis of the luminosity function given by Blanton et al 2001
the galaxy density in our sample is estimated to be twice as high as those in the previous authors
Therefore our critical density appears to be in good agreement with the previous estimates
However the previous found a break for Mr  M 
r  1 galaxies ie bright galaxies in our
denition for which we have identied no clear break eg see Fig 3 Our result is that only
faint galaxies show a break This discrepancy is possibly due to the quantitative dierence in the
denition of local density but note that Balogh et al 2004 adopted the same denition as ours
It should be noted that the previously reported breaks are not as prominent as the one we have
found This is probably because fainter galaxies tend to show a stronger break
Martnez et al 2002 claimed that there is a strong correlation between the relative fraction
of star forming galaxies and the virial mass of the parent system Since their spectral classication
is based on the PCA Madgwick et al 2002 and thus their denition of star-forming galaxies
is dierent from ours their results cannot be directly compared with our results
It is known
however that there is a clear correlation between their spectral index  and EWH Adopting
their threshold   14 as EWH  0A Madgwick et al 2002 we nd that the correlation
mostly arises from poor systems which are subject to interlopers and spurious systems
inner two bins in their Figure 2 which roughly correspond to   200 km s1 are excluded the
remaining correlation is not very signicant  2 It should be noted that their sample reaches
 M   25 and the galaxies are selected by bJ magnitude Therefore their sample as compared
with ours is biased toward starforming galaxies They also concluded that star formation in
group galaxies is strongly suppressed compared with eld galaxies even for very poor groups with
Mvirial  1013M which corresponds roughly to   250 km s1 This nding is in good agreement
with our result
Kaumann et al 2004 reported that at a xed stellar mass star formation and nuclear
activity depend strongly on local density while morphology is almost independent of local density
But lowmass galaxies Mstellar  3  1010M show morphological change in the highestdensity
environment Kaumann et als study is based on stellar masses of galaxies while ours is based on
luminosities of galaxies Thus direct comparisons cannot be made It is however worthwhile to
 16 
investigate the correspondence between our magnitude cut for separating bright and faint galaxies
Mr  M 
r  1 and the stellar mass Using the prescription of Baldry et al 2004 we nd that our
magnitude cut corresponds to logMstellarM  106 for red galaxies and logMstellarM  102
for blue galaxies Baldry et al 2004 found that red galaxies dominate the stellar mass range of
logMstellarM  102 while blue galaxies dominate the lower stellar mass range This should
reect the fact that bright galaxies are redder than faint galaxies in a statistical sense Fig 2
We nd that morphology changes as a function of local density even for bright galaxies It is not
immediately clear whether this nding is inconsistent with Kaumann et al 2004 since they use
the concentration index which is subject to the seeing eect as shown in 33 and their denition
of local density is dierent from ours We do not try to compare the results here It is found in 3
that faint galaxies show the break at the critical density while bright galaxies do not This may
be related to the fact that our magnitude cut for separating bright and faint galaxies corresponds
to logMstellarM  102 for blue galaxies where the midpoint of the transition of galaxy
properties is reported to occur Baldry et al 2004
52 Physical Interpretations
521 Proposed Mechanisms
It has long been known that galaxies in rich systems follow a dierent evolutionary path from
those in the eld There are many nonstar-forming early-type galaxies in rich systems whereas
star-forming spiral galaxies are generally found in the eld Dressler 1980 Balogh et al 1997
Hashimoto Oemler Lin  Tucker 1998 Balogh et al 1999 Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003
Goto et al 2003b Balogh et al 2004
Several mechanisms have been proposed to drive the observed environmental dependence of
galaxy properties Ram pressure stripping is one of the environmental mechanisms expected to be
eective in the cores of rich systems Gunn  Gott 1972 Abadi Moore  Bower 1999 Quilis
Moore  Bower 2000 When a galaxy moves through the hot intracluster medium at a high speed
it feels a wind and the cold gas in it will be stripped o Moreover galaxies in rich systems
experience highvelocity encounters with other galaxies harassment Should such encounters
occur successively galaxy disks would be destroyed and starbursts would be triggered Moore et
al 1996a Fujita 1998 Moore Lake Quinn  Stadel 1999 Mihos 2003
Interactions with the
gravitational potential of the system should also be signicant Byrd  Valtonen 1990
In semi-analytic galaxy evolution models galaxies are assumed to have hot halo gas and the
gas is lost when they sink into a larger halo like a group or a cluster eg Okamoto  Nagashima
2003 If the halo gas is the source of the cold gas in the disk then the lack of halo gas leads to a slow
decline in SFR  1Gyr as the galaxy consumes the remaining cold gas Larson Tinsley  Caldwell
1980 Balogh Navarro  Morris 2000 Diaferio et al 2001 This mechanism is often referred
to as strangulation suocation starvation or halogas stripping Here we call it strangulation
 17 
Strangulation models have achieved great success in reproducing star formation in galaxies in rich
systems Balogh Navarro  Morris 2000 Diaferio et al 2001 Okamoto  Nagashima 2003 A
remarkable feature is that the radial distribution of star formation strength in rich systems can be
reproduced by the strangulation eect
Low-velocity interactions between galaxies will trigger starbursts consuming the cold gas in
the galaxies and weaken subsequent star formation activity Actually galaxies in close pairs show
enhanced star formation rates over those of isolated galaxies and probably they are currently in the
process of interaction Patton et al 1997 Barton Geller  Kenyon 2000 Lambas et al 2003 The
morphology of galaxies will be more or less disturbed depending on the strength of an interaction
For an extreme case a major merger will produce a single elliptical galaxy after strong starbursts
eg Mihos  Hernquist 1996
The above mechanisms can be categorized into two broad classes mechanisms that are eective
only in rich systems ram pressure stripping of cold gas and harassment and mechanisms that are
eective in other environments such as poor systems and the eld strangulation and low-velocity
interactions
In the following subsections we discuss implications of our ndings in regard to
putting constraints on the proposed mechanisms and galaxy evolution First we focus on the
dependence of galaxy properties on system richness because the eects of the proposed mechanisms
are expected to be a strong function of system richness Then implications of the dependencies on
local density are discussed to put further constraints Finally we briey address galaxy evolution
522 System Richness Dependencies
In 4 we showed that nonstar-forming galaxies make up the dominant population even in
galaxy systems as poor as   200 km s1 Table 3 Now we ask what mechanism can explain this
observation Numerical studies have shown that ram pressure stripping of cold gas is only eective
in the cores of rich systems where galaxies are moving at high speeds and the hot intracluster
medium is abundant Abadi Moore  Bower 1999 The same is true for harassment Moore
Katz  Lake 1996b These mechanisms cannot be eective in systems as poor as   200 km s1
We recall that galaxies in systems as poor as   100 km s1 show weaker star formation activities
than those in the eld Accordingly the dominant population in such poor systems cannot be fully
explained by those mechanisms Therefore it is likely that any mechanisms that are eective only in
rich systems have not played a major role in transforming galaxies into nonstar-forming galaxies
Rather mechanisms that are eective in the eld andor in poor systems such as low-velocity
interactions and strangulation are the candidates of interest
 18 
523 Local Density Dependencies
To obtain a deeper insight into the mechanisms involved we focus on passive spirals Couch et
al 1998 Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 Goto et al 2003c or equivalently anemic spirals
van den Bergh 1976 Passive spirals are considered to be products of ram pressure stripping of
cold gas or strangulation since these mechanisms suppress star formation activity in galaxies but
do not strongly disturb their morphology The reader is referred to Goto et al 2003c for an
extensive analysis of passive spirals
We dene passive spirals as those with EWH  0 and BT  02 The population fraction
of passive spirals as a function of local density is shown in Figure 11a Bright passive spirals live
in all local environment uniformly On the other hand faint passive spirals preferentially reside in
dense regions especially regions denser than the critical density log 5th  04 It is therefore
suggested that ram pressure stripping of cold gas andor strangulation is at work on faint galaxies
in dense environment
To discriminate between ram pressure stripping of cold gas and strangulation the population
fraction of passive spirals as a function of system richness is examined As shown in Figure 11b
the fraction of faint passive spirals seem to increase with system richness However the trend should
not be over interpreted because of the poor statistics The K-S test shows that the distribution of
passive spirals is not very dierent from that of the parent sample the K-S probabilities of 80
for bright galaxies and 23 for faint galaxies The interesting point here is that we nd passive
spirals in poor systems   300 km s1 as well as in richer systems Passive spirals in such
poor systems are not expected to be products of the ram pressure stripping of cold gas Therefore
it is likely that strangulation actually plays a role in suppressing star formation in faint galaxies
However if so it is puzzling that bright galaxies are not aected by strangulation
Since properties of bright galaxies have no break at the critical density and their properties
show a monotonic change over the entire local density range their environmental dependencies
may be determined by a mechanism that works even in the eld namely low-velocity interactions
The fact that morphology of bright galaxies strongly changes with local density supports this
view Figure 5 We have shown that the brightest galaxies Mr  M 
r  1 are all red early-
type galaxies independent of environment This would be additional supporting evidence because
the nal products of interactions and mergers are expected to be luminous early-type galaxies
However some points are left unexplained For example if the morphology-density relation of
bright galaxies is a product of low-velocity interactions why does the morphology of faint galaxies
fail to show any change below the critical density One possible interpretation is that dierent
mechanisms aect galaxies of dierent luminosities That is the primary eect on bright galaxies
is low-velocity interactions while that on faint galaxies it is strangulation There is however no
theoretical background for this interpretation Further studies are required to pursue the issue
further
 19 
524 Environmental Eects in the Local universe
If galaxies are currently under the inuence of environmental eects that cause the slow trans-
formation of galaxy properties eg strangulation we expect to see a signature of the transfor-
mation eg reduced star formation rates in star-forming galaxies
In 3 we showed that the
distribution of the star formation rates of bright star-forming galaxies EWH  4A does not
change with local density Similarly morphology of bright late-type galaxies Cin  045 does not
change with local density
There are at least three ways to interpret this result One is that the time scale of the
transformation of bright galaxies is too short to observe the transition phase Another is that
the transformation of bright galaxies occurs in all environments uniformly The other is that the
transformation of bright galaxies does not frequently occur in the local universe Unfortunately
we cannot clearly discriminate these possibilities quantitatively But it can be said that there is
no clear signature of the slow transformation of bright galaxies in dense regions
As for faint galaxies star-forming galaxies show the reduced star formation rates above the
critical density Morphology also seems to change This is a clear signature of the slow transforma-
tion in galaxy systems such as groups and clusters The fact that there are faint passive spirals in a
dense environment oers supporting evidence But we do not mean that there is no rapid transfor-
mation the rapid transformation does not produce for example the reduced star formation rates
in star-forming galaxies and we cannot put any constraint on it To summarize we suggest that
the slow transformation of faint galaxies occurs to some extent in a dense environment in the local
universe The transformation of bright galaxies is poorly constrained with the results at hand but
there is no clear signature of the slow transformation of bright galaxies in dense environment
Implications for Galaxy Evolution
Because galaxies in the local universe are nal products of galaxy evolution over the Hubble
time it is interesting to discuss what our ndings tell about galaxy evolution As shown in 42
the environment denser than the critical density corresponds to galaxy systems see also Appendix
E Thus the presence of a break at this critical density means that galaxies are aected by galaxy
systems
If galaxies are aected by system-specic mechanisms red early-type galaxies will be
accumulated in galaxy systems over time Accordingly we expect to observe a strong change in the
galaxy population around the critical density This is what we see in faint galaxies Fig 4 The
fact that bright galaxies show no break at the critical density suggests that their evolution is not
strongly related to galaxy systems such as groups and clusters Therefore it seems that bright and
faint galaxies have followed dierent evolutionary paths It is however unclear why the inuence
from systems weakens with increasing galaxy luminosity We need to study fainter galaxies and
galaxies at higher redshift to address this point Comparisons with semi-analytic models that take
into account the eects of both interactions and strangulation eg Okamoto  Nagashima 2003
will improve our understanding We leave them for future work
 20 
6 CONCLUSIONS
We have examined the environmental dependence of star formation and morphology of galaxies
on the basis of data from the SDSS Galaxies are restricted to the redshift range of 0030  z  0065
and the magnitude range of Mr  M 
r  2  194 which is deeper by 1 mag than previous
volume-limited studies Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 Goto et al 2003b Balogh et al 2004
We adopt g  i color and EWH as star formation indicators as well as BT Okamura et al
1999 and Cin Shimasaku et al 2001 as morphology Our sample is divided into two subclasses
by the absolute magnitude of M 
r  1 as shown in Table 1
We investigated the dependence of galaxy properties on local density There is a critical density
log 5th  04 at which both star formation and morphology abruptly change The break at the
critical density is seen only for faint galaxies and bright galaxies show no clear break Figs 2-6
which appears to be inconsistent with previous studies Lewis et al 2002 Gomez et al 2003 Goto
et al 2003b Balogh et al 2004 We have thus found that galaxies of dierent luminosities have
dierent dependencies on local density As an extreme case the properties of the brightest galaxies
Mr  M 
r  1 show no correlation with local density at all All the correlations with local density
are summarized in 36 and Table 2
We also have focused on richness of galaxy systems We apply the friends-of-friends algorithm
to nd galaxy systems in our sample The statistical properties of galaxies have only weak depen-
dence on system richness The only exception is a clear increase of star-forming late-type galaxies
in very poor systems   200 km s1 Figure 9 although this increase is possibly caused by the
contamination of chance interlopers We nd that the FOFA systems dominate the local density
region of 5th  crit and this should be the driver of the break The trends found as a function
of richness are summarized in 43 and Table 3
We suggest that mechanism that are eective in the eld andor in poor systems such as
low-velocity interactions eg mergers and strangulation are the preferred candidates to explain
the observed trends From the environmental distribution of passive spirals it is suggested that
strangulation actually works on faint galaxies However it is puzzling that bright passive spirals
have no preference of environment The slow transformation eg strangulation of faint galaxies
occurs to some extent in a dense environment in the local universe but that of bright galaxies is
not clearly seen in dense environment The fact that faint galaxies show a break in their properties
at the critical density suggests that their evolution is closely related to galaxy systems On the
other hand bright galaxies show no break and their evolution is expected to have little connection
with galaxy systems However some unanswered questions are left and further investigations are
required

A Fiber Collision
Because of instrumental constraints an SDSS spectroscopic ber cannot be placed closer than
55 to the neighboring ber resulting in reduced completeness in dense environments To correct
for this incompleteness we need to know the probability that a missed galaxy will fall in the redshift
range under consideration and this is indeed very dicult to evaluate What we mean by a missed
galaxy is a galaxy that is targeted for the Main Galaxy Sample but not fed any ber
We can naively expect that the probability correlates at least to some extent with the surface
galaxy density in our redshift range
If the position of a missed galaxy in the sky corresponds
to eld environment in our redshift range the probability will be low since galaxies are thinly
populated around the missed galaxy On the other hand if a missed galaxy falls in a cluster in our
redshift range the probability will be high since the missed galaxy can be expected to be a cluster
member
We make a very rough estimate of the eect of the ber collision on our density estimates It
is somewhat dicult to evaluate the eect of the ber collision in low-density environments since
the probability of the eect occurring is low and it is a non-trivial problem to know how low But
the overall completeness of the SDSS spectroscopic survey is very high  90 and we expect
that ber collision is not a severe problem for eld galaxies Thus we focus on dense environments
and evaluate the eect on our density estimates We select galaxies in environments denser than
the critical density in our sample and count missed galaxies that lie within 55 from the selected
galaxies We nd 1049 missed galaxies for 3505 selected galaxies Assuming all the missed galaxies
fall in our redshift range we nd that we underestimate densities above the critical density by a
factor of 35053505  1049  077 ie approximately 01 dex on average This should be
considered a lower limit because not all the missed galaxies are in our redshift range The amount
of the underestimation is relatively small and therefore we conclude that ber collision does not
signicantly change our results
B Aperture Bias
Spectroscopic observation in the SDSS is performed through 3 diameter bers which are
smaller than a typical size of galaxies used in this paper Thus a non negligible fraction of galaxy
light is missed from each ber and we inevitably underestimate the ux of galaxies This aperture
bias is particularly signicant when we analyze nebular emission lines which are expected to come
mainly from a galaxy disk rather than a bulge
We present the distribution of the ratio of the ber radius to the galaxy radius in Figure 12
We adopt Petrosian 90 radius as a radius of a galaxy The ratio can be used for a very rough
estimate of the amount of the aperture bias Of course star-forming regions are not uniformly
distributed within a galaxy Thus the relative dierence in the ratio does not simply reect the
 27 
relative strength of the aperture bias Note that the environment might aect the distribution of
star-forming regions in galaxies Moss  Whittle 2000 The top panel is for our volume-limited
sample 0030  z  0065 and Mr  M 
r  2 and the bottom panel is for the volume-limited
sample often used in the literature 005  z  010 and Mr  M 
r  1 In our sample each ber
subtends only  20 of the galaxy radius This means only  4 of a surface area of a galaxy is
included in a ber Actually each ber will collect light from a larger area related to the eect of
the seeing However there is no doubt that we have a signicant aperture bias in EWH In the
bottom panel the ratio increases to  23 ie a  15 increase compared with the top panel
But even in this case a ber covers only  5 of a surface area of a galaxy
Since the size of a galaxy is a function of luminosity the aperture bias is a function of luminosity
As shown in Figure 13 the bergalaxy radius ratio changes with absolute magnitude ratio 
15 for our case We investigated the luminosity dependence of EWH in 3 but the results
should not be over interpreted because of the strong aperture bias However the fact that color
which is free from the xed-aperture bias and EWH show almost identical environmental
dependencies suggests that most of the dependencies of EWH are not driven by the aperture
It is interesting to note that the aperture bias is a stronger function of luminosity in the
volume-limited sample of 005  z  01 on which most of the previous studies are based
C Environmental Dependence of Absolute SFR
We present the environmental dependence of absolute SFR There are several formulae in the
literature to convert H ux to SFRs eg Kennicutt 1998 Hopkins Connolly Haarsma  Cram
2001 Charlot  Longhetti 2001 Hopkins et al 2003 We follow the recipe of Hopkins et al 2003
their eq B2 to correct for dust extinction and xed-ber aperture and estimate absolute SFRs
The reader is referred to that paper for details on the procedure
The absolute SFR as a function of local density is presented in Figure 14a The median SFRs
show a similar trend to that seen in Figure 3 bright galaxies show no clear break whereas faint
galaxies have a strong break The dependence of the absolute SFR on system richness is shown in
Figure 14b The trend is essentially the same as that found in Figure 9
D Dependence on Local Density and Luminosity
Further illustrations of the relationship between star formation morphology luminosity and
local density are presented in this appendix Figure 15 shows the dependence of star formation
and morphology on the local density and absolute magnitude plane As found in Figures 2 and
3 star formation is a strong function of both local density and luminosity In very dense regions
log 5th  1 there is no strong correlation with either local density or luminosity and most of the
galaxies are red The strong luminosity dependence can be seen in the eld region log crit  04
 28 
in the sense that fainter galaxies are more actively forming stars It should be noted that the strong
aperture bias should contribute to the luminosity dependence see Appendix B However the fact
that g  i and EWH show the identical luminosity dependence suggests that the contribution is
small The trends seen for morphology are similar to those found for star formation although the
luminosity dependence seems to be stronger
E Correlations between Environmental Parameters
We show some representative examples of the correlation between environmental parameters
in Figure 16 Figure 16a plots the radial distribution of galaxies in the linked list of the FOFA
as a function of velocity dispersion The projected center of a system is estimated by averaging the
projected galaxy positions weighted by the velocity dierence with respect to the system velocity
center We use r200 as an estimate of the virial radius of a system The r200 is dened as the
radius in which the mean interior density is 200 times the critical density of the universe In our
cosmology r200 can be obtained from
r200  231  z15 h1
75 kpc
where  is velocity dispersion of a system in unit of kilometers per second Carlberg Yee 
Ellingson 1997 It can be seen that galaxies in the FOFA systems extend beyond the virial radius
 15r200 That is our sample covers the outskirts of galaxy systems Galaxies in poor systems
extend far beyond the virial radius This might be because galaxies in such poor systems are not
yet virialized and the assumption of the virial theorem in the calculation of r200 is not valid
Figure 16b plots local density against clustercentric radius In this panel only galaxies within
3 from the system redshift are plotted There is a clear correlation between the two quantities We
have reported that there is the critical density at log crit  04 at which point galaxy properties
abruptly change It can be seen that the critical density corresponds to 1  2 r200
