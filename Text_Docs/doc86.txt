Abstract
We present a short and direct derivation of Hawking radiation as a tunneling
process based on particles in a dynamical geometry The imaginary part of
the action for the classically forbidden process is related to the Boltzmann fac-
tor for emission at the Hawking temperature Because the derivation respects
conservation laws the exact spectrum is not precisely thermal We compare
and contrast the problem of spontaneous emission of charged particles from
a charged conductor
I INTRODUCTION
Several derivations of Hawking radiation exist in the literature 12 None of them
however correspond very directly to one of the heuristic pictures most commonly proposed
to visualize the source of the radiation as tunneling According to this picture the radiation
arises by a process similar to electron-positron pair creation in a constant electric eld The
idea is that the energy of a particle changes sign as it crosses the horizon so that a pair
created just inside or just outside the horizon can materialize with zero total energy after
one member of the pair has tunneled to the opposite side
Here we shall show that this schematic can be used to provide a short direct semi-classical
derivation of black hole radiance In what follows energy conservation plays a fundamental
role one must make a transition between states with the same total energy and the mass
of the residual hole must go down as it radiates Indeed it is precisely the possibility of
lowering the black hole mass which ultimately drives the dynamics This supports the idea
that in quantum gravity black holes are properly regarded as highly excited states
Broadly speaking there are two standard approaches to Hawking radiation In the rst
one considers a collapse geometry The response of external elds to this can be done
explicitly or implicitly by abstracting appropriate boundary conditions In the second one
treats the black hole immersed in a thermal bath
In this approach one shows that in
general metastable equilibrium is possible By detailed balance this implies emission from
the hole In both the standard calculations the background geometry is considered xed
and energy conservation is not enforced during the emission process
Here we will consider a hole in empty Schwarzschild space but with a dynamical geometry
so as to enforce energy conservation Despite appearances the geometry is not truly static
since there is no global Killing vector Because we are treating this aspect more realistically
we must  and do  nd corrections to the standard results These become quantitively
signicant when the quantum of radiation carries a substantial fraction of the mass of the
II TUNNELING
To describe across-horizon phenomena it is necessary to choose coordinates which unlike
Schwarzschild coordinates are not singular at the horizon A particularly suitable choice is
obtained by introducing a time coordinate
t  ts  22M r  2M ln
r  2M
r  2M
where ts is Schwarzschild time With this choice the line element reads
ds2  cid181 
r cid19 dt2  2s2M
dt dr  dr2  r2d2 
There is now no singularity at r  2M and the true character of the spacetime as being
stationary but not static is manifest These coordinates were rst introduced by Painleve
3 who used them to criticize general relativity for allowing singularities to come and go
Their utility for studies of black hole quantum mechanics was emphasized more recently in
For our purposes the crucial features of these coordinates are that they are stationary
and nonsingular through the horizon Thus it is possible to dene an eective vacuum
state of a quantum eld by requiring that it annihilate modes which carry negative frequency
with respect to t such a state will look essentially empty in any case nonsingular to a
freely-falling observer as he or she passes through the horizon This vacuum diers strictly
from the standard Unruh vacuum dened by requiring positive frequency with respect to
the Kruskal coordinate U  r  2M expcid16 tsr
4M cid17 5 The dierence however shows up
only in transients and does not aect the late-time radiation
The radial null geodesics are given by
 1 s 2M
r 
with the upper lower sign in Eq 3 corresponding to outgoing ingoing geodesics under the
implicit assumption that t increases towards the future These equations are modied when
the particles self-gravitation is taken into account Self-gravitating shells in Hamiltonian
gravity were studied by Kraus and Wilczek 6 They found that when the black hole mass
is held xed and the total ADM mass allowed to vary a shell of energy  moves in the
geodesics of a spacetime with M replaced by M   If instead we x the total mass and
allow the hole mass to uctuate then the shell of energy  travels on the geodesics given
by the line element
ds2   1 
2M  
 dt2  2s 2M  
dt dr  dr2  r2d2 
so we should use Eq 3 with M  M  
Since the typical wavelength of the radiation is of the order of the size of the black
hole one might doubt whether a point particle description is appropriate However when
the outgoing wave is traced back towards the horizon its wavelength as measured by local
ducial observers is ever-increasingly blue-shifted Near the horizon the radial wavenumber
approaches innity and the point particle or WKB approximation is justied
The imaginary part of the action for an s-wave outgoing positive energy particle which
crosses the horizon outwards from rin to rout can be expressed as
Im S  ImZ rout
pr dr  ImZ rout
rin Z pr
Remarkably this can be evaluated without entering into the details of the solution as follows
We multiply and divide the integrand by the two sides of Hamiltons equation r   dH
dprcid12cid12cid12r
change variable from momentum to energy and switch the order of integration to obtain
Im S  ImZ M 
M Z rout
dH  ImZ 
0 Z rout
1 q 2M 
d  
where we have used the modied Eq 3 and the minus sign appears because H  M   
But now the integral can be done by deforming the contour so as to ensure that positive
energy solutions decay in time that is into the lower half   plane In this way we obtain
Im S  4cid18M 
2cid19 
provided rin  rout To understand this ordering  which supplies the correct sign  we
observe that when the integrals in Eq 5 are not interchanged and with the contour evaluated
via the prescription     i we have
rin Z M 
Im S  ImZ rout
1 q 2M 
dr  ImZ rout
rin r dr 
Hence rin  2M and rout  2 M   Incidentally comparing the above equation with
Eq 5 we also nd that Im pr  r Although this radially inward motion appears
at rst sight to be classically allowed it is nevertheless a classically forbidden trajectory
because the apparent horizon is itself contracting Thus the limits on the integral indicate
that over the course of the classically forbidden trajectory the outgoing particle starts from
r  2M   just inside the initial position of the horizon and traverses the contracting
horizon to materialize at r  2M     just outside the nal position of the horizon
Alternatively and along the same lines Hawking radiation can also be regarded as pair
creation outside the horizon with the negative energy particle tunneling into the black
hole Since such a particle propagates backwards in time we have to reverse time in the
equations of motion From the line element Eq 2 we see that time-reversal corresponds to
r  q 2M
r  Also since the anti-particle sees a geometry of xed black hole mass the
upshot of self-gravitation is to replace M by M   rather than M   Thus an ingoing
negative energy particle has
Im S  ImZ 
0 Z rin
1 q 2M 
d   4cid18M 
2cid19 
where to obtain the last equation we have used Feynmans hole theory deformation of the
contour       i
Both channels  particle or anti-particle tunneling  contribute to the rate for the Hawk-
ing process so in a more detailed calculation one would have to add their amplitudes before
squaring in order to obtain the semi-classical tunneling rate Such considerations however
only concern the pre-factor In either treatment the exponential part of the semi-classical
emission rate in agreement with 78 is
  e2 Im S  e8M  
2   eSBH 
where we have expressed the result more naturally in terms of the change in the holes
Bekenstein-Hawking entropy SBH When the quadratic term is neglected Eq 10 reduces
to a Boltzmann factor for a particle with energy  at the inverse Hawking temperature
8M The 2 correction arises from the physics of energy conservation which roughly
speaking self-consistently raises the eective temperature of the hole as it radiates That
the exact result must be correct can be seen on physical grounds by considering the limit
in which the emitted particle carries away the entire mass and charge of the black hole
corresponding to the transmutation of the black hole into an outgoing shell There can
be only one such outgoing state On the other hand there are exp SBH states in total
Statistical mechanics then asserts that the probability of nding a shell containing all the
mass of the black hole is proportional to exp SBH as above
Following standard arguments Eq 10 with the quadratic term neglected implies the
Planck spectral ux appropriate to an inverse temperature of 8M
  
 T 2

where  T 2 is the frequency-dependent greybody transmission co-ecient for the out-
going particle to reach future innity without back-scattering It arises from a more complete
treatment of the modes whose semi-classical behavior near the turning point we have been
discussing
The preceding techniques can also be applied to emission from a charged black hole
However when the outgoing radiation carries away the black holes charge the calculations
are complicated by the fact that the trajectories are now also subject to electromagnetic
forces Here we restrict ourselves to uncharged radiation coming from a Reissner-Nordstrom
black hole The derivation then proceeds in a similar fashion to that above
The charged counterpart to the Painleve line element is
ds2   1 
r2  dt2  2s 2M
dt dr  dr2  r2d2 
which is obtained from the standard Reissner-Nordstrom line element by the coordinate
transformation

r  2M r  Q2
Q2  M 2

arctanh M 2  Q22M r  Q2
where tr is the Reissner time coordinate The line element now manifestly displays the
stationary nonstatic and nonsingular nature of the spacetime
The equation of motion for an outgoing massless particle is
 1 s 2M

with M  M   when self-gravitation is included 9 The imaginary part of the action
for a positive energy outgoing particle is

which is again evaluated by deforming the contour in accordance with Feynmans w  wi
prescription The residue at the pole can be read o by substituting u  q2 M    r  Q2
This yields an emission rate of

To rst order in  Eq 16 is consistent with Hawkings result of thermal emission at the
Hawking temperature TH  for a charged black hole

Again energy conservation implies that the exact result has corrections of higher order in
 these can all be collected to express the emission rate as the exponent of the change in
entropy Moreover since the emission rate has to be real the presence of the rst square root
in Eq 16 ensures that radiation past extremality is not possible Unlike in the traditional
formulas the third law of black hole thermodynamics is here manifestly enforced
Note that only local physics has gone into our derivations There was neither an appeal
to Euclideanization nor any need to invoke an explicit collapse phase The time asym-
metry leading to outgoing radiation arose instead from use of the normal local contour
deformation prescription in terms of the nonstatic coordinate t
III RELATION TO ELECTRIC DISCHARGE
The calculation presented above is formally self-contained but some additional discussion
is in order to elucidate its physical meaning and to dispel a puzzle it poses
When considered at the very broadest level radiation of mass from a black hole resembles
tunneling of electric charge o a charged conducting sphere Upon a moments reection
however the dierence in the physics of the two situations appears so striking as to pose
a puzzle For while the electric force between like charges is repulsive the gravitational
force is always attractive Related to this the eld energy of electric elds is positive while
heuristically the eld energy of gravitational elds is negative On this basis one might
think that the electric process should proceed spontaneously and need not require tunneling
while the gravitational process has no evident reason to proceed at all
Consider a conducting sphere of radius R carrying charge Q The electric eld energy
can be lowered by emitting a charge q so we expect this process to occur spontaneously If
we neglect back-reaction of the charge q on the conducting sphere the force is repulsive at
all distances and there is no barrier to emission In a more accurate treatment however
we must take into account the induced non-uniformity of the charge on the sphere which is
easily done using the method of images The eective potential is
V r  qcid18 Q  q
r2  R2cid19 
where we consider congurations of image charge which leave the potential on the sphere
constant and the eld at innity xed In the formal limit Q  q the rst term dominates
and the potential decreases monotonically with r indicating no barrier However the second
term increases monotonically with r and always dominates for r  R producing a barrier
In the gravitational problem the situation is just the reverse With back-reaction ne-
glected there is nothing but barrier Yet our calculation including back-reaction indicates
the possibility of redistributing mass-energy of the gravitating sphere black hole into ki-
netic energy of emitted radiation
Since the intrinsic energy of the gravitational eld is negative it is disadvantageous
to reduce it point by point However since in general the spacetime containing a black
hole is not globally static there exist freely propagating negative energy modes inside the
horizon which cause the black hole to shrink As a consequence the black holes radius
decreases and the external volume of space over which one integrates the eld increases
This kinematically is why the radiation process is allowed Were the hole geometry to be
regarded as xed there would be no possible source for the kinetic energy of the radiation
and a genuine tunneling interpretation of Hawking radiation would appear to be precluded
IV CONCLUSION
We have derived Hawking radiation from the heuristically familiar perspective of tunnel-
ing Our derivation is in consonance with intuitive notions of black hole radiance but by
taking into account global conservation laws we are led to a modication of the emission
spectrum away from thermality The resulting corrected formula has physically reason-
able limiting cases and by virtue of nonthermality suggests the possibility of information-
carrying correlations in the radiation
