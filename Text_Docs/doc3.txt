Abstract  
The human T cell repertoire is complex and is generated by the rearrangement of variable V diversity 
D and joining J segments on the T cell receptor TCR loci The T cell repertoire demonstrates self-
similarity in terms clonal frequencies when defined by V D and J gene segment usage therefore to 
determine whether the structural ordering of these gene segments on the TCR loci contributes to the 
observed clonal frequencies the TCR loci were examined for self-similarity and periodicity in terms of 
gene segment organization Logarithmic transformation of numeric sequence order demonstrated that 
the V and J gene segments for both T cell receptor  TRA and  TRB loci were arranged in a self-
similar manner when the spacing between the adjacent segments was considered as a function of the size 
of the neighboring gene segment with an average fractal dimension of 15 The ratio of genomic 
distance between either the J in TRA or D in TRB segments and successive V segments on these loci 
declined logarithmically with a slope of similar magnitude Accounting for the gene segments occurring 
on helical DNA molecules in a logarithmic distribution sine and cosine functions of the log transformed 
angular coordinates of the start and stop nucleotides of successive TCR gene segments showed an 
ordered progression from the 5 to the 3 end of the locus supporting a log-periodic organization T cell 
clonal frequencies based on V and J segment usage from three normal stem cell donors were plotted 
against the V and J segment on TRB locus and demonstrated a periodic distribution We hypothesize 
that this quasi-periodic variation in gene-segment representation in the T cell clonal repertoire may be 
influenced by the location of the gene segments on the periodic-logarithmically scaled TCR loci 
Interactions between the two strands of DNA in the double helix may influence the probability of gene 
segment usage by means of either constructive or destructive interference resulting from the 
superposition of the two helices

Introduction 
T cells are central to the normal execution of adaptive immunity allowing identification of a multitude 
of pathogens and transformed cells encountered in an organisms lifetime T cells accomplish this task 
by recognizing peptide-MHC complexes by means of hetero-dimeric T cell receptors TCRs expressed 
on their surface The TCR serve the primary antigen recognition function in adaptive immune responses 
TCRs are comprised of either an alpha and a beta chain TCR  in the majority of T cells or less 
frequently gamma and delta chains TCR  1 The ability of the human T cells to recognize a vast 
array of pathogens and initiate specific adaptive immune responses depends on the versatility of the 
TCR which is generated by recombination of specific variable V diversity D and joining J 
segments in the case of TCR  and unique V and J segments for TCR   and  Complementarity 
determining regions CDR are the most variable part of the TCR and complement an antigen-major 
histocompatibility complexs shape The CDR is divided into 3 regions termed CDR1-3 and of these 
CDR1 and CDR2 are coded for entirely by the V segment whereas CDR3 incorporates a part of the V 
segment and the entire D and J segments for TCR  and parts of the V and J segments for TCR  CDR3 
is the most variable region and interacts with the target oligo-peptide lodged in the antigen binding 
groove of the HLA molecule of an antigen presenting cell 2 The germ line TCR  locus on 
chromosome 7q34 has two constant two D fourteen J and sixty-four V gene segments which are 
recombined during T cell development to yield numerous VDJ recombined T cell clones likewise TCR 
 locus on chromosome 14q11 has one constant sixty-one J and fifty-four V segments 3 Further 
variability and antigen recognition capacity is introduced by nucleotide insertion NI in the recombined 
TCR  and  VDJ sequences This generates a vast T cell repertoire yielding in excess of a trillion 
potential TCR combinations capable of reacting to non-self and self peptides Since the advent of 
next generation sequencing NGS techniques the TCR repertoire as expressed by TCR  clonal 
frequency has revealed that the T cell repertoire in healthy individuals is complex with thousands of 
clones in each individual spanning a spectrum of high and low frequencies 4 5  
T cells have a fundamental role in clinical medicine especially in cancer therapeutics As an example 
clinical outcomes following stem cell transplantation SCT are closely associated with T cell 
reconstitution both from the standpoint of infection control and control of malignancy 67 A detailed 
examination of transplant outcomes in the context of immune reconstitution suggests that the T cell 
recovery is a dynamic and ordered progression of events which follows mathematically quantifiable 
rules In other words T cell reconstitution over time following SCT may be considered as a dynamical

system where each of the successive states of the system T cell repertoire complexity when plotted as 
a function of time can be described mathematically as a non-random process 8 9 Consistent with this 
hypothesis T cell repertoire has been shown to posses a fractal self-similar organization with respect to 
TCR gene segment usage 10  
Clinical  outcomes  following  SCT  have  been  studied  using  probability  theory  assuming  that  the 
outcomes  are  inherently  random  within  specific  constraints  such  as  HLA-matching  and  intensity  of 
immunosuppression However the dynamical system model of immune reconstitution implies that T cell 
repertoire  generation  and  thus  clinical  outcomes  tied  to  it  is  not  a  stochastic  process  but  a 
mathematically definable one Since the T cell repertoire is dependent on the clones generated by TCR 
gene  rearrangement  it  may  be  postulated  that  the  TCR  locus  may  exhibit  organizational  features 
reflected in the resulting T cell repertoire It has been observed that the T cell clonal repertoire follows 
power  laws  and  demonstrates  self-similarity  across  scales  of  measurement  which  are  features  of 
fractals  Fractal  geometry  represents  iterating  functions  which  result  in  structures  demonstrating 
organizational self-similarity across scales of magnitude Mathematically self-similarity is characterized 
by the logarithm of magnitude of a parameter y maintaining a relatively constant ratio to the logarithm 
of a scaling factor value x this ratio is termed fractal-dimension FD 11 FD takes on non-integer 
values between the classical Euclidean integer dimensional values Self-similarity is a structural motif 
widely  observed  in  nature  albeit  on  a  limited  scale  such  as  in  the  branching  patterns  of  trees  or  of 
vascular and neuronal networks in animals 12 13 14 15 Fractal organization has also been described 
in terms of molecular folding of DNA and in nucleotide distribution in the genome 16 17 18 19 In 
such  instances  fractal  dimension  explains  the  complex  structural  organization  of  natural  objects  A 
germ-line linear strand of DNA such as the TCR locus rearranged to yield new complex patterns may 
be  similarly  considered  In  this  case  the  recombination  of  TCR  V  D  and  J  segments  and  NI  lends 
complexity to the rearranged locus compared to its native state The resulting T cell repertoire with its 
many unique T cell clones may then be considered to have a fractal organization if the frequency of T 
cell clones with unique D DJ VDJ and VDJNI segments are considered sequentially at an increasing 
level of clonal definition Using such analyses the T cell repertoire appears highly ordered with respect 
to  TCR    VDJ  gene  segment  usage  demonstrating  self-similarity  in  terms  of  clonal  frequency  at 
multiple levels of clonal definition When the number of TCR segments used to define a clone is used as 
the scaling factor a consistent fractal dimension value of 16 15 and 14 is observed across normal stem 
cell donors when TCR clone families bearing unique J VJ and VJNI are evaluated 10 It stands to 
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
reason that the TCR loci which generate this T cell clonal diversity should be organized in a similar 
manner to result in a repertoire so ordered 
The universal constants  and e have a role in defining the fractal dimension of the T cell repertoire 
which would then imply that the TCR locus may be arranged in conformity with these constants and 
posses self-similarity as well as periodic characteristics An inspection of the known sequence of the 
TCR loci with attention to V and J gene segment size and spacing supports this notion In this paper an 
examination of the TCR  and  loci in light of e and  is presented supporting the hypothesis that TCR 
locus organization may influence T cell repertoire The findings reported here support the hypothesis 
that the T cell repertoire is not a randomly generated set of T cell clones rather it is the result of a 
deterministic process dependent on TCR gene segment distribution on the individual loci   
Methods  
Human T cell receptor loci 
Data on the TCR  TRA and  TRB loci were obtained from the NCBI using the public database 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovnuccore114841177reportgraph 
httpwwwncbinlmnihgovnuccore99345462reportgraph Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 The 
graphic format with locus identification was utilized Data examined included the position of the initial 
start and final stop nucleotides of all the TCR gene segments beginning from the 5 end of the locus 
and going to the 3 end Segment length was taken from the NCBI data-base and spacing between 
consecutive segments was calculated by taking the difference between the numeric value of the final 
nucleotide or base pair  xf position of a gene segment and the initial nucleotide position xi of the 
following segment Supplementary table 1 and 2 In the ensuing calculations numeric data were either 
considered without any modification or transformed to natural logarithms to eliminate the effect of 
relative magnitude between the variables being examined and also to allow comparisons across 
different scales eg segment size in hundreds or tens of nucleotides versus inter-segment spacing in the 
thousands or hundreds of nucleotides respectively Microsoft Excel version 1425 software was used 
to perform various calculations presented in this paper   
Gene Segment Distribution on the TCR Locus  
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
To investigate the possible fractal nature of the TCR locus analysis of gene segment distribution was 
performed utilizing the relationship between magnitude and scaling factor across varying levels of 
magnification The resulting fractal dimension FD is described as follows 
FD  Log magnitude  Log scaling factor 
To determine the fractal dimension of the TCR loci the FD was calculated analogous to the calculation 
of the fractal dimension of a Von Koch curve the length of the gene segment in number of nucleotides 
or base pairs was considered as a scaling factor and the length of the inter-segment space also in 
nucleotide number as the magnitude of the line segment This calculation was performed individually 
for each segment to fully account for variability observed 
TRB locus Periodicity 
The TCR gene segments occur periodically from the 5 to the 3 end of the loci with V D in TRB J and 
C segments in that order For the calculations regarding the gene segment periodicity and its influence 
on  gene  usage  frequency  the  helical  DNA  molecules  were  considered  as  a  propagating  spiral  or  a 
wave In this model each base-pair on a strand of DNA may be considered as a point x with subsequent 
base pairs x1 xn being successive points on the spiral as opposed to points on a straight number 
line The spiral or helical DNA molecule as it executes one turn goes through 2 radians in terms of 
angular distance spanned One turn of the helix contains 104 nucleotides 20 so the space between 
successive  nucleotides  may  be  considered  as  angular  distance  in  radians  between  them  assuming  a 
uniform  unit  radius  of  the  DNA  molecule  This  inter-nucleotide  distance  will  be  2104 
Supplementary Figure 1 The spatial position of any nucleotide x relative to the locus origin may be 
then be described as the angular distance in radians 2x104 radians and its coordinates on the DNA 
molecule determined  
T cell clonal frequency 
Stem cell donor samples for determining T cell clonal frequency were obtained as part of a clinical trial 
approved by the institutional review board at Virginia Commonwealth University ClinicalTrialsgov 
Identifier NCT00709592 As previously described CD3 cells were isolated from stem cell transplant 
donor samples and cDNA synthesized from these cells 10 The cDNA was then sent to Adaptive 
Biotechnologies Seattle WA for high-throughput sequencing of the TCR  CDR3 region using the 
ImmunoSEQ assay This approach is comprised of a multiplex PCR and sequencing assay in 
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
combination with algorithmic methods to produce approximately 1000000 TCR  CDR3 sequences per 
sample 21 The assay utilized 52 forward primers for the V gene segment and 13 reverse primers for 
the J segment to generate a 60 base pair fragment capable of identifying the entire unique VDJ 
combination 22  Amplicons were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform and data was 
analyzed using the ImmunoSEQ analyzer set of tools This approach enables direct sequencing of a 
significant fraction of the TCR repertoire as well as permitting estimation of the relative frequency of 
each CDR3 region in the population  
Results  
Self-similarity of the TCR loci  
Sequences of the TCR  TRA and  TRB loci were examined and the position of the initial start 
and final stop nucleotides of the TCR gene segments beginning from the 5 end of the locus and going 
to the 3 end were recorded Segment length was taken from the NCBI data-base and spacing between 
consecutive segments was calculated Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 Self-similarity across the T cell 
receptor  and  loci was first examined by deriving the fractal dimension of these loci To accomplish 
this the spacing of all the V and J segments across the  and  loci was determined in numbers of 
nucleotides along the DNA molecule and the natural logarithms of these values calculated Given the 
relative uniformity of sizes in nucleotides for the V and J gene segments these were considered as a 
scaling  parameter  for  determining  the  fractal  dimension  of  the  TCR  loci  FD-TCR  The  sizes  of 
neighboring segments and intersegment spaces were used in the FD-TCR calculations to avoid bias The 
following formula was used 
FD-TCR  Log Intron length following nth TCR seg  Log Length nth TCR seg     1 
Relatively consistent values of FD-TCR were observed across the distribution of the V and J segments 
for both the TCR  and  loci Figure 1 when the calculated fractal dimensions were plotted across the 
loci This indicates that when viewed on a logarithmic scale there is uniformity in the distribution of 
gene segments both within and between the different TCR loci a hallmark of self-similar systems The 
average FD-TCR of the TRB V and J segments were 1401 and 1302 respectively Corresponding 
values for TRA locus were 1501 and 1701 for the V and J segments The self-similarity across the 
TRA locus may also be seen when the spacing between successive gene segments is plotted from the 5 
to 3 end in a circular area graph Figure 2 The two halves of the figure are similar in appearance and

are  symmetric  except  for  the  spacing  between  TRA-J  segments  being  an  order  of  magnitude  lower 
when compared with TRA-V segments Notably oscillation around a central value is observed in these 
graphics  suggesting  that  periodic  variation  is  present  in  the  measured  parameters  Despite  this 
variability  the  narrow  distribution  of  the  FD-TCR  values  was  consistent  with  self-similarity  in  the 
organization across the V and J segments of the two TCR loci examined This implies that the size of the 
interval between successive T cell gene segments is proportional to the size of the gene segment It may 
be  postulated  that  this  phenomenon  exerts  an  influence  on  the  order  of  TCR  gene  rearrangement 
specifically the D to J and DJ or J to V or V recombination  
In calculating FD-TCR the D and C segments were not considered because of their infrequent and non-
periodic occurrence as well as their being interspersed between other loci However notably their size 
followed fixed proportion to the sizes of J and V segments respectively such that D segments were 13 
to  14  the  size  of  J  and  the  C  segments  were  approximately  3  times  the  length  of  the  V  segments 
Similarly  the  TCR-  locus  was  also  not  evaluated  because  of  the  small  number  of  gene  segments 
however it is to be noted that the gene segment length was similar to the TRA and TRB loci  
Logarithmic Distribution of V segments with respect to D and J segments 
During T cell receptor recombination the J and the D segments in TRA and TRB loci respectively are 
recombined  with  the  V  segments  The  distribution  of  V  segments  in  the  TRA  and  TRB  loci  was 
therefore  examined  relative  to  the  position  of  the  J  and  the  D  loci  respectively  to  discern  if  any 
organizational order was evident The relative position of V loci was calculated with respect to the two 
D loci for TRB and selected J loci for TRA by the using a formula considering the 5-initial nucleotide 
positions xi of the D or J gene segments and the final 3 nucleotide position of the V segments xf 
from the origin of the locus  
Relative recombination distance Vn  xi-D or J segment  xf nth V segment         
     2 
Relative recombination distance RRD demonstrated a consistent proportionality in the distribution of 
V segments across both TRA and TRB loci When RRD for successive TRB V loci was plotted in order 
of occurrence on the locus the value declined as a logarithmic function of V segment rank with a slope 
of 16 for the TRB locus Figure 3A and 13 for the TRA locus Figure 3B  3C values very close to 
the FD-TCR These calculations demonstrate that the V segments are spaced from their respective D and 
J segments in a logarithmically proportional manner This is consistent with the self-similar nature of the 
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
TCR  loci  as  seen  in  the  preceding  calculations  and  also  validates  the  notion  that  the  distribution  of 
various gene segments on the TRA and TRB loci is not random but rather follows a mathematically 
determined order apparent when logarithmic transformation is used    
Logarithmic scaling of the TCR gene segment periodicity 
Repetitive occurrence of gene segments on the TCR loci as well as the fluctuation of FD-TCR about the 
average value Figure 1 suggested that they conform to a periodic distribution analogous to the periodic 
behavior  exhibited  by  phenomenon  such  as  wave  motion  or  in  this  case  helixspiral  progression  To 
examine the periodicity of the relative positions of gene segments on the TCR loci they were considered 
as  successive  nucleotide  sequences  on  the  DNA  helix  and  the  angular  distance  between  segments 
determined by using the relationship 2x104 where x is the initial or final nucleotide position in a gene 
segment with respect to the TCR locus origin Supplementary Figure 1 The calculated angular distance 
between  the  gene  segments  were  further  analyzed  by  determining  the  distance  between  V  and  D 
segment in TRB  
These values were then used to determine the coordinates of the gene segments on the DNA helix using 
the trigonometric parameters sine and cosine for the initial nucleotides xi relative to the locus origin 
When this was done for the angular distance 2x104 and the resulting sine and cosine values plotted 
against the angular distance f x  Sin 2x104 or Cos 2x104 from locus origin no clear pattern 
was observed with the sine and cosine values for each of the positions distributed randomly along the 
DNA  strand  Figure  4A  Given  the  previously  observed  logarithmic  ordering  of  the  TCR  loci  the 
trigonometric functions of the natural logarithm of 5-initial nucleotides angular distance from the locus 
origin  Sin Log 2x104 and Cos Log 2x104 were  then  plotted  against  the  angular  distance 
This  demonstrated  that  the  TCR  gene  segments  were  positioned  on  the  locus  in  a  sequential  aligned 
manner Figure 4B for both the TRA and TRB loci when the log-periodic functions of the nucleotide 
positions are considered Further when the TRA and TRB sine and cosine plots were overlaid these 
plots were superimposable supporting the earlier observation regarding the self-similar nature of these 
loci Figure 4C These calculated trigonometric functions of TCR gene segments reveal that these loci 
have a log-periodic nature  
T cell clonal frequency and its correlation with TRB gene segments   
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
The periodic nature of the TCR gene segments on the locus from an evolutionary standpoint may be the 
result of TCR locus generation being an iterative process which would be a logical conclusion given its 
role in adaptive immunity of an organism To determine whether the periodicity of the TCR loci was 
reflected in the T cell clonal frequency high throughput TRB sequencing data from 3 normal stem cell 
transplant  donors  was  used  Clonal  frequency  for  unique  TRB  V  and  TRB  J  segments  was  plotted 
against the angular distance in radians between the 5 initial-nucleotide 2xi  104 of the TRB-D1  
TRB-D2 and the 3 final-nucleotide 2xf  104 of the V segments or the 5 start nucleotide of the J 
segments  The  T  cell  clonal  frequency  varied  as  a  quasi-periodic  function  of  the  angular  distance 
between both TRB-D1 and D2 and the successive TRB-V segments oscillating between high and low 
clonal  frequency  values  Figure  5A  For  the  TRB-V  clonal  families  the  peaks  of  clonal  frequency 
occurred approximately every 50000-60000 radians going in the 5 direction from the D loci Further 
the  two  J  segment  bearing  areas  of  the  TRB  locus  were  approximately  5000  radians  apart  in  the  3 
direction  and  demonstrated  oscillating  clonal  frequency  Figure  5B  This  finding  was  consistent 
between  unrelated  stem  cell  donors  demonstrating  very  high  expression  levels  for  some  loci 
intermediate  for  others  and  low  or  no  expression  in  others  Supplementary  Figure  2  This  may  be 
interpreted as TCR gene V segment functional recombination probability amplitudes oscillating between 
0 no recombination and 1 very frequent recombination resulting in high clonal frequency across the 
locus    
Discussion  
The germ-line genomic T cell receptor and immunoglobulin loci have the unique characteristic in that 
these can undergo DNA double strand break and recombination resulting in VDJ rearrangement which 
results in the generation of numerous unique T cell clones with the ability to identify the wide array of 
antigens In recent years new insights have been gained into the mechanism of this very ordered 
sequence of DNA rearrangement This process results in a very large repertoire of immune effectors 
which is employed therapeutically in modalities such as SCT Clinical outcomes following 
transplantation in particular and immune therapies in general have been modeled as stochastic 
processes However recently a dynamical system model for immunological responses has been 
proposed This model postulates that immune responses are not stochastic but are predictable and 
accurately quantifiable as they evolve over time In support of this T cell repertoire has been recognized 
as possessing characteristics of self-similar systems and following power law distributions If the T cell 
repertoire is non-random and describable in mathematical terms it is logical that T cell gene 
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
rearrangement contributes to the emergence of this order This would imply that the TCR locus 
organization lends itself to a mathematically quantifiable gene rearrangement process In this 
manuscript quantitative uniformities are explored across the TCR loci and their potential role in 
shaping the T cell repertoire investigated 
T cell receptor rearrangement is a strictly ordered process with the sequence of recombinatorial events 
governed by a numeric so-called 1223 rule Considering the example of the T cell receptor  the V 
D and J segments are flanked by conserved sequences called recombination signal sequences RSS 
comprised of a heptameric and a nonameric sequence which are interposed by either a 12 RSS-12 or a 
23 RSS-23 base pair sequence VDJ rearrangement is brought about by recombinase-activating gene-1 
RAG-1 and RAG-2 protein complexes which always bring together segments with a RSS 12 with a 
segment flanked by a RSS-23 not otherwise Considering the TRB D segments are flanked by the 
RSS sequences on both sides 5 RSS-12 and 3 RSS-23 J segments on the 5 end RSS-12 and V 
segments on the 3 end RSS-23 23 In the series of events set off during T cell development initially 
a D segment rearranges with one of the J segments then the combined DJ joins with a specific V 
segment to result in VDJ rearrangement yielding a unique T cell clone Similar considerations hold for 
TCR where J recombines with V with the additional possibility of locus editing such that 
alternative 5 V may be rearranged to an alternative 3 J segment at a later time 24 As elegant as 
this system is it does not completely explain either how the order of recombination is determined or 
what determines the variability in the use of various TCR gene segments encountered in the T cell 
repertoire for instance why does the D RSS-23 preferentially rearrange with J RSS-12 and not the 
D RSS-12 with the V RSS-23 and why are clones with TRB V5-1 encountered much more 
frequently than TRB V5-4 in the normal T cell repertoire Further in the TRD TCR- locus 
rearrangement under normal circumstances there is strict regulation such that TRA and TRD segments 
do not recombine with each other despite the TRD locus being nested within the TRA locus However 
when a TRA-J segment is ectopically introduced in the TRD locus at the TRD-D segment position 
rearrangement of this ectopic TRA-J with TRD-V segments occurs demonstrating that locus position 
rather than the actual sequence may have a deterministic role in the order of recombination 25 This 
raises the question of whether there are further structural motifs on the DNA molecule which determine 
the order of recombination  It is this question that the log-periodic nature of the TCR locus elucidated 
in our analysis may help answer   
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
In nature there is a tendency for organizational patterns to be repeated over different scales of 
measurement and for such patterns to be observed across different systems Fractal organization in the 
VDJ segment usage in the T cell repertoire of normal individuals has been observed with the diversity 
joining and variable gene segment usage defining a virtual structure that results from recombination of 
the T cell  receptor locus 10 26 27 With this background the proportions between the V and J 
segment size and inter-segment intron lengths were examined relative to each other and were found to 
be similar It is likely that the proportional distribution of V and J segment size and spacing between 
individual segments fractal organization in this instance serves to order the ensuing rearrangement 
process In essence the V segments are similar in their organization to the J segment and from an 
evolutionary standpoint the V segment sequence represents a logarithmically magnified version of the J 
segment sequence This may explain why in the order of gene segment rearrangement D to J and DJ 
or J to V segments RAG complexes are always directed from the shorter closely spaced J 
segments to the longer more dispersed V segments such that the reverse does not transpire in the course 
of normal recombination Further the logarithmic scaling implies that the distribution of these size-
ordered segments is always similar in their respective sections of the TCR locus which ensures that 
RAG complexes do not have to scan an entire sequence of nucleotides to randomly encounter a coding 
segment but can potentially align with relevant segments skipping over given lengths of intronic 
material This would then provide an additional mechanism to complement the 1223 rule and to ensure 
fidelity of recombination Presumably the epigenetic mechanisms such as RAG2 interacting with 
methylated of histone3-K4 further facilitates the navigation along the TCR loci to make the process a 
model of efficiency Conformational changes in the locus which bring V segments in apposition to J 
segments may also be dictated by the logarithmic relationship This hypothesis if true suggests that the 
origin of the fractal organization of the T cell repertoire is within the arrangement of the TCR loci 
resulting in an ordered recombination process The log-periodic nature of other fractal phenomenon 
encountered in nature supports this postulate 28 29  
High-throughput sequencing of TRB has demonstrated a differential representation of the different gene 
segments in the T cell clonal repertoire indicating that some sequences are used at a higher frequency 
than others 3 4 10 This has been observed for TCR as well as TCR and has been seen for both J 
and V segments 30 This recombination bias affects both in-frame and out-of-frame recombined 
sequences suggesting that it is not a consequence of thymic selection nor HLA restriction rather is a 
result of recombinatorial usage bias or ranking of various segments Figure 4 demonstrates this 
phenomenon and it is also reflected in the power law distribution of the final T cell clonal distribution 
On the organization of T cell receptor loci Toor A Toor A Manjili M 
observed The relationship between TCR locus organization and segment selection in this rearrangement 
process and its impact on the T cell repertoire generation has been a focus of intensive study in the 
recent years Recently a biophysical model describing yeast chromosome conformation has been applied 
to the murine TCR D and -J segment and the derived model based on genomic distance between 
these segments has partially recapitulated the observed bias in J segment usage 31 This strengthens 
the notion that chromatin conformation has a formative role in the T cell repertoire generation 
Regardless of the mechanism of recombination it has become obvious that the T cell repertoire that 
emerges has a biased VDJ segment usage with certain segments being used more frequently than 
others This suggests that these segments may be more efficiently rearranged resulting in their over 
representation in the repertoire and vice versa Could this in part be a function of the intrinsic position 
of the segment on the DNA strand versus being entirely determined by extrinsic factors such as 
epigenetic influence and segment localization on the chromosome 
Given the emergence of the constant  in the equations describing the fractal nature of the T cell 
repertoire in normal stem cell donors and the periodic nature of TCR gene segments on the TCR locus 
their relative positions were examined using trigonometric functions to account for the helical nature of 
DNA Similarity was observed in the relative location of the V D and J segments across the TRA and 
TRB loci when they were examined using logarithmic scaling with increasingly complex waveforms 
observed as higher order harmonics were evaluated data not shown There are several important 
implications of this observation First analogous to the phenomenon of superposition constructive or 
destructive interference observed in the mechanical and electromagnetic waves one may consider that 
relative position of a particular segment reflected by the sine and cosine functions and angular distance 
from the rearranging segment D or J may influence its usage in repertoire generation resulting in 
the periodic distribution of the V and J segment usage in T cell clones when the locus is interrogated 
from the 5 to 3 end Essentially this means that using analytic techniques such as Fouriers series 
probability amplitudes may be determined for the various gene segments on the TCR loci based on their 
positions It may be very likely that the recombination is most frequent for gene segments that occur at a 
certain harmonic frequency As an example in the data presented the TRB-V segment clonal frequency 
appears to oscillate with a wavelength of 50-60000 radians from the TRB-D segment It may be 
speculated that the gene segment distribution periods represent optimal energy distribution for 
recombination to occur on the long helical DNA molecule analogous to the interference phenomenon 
encountered in wave mechanics This is plausible because the DNA double helices may represent two 
superposed waves and the gene segment location may lend itself to either constructive or destructive

interference impacting the interaction with RAG genes and recombination potential This would in turn 
determine the probability amplitude of that gene segment being represented in the final T cell clonal 
repertoire Figure 6 
In this hypothetical paper we demonstrate that the TCR loci have an iterative logarithmically scaled 
periodic nature when the gene segment distribution is considered This means that with minimal 
genomic material an organism may efficiently generate a vast receptor array protecting the organism 
from populations of antigenically diverse pathogens it is likely to encounter in its lifetime Secondly 
nature has a tendency to be conservative in terms of using the same basic processes with minor variation 
in different settings to generate variability observed The data presented here make it possible to 
consider variations in DNA expression as a partial function of the wave-mechanical properties of the 
DNA double helix Further it may be postulated that if self-similarity is true for the distribution of gene 
segments within a locus than it is likely to be true for the genome as a whole and the distribution of 
exons and introns in the genome may be similarly considered The expression of these genes may then 
be determined by the sum of the harmonics of the relevant genes and be predictable using Fourier 
analysis This work demonstrates that the T cell receptor loci and by extension the T cell receptor 
repertoire is not an accident of nature a result of random mutations rather it is a mathematically ordered 
iterative process In essence evolution of the immune system conferring a survival advantage to 
organisms in higher order phyla These findings strengthen the argument that immune responses such as 
following SCT represents an example of an ordered dynamical systems and not a stochastic process

A TRB-V clonal frequency demonstrates quasi-periodicity irregular as a function of angular distance between 
TRB-D1 and successive TRB-V segments from V29 to V1 This represents periodic fluctuation in functional 
recombination probability amplitude across the locus B TRB-J clonal frequency as a function of the angular 
distance between TRB-D1 and successive TRB-J segments Both X and Y-axis magnitude different by 
approximately an order of magnitude one-log between the two graphs

Figure 6 A model depicting T cell receptor organization and its influence on gene segment recombination 
probability TCR V segments are separated by long intervals J segments by shorter intervals dashed lines the 
ratio of log segment length to log spacing is approximately 14 for V segments and 13 for J segments Relative 
interval between successive V segments and the J segments in the TRA locus top blue curve declines 
logarithmically with a slope of 13  Sine and cosine function value of the start nucleotides of each V segment 
extrapolated to the sense green and antisense blue DNA strands demonstrate that the gene segments are 
accurately aligned once the logarithmic organization is accounted for Hypothetically the segment location on the 
two DNA helices being in-phase or out-of-phase may impact the energetics of DNA-RAG enzyme interaction and 
thus the probability amplitude orange line going from 0 to 1 for gene segment recombination analogous to 
wave interference phenomenon In the model depicted V1 location on the two helices is out of phase V2 is 
partially in phase and V3 is completely in phase Closely clustered together J segments are more likely to be in 
phase
