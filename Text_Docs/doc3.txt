Abstract. The evolution of Lyα absorber counts is simulated for a
model population of absorbing galaxies. The distribution of gas relative to
galaxies could evolve between moderate and low redshifts, but constraints
are needed on the strength and evolution of the ionizing UV background.
Lyα absorber observations at low to moderate redshifts constrain the evo-
lution in the distribution of gas relative to galaxies. Absorber counts gener-
ally decrease with decreasing redshifts, although the decrease is less rapid at
redshifts less than ∼ 1.5 (Weymann et al. 1998). Such evolution has been ex-
plained by Dav´e et al. (1999) as largely the result of the decreasing UV ionizing
background, assuming an ionization history based upon spectra from Haardt &
Madau (1996). The evolution in Lyα absorber counts (> 1014.3 cm−2) is shown
in Fig. 1, where I assume that such absorbers arise in galaxies at redshift z = 0
as simulated in Linder (2000) and Linder (1998). It is also assumed that at at
each simulated redshift a population of galaxies with the same gaseous prop-
erties exists, and that the ionizing background radiation evolves as in Dav´e et
al. (1999). At higher redshifts weaker absorbers are included, assuming that
absorbers at a given column density correspond to a smaller overdensity at a
higher redshift, as shown in Fig. 10 of Dav´e et al. Reproducing the observed
evolution at high redshifts will require understanding both the cosmology and
the large scale process of formation of gas into galaxies. Yet it is interesting to
look at the evolution of absorber counts due to galaxies at the lowest redshifts.
While qualitatively similar evolution (steeper at higher redshifts) is seen here as
in Weymann et al. (1998), one curious feature in this model is that the absorber
counts increase from z = 0.5 to z = 0.
What could be happening in this redshift range? In the simulations illus-
trated in Fig. 1 it is assumed that the total (neutral plus ionized) gaseous extent
of galaxies remains constant with redshift. There could be evolution as a result
of the formation process of gas into galaxies, although it seems surprising that
so much formation would be happening at z < 0.5. It is also possible that there
are as many nongalactic absorbers at z ∼ 0.5 as at z ∼ 0, where a given absorber
is more weakly associated with a galaxy yet more highly ionized. In this case
no evolution might be detected in the gaseous extent of galaxies, as for example
Chen et al. (2000). Another possibility is that the UV ionizing background could
decrease less quickly than estimated from the Haardt & Madau (1996) models.

redshift is shown versus redshift. All absorbers at z ∼ 0 are assumed to
arise in gas extending from galaxy disks. Absorber counts may actually
increase after z ∼ 0.5 unless the ionizing background decreases more
slowly or the average gaseous extent of galaxies decreases rapidly.
This seems plausible as only quasars are included in their spectra, while some
evidence is seen that gas surrounding galaxies is ionized by the galaxies them-
selves (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 1997). Yet it is likely that there is some evolution
in the UV ionizing background and in the observable properties of galaxies, so
that a more complex evolutionary process is happening than that reported by
Chen et al. (2000). One possibility is that absorber counts actually do increase
at z ∼ 0, where it is most diﬃcult to get an adequate sample of absorption line
data. In this case there would be more HI in the local universe than what we
have been extrapolating from absorber counts at slightly higher redshifts.
The nature of absorbers could change quickly between moderate and low
redshifts, but at this time we know little about the strength or evolution of the
ionizing UV background. The strength of this background typically changes
rapidly in simulations over the range of z ∼ 0 to 0.8, where observers tend to
look for the averaged relationship between galaxies and ‘low redshift’ absorbers.
