Abstract The evolution of galaxies results from a combination of internal and external 
processes The star formation is an internal process transforming cold and dense cores of 
molecular clouds to stars It may be triggered internally by expanding shells or externally 
eg  by  galaxy  collisions  The  gas  accretion  and  galaxy  merging  events  are  external 
contributors to galaxy evolution They compete with another internal process of galaxy 
evolution which is the secular evolution redistributing the mass and angular momentum 
inside of galaxies as a consequence of bar and spiral arms formation As a nearby example 
of  gas  accretion  we  mention  the  interacting  system  Milky  Way    Large  and  Small 
Magellanic Clouds Stripping of ISM in galaxy clusters is reviewed as another example of 
interaction of galaxies with their environment

1  INTRODUCTION 
Galaxies are composed of stars interstellar matter ISM and dark matter DM 
While the DM dominates galaxies gravitationally the first two components produce 
photons that are detected with the telescopes As an example of a gas-rich system we 
refer to the spiral galaxy NGC 1350 It shows the ISM in the disk with spiral arms 
reaching from the periphery to the very center of it On the other hand the elliptical 
galaxy M87 is composed mostly from stars without any gaseous disk In spiral disk 
galaxies we observe the star formation changing ISM into stars At the same time 
stars return a fraction of their mass to the ISM This gas recycling inserts the heavy 
elements  products  of  nuclear  fusion  in  stars  into  the  ISM  causing  the  chemical 
evolution of galaxies  
Formation and evolution of galaxies is a complex process the mass arrives to 
galaxies in an accretion process or in merging events when smaller systems meet in 
groups The gravitational forces exchange energies between different parts of colliding 
systems As a result a fraction of mass originally bound in smaller galaxies gets

positive  energy  and  leaves  the  system  while  the  remaining  parts  become  more 
gravitationally bound The star formation is enhanced during the merging events a 
galaxy collision brings fresh gas to the galaxy central parts where it triggers star 
formation 
While the main part of mass in disks of spiral galaxies is accreted in the form of 
cold gas the majority of DM in clusters is acquired from mergers between DM galaxy 
haloes A fraction of the primordial gas and the gas that is released from galaxies in 
merging events in gas stripping and due to star formation feedback resides in the 
intergalactic space of galaxy clusters forming intracluster medium ICM 
A part of the galactic evolution is due to internal processes such as formation of 
spiral arms in rotating disks and evolution of bars in galaxy central regions As an 
example of a barred spiral galaxy we refer to NGC 1365 It has two distinct spiral 
arms and the large central bar The formation of bars and spirals will be discussed as a 
result of internal secular evolution of galaxy disks 
Star  formation  is  another  process  of  internal  galaxy  evolution  It  produces 
individual stars binaries or multiple stellar systems it propagates in a turbulent ISM 
where it is governed by different triggering mechanisms Star formation transforms 
molecular clouds to expanding OB associations or to more stable open star clusters 
The original cloud is dispersed due to action of the star formation feedback young 
stars produce intensive stellar winds and UV radiation penetrating the parent cloud 
Formation of massive stable and long-living stellar systems such as globular clusters 
needs some mechanism able to eliminate the dispersive action of the star formation 
feedback Galaxy interaction may play a role in massive star cluster formation since 
massive super-star clusters which are the young progenitors of globular clusters form 
preferentially in tidal arms or in the overlapping regions created when galaxies collide 
In  this  review  I  will  first  focus  on  formation  of  stars  and  star  clusters  in 
molecular clouds later I will describe evolution of galaxies due to gas accretion 
mergers  and  secular  evolution  then  I  will  describe  gas  accretion  and  galaxy 
interactions  near  to  the  Milky  Way  and  finally  I  will  discuss  the  interaction  of 
individual galaxies with ICM in clusters This provides only an incomplete picture of 
the  galaxy  evolution  some  more  and  complementary  information  is  provided  by 
Palou 2005 
2  STAR  FORMATION  IN  THE  ISM 
Star formation is an important process of the internal galactic evolution Stars 
are formed in cold dense cores of molecular clouds However star formation may be 
triggered  due  to  internal  reasons  such  as  the  star  formation  feedback  or  due  to 
external reasons such as the galaxy collisions We shall first discuss the star formation 
on its small scale inside of molecular clouds later we shall mention different actions 
The Evolution of Galaxies 
of triggering producing star formation patterns on larger scales 
Elmegreen 2007 describes the collapse and evolution of molecular clouds 
which  are  hierarchical  structures  resulting  from  turbulence  and  self-gravity  The 
evolution of a molecular cloud has two different aspects a fast collapse of its densest 
parts into stars binaries or small stellar groups and a slow and long lasting dispersal 
of their low-density envelopes There in the envelopes the next stellar generation may 
form due to triggering by energy and mass inserted by previous stellar generations 
The  detailed  SPH  simulations  of  the  collapse  inside  a  molecular  cloud  are 
presented by Stamatellos et al 2007 they consider the radiative transfer which has 
an important influence on sizes of the resulting fragments Kitsionas and Whitworth 
2007 consider the case of a collision between dense clumps The protostellar objects 
condense from filaments they accrete their mass out of them The effect of ionization 
due to radiation emitted by young stars is discussed by Dale et al 2007 and Mac 
Low et al 2007 The expanding HII regions collect mass in post-shock layers where 
the star formation may be triggered This collect and collapse model creates numerous 
self-gravitating  fragments  particularly  if  the  surrounding  cloud  is  turbulent  The 
fragmentation times in their simulations correspond to theoretical predictions from the 
analysis of the expanding shell by Elmegreen 1994 and Whitworth et al 1994 This 
proves that the dominant processes are mass accretion and stretching of isothermal 
cold thin layers 
Stars emerge always in small filamentary groups which later merge into star 
clusters There is mounting evidence on non-coeval star formation in clusters The 
structure of a cloud and its mass segregation is governed by the initial morphology 
producing  the  primordial  mass  segregation  rather  than  resulting  from  later 
relaxations Sharma et al 2007 Chen et al 2007 What could be the origin of this 
early mass fragmentation Whitworth et al 1994 argued that high-mass stars form 
preferentially in compressed gas layers This could lead to an opposite conclusion 
since there should be more triggering by expanding shells on the periphery compared 
to the cloud center The fragmentation to smaller parts in higher density places of an 
isothermal  cloud  compared  to  lower  density  places  leads  also  to  a  conclusion 
opposite to observation The explanation can be in the difference between the 3D 
collapse in the cloud center where the density is high but still less compared to shells 
and the 2D collapse in thin cold shells where the collect and collapse principle works 
there in shells is the volume density higher compared to the cloud center which is 
why  the  fragmentation  process  produces  smaller  fragments  in  shells  at  the  cloud 
periphery compared to the 3D collapse in the cloud central parts 
Formation of massive stellar clusters globular clusters and super star-clusters 
which  are  composed  of  a  million  stars  or  more  is  a  challenging  problem  in 
astrophysics To save the parental cloud from being dispersed the star formation 
feedback inserting energy and mass into the star forming clouds needs to be stopped It 
should increase the star formation efficiency to a high value since the molecular cloud 
Jan PALOU 
has to be transformed into stars almost completely  
Tenorio-Tagle et al 2003 proposed the following scenario the winds and 
radiation  of  the  first  generation  of  stars  in  the  molecular  cloud  center  creates  an 
expanding shell which propagates into the rest of the collapsing molecular cloud At 
certain  distance  from  the  cloud  center  the  shell  stops  expanding  It  gradually 
accumulates the outer parts of the collapsing molecular cloud it fragments producing 
stars of the super star-cluster 
The hydrodynamics of the stellar wind released by young stars into the volume 
of a super star-cluster is discussed by Tenorio-Tagle et al 2007 and Wunsch et al 
2007 For given cluster radius above threshold luminosity the wind is thermally 
unstable It produces dense and cold clumps which may be the places of further star 
formation This increases the fraction of the original cloud that is transformed to stars 
The emerging super star-cluster is stable it may become the progenitor of a globular 
cluster 
Why galaxy collisions trigger the formation of super star-clusters along the tidal 
arms  Molecular  clouds  are  marginally  stable  in  an  environment  with  certain 
pressure their self-gravity is in a balance with random motions and galactic tides A 
galaxy  collision  triggers  their  collapse  due  to  increased  external  pressure  in  the 
molecular cloud environment Jog  Solomon 1992 Another triggering factor may 
be the decrease of tidal fields along tidal arms created by the interaction Palou et al 
2004 This hypothesis should be checked with velocity fields of interacting galaxies 
such as NGC 66212 or NGC 57524 
3  GAS  ACCRETION  MERGERS  AND  SECULAR  EVOLUTION  OF  GALAXIES 
The evolution of galaxies is a combination of external processes such as cold 
gas accretion from intergalactic spaces or hierarchical merging of small irregular and 
disk galaxies in clusters with internal processes such as the galaxy secular evolution 
redistributing mass and angular momentum in galaxies or star formation Cold gas 
accretion which in the CDM model of the expanding universe Gnedin 2003 occurs 
preferentially along the large scale filaments of the mass distribution is able to build 
up the galaxy disks They are the subjects of later secular evolution Hierarchical 
merging of small irregular and disk galaxies in groups and clusters produce larger 
elliptical  galaxies  where  the  strongly  rotating  disks  are  absent  Merging  applies 
particularly to collisionless dark matter when it combines and builds the gravitational 
potential of a galaxy cluster Secular evolution of the disks forms bars and spiral arms 
and gradually builds up central mass concentrations CMCs 
The galaxy growth by accretion is described by Semelin and Combes 2005 
According to their simulations accretion dominates the galaxy growth by a factor 2 to 
4 over the mass gained through mergers In the case of field galaxies is this fraction 
The Evolution of Galaxies 
even higher The dominance of the accretion applies more to z  2 and decreases from 
4 times to 2 times between z  2 and z  0 In the local volume at z  0 is the accretion 
more  anisotropic  with  an  excess  along  the  plane  of  the  galaxy  disk  There  is  an 
observational evidence of cold gas accretion on galaxies as shown by van der Hulst 
and  Sancisi  2004  The  nearby  case  of  gas  accretion  to  the  Milky  Way  the 
Magellanic Stream was observed in HI by Brns et al 2005 It will be discussed in 
more details later 
The hierarchical theory of galaxy formation assumes that small irregular galaxies 
form first later they merge forming larger galaxies Bournaud et al 2005 concluded 
that  the  mass  ratio  of  the  collision  partners  is  the  most  important  parameter 
determining the global properties of the remnant The major mergers with the mass 
ratio in the range 11  41 produce remnants with the density profile and kinematics 
similar to elliptical galaxies the intermediate mergers in the range 41  101 form 
remnants that could be progenitors of S0 galaxies and minor mergers with mass ratio 
more than 101 result in disturbed spiral galaxies with the thick disk components  
The bars and spiral arms in disk galaxies result from their secular evolution 
Debattista et al 2006 show that the disk-like properties of the galaxy bulges and the 
links between bulge and disk properties indicate that the bulges are formed through the 
evolution of the disk Bulges that often have box- or peanut-shapes are associated to 
the evolution driven by a central bar The secular evolution changes the disk profile 
that  does  not  resemble  its  original  shape  It  is  an  open  task  to  disentangle  what 
properties  of  the  disk  result  from  its  internal  evolution  and  what  result  from 
hierarchical or gas accretion assembly 
The early numerical N-body experiments with rotating disks by Ostriker and 
  of  the  total  kinetic  energy  in 
Peebles  1974  did  show  that  when  the  ratio 
organized rotational motion 
 to the total gravitational energy 
the bar forms in the central part of the disk It is supported by important families of 
stellar orbits making it rather stable configuration 
In the outer parts of the disk the evolution depends on the fraction of the energy 
in random motions relative to gravitational forces In a flat disk this ratio is given with 
a parameter Q derived by Toomre 1964 1977 
 is the radial component of the velocity dispersion in the disk  is the 
 is the disk surface density and G is the constant of gravity 
epicyclic frequency 
 is small enough the disk is cold and consequently Q is small In this case 
it is unstable to perturbations and it forms spiral arms The gravitational field of spiral 
Jan PALOU 
arms perturbs the stellar orbits and increase  R  increasing Q which stabilizes the 
The spiral galaxy disks include besides stars also the ISM This is a dissipative 
component able to decrease its random motions due to inelastic collisions between the 
ISM clouds or in supersonic turbulent motions It agitates spiral arm formation in the 
ISM where the spirals are more pronounced compared to stars  
The gas flow lines are systematically shifted with respect to the stellar orbits 
forming a gravity torque This gravity torque in combination with a viscosity torque 
which is connected to the inelastic collisions between the ISM clouds are the reasons 
for the gradual mass concentration to the galaxy central part forming CMC Stellar 
orbits scatter on the CMC which weakens the central bar Bournaud et al 2005 
analyzed the lifetime of galactic bars they weaken due to growing CMC and due to 
the gravity torque and angular momentum transfer from the infalling gas to the stellar 
bar Their lifetime is finite according to estimates of Bournaud et al 2005 the bar 
exists 12 Gyr 
The above model of the secular evolution of galaxies is summarized by Combes 
2007 the bar forms in a disk when it accumulates sufficient cold gas from accretion 
or minor mergers The bar and spiral arms create a gravity torque which causes the 
inflow of the gas towards the center The inflowing mass builds the CMC Scattering 
of star on the CMC and the gravity torque between the gas flow lines and stellar orbits 
restrict the lifetime of the bar to 12 Gyr A dissolved bar turns to the central galactic 
bulge The reformation of bars needs new accretion of cold gas from outside the 
galaxy 
4  LMC  SMC  AND  THE  MILKY  WAY  SYSTEM 
A nearby example of the gas accretion is the interacting system Milky Way 
Large and Small Magellanic Clouds MWLMCSMC The HI observations by 
Brns et al 2005 showed large scale features such as Magellanic Stream Magellanic 
Bridge Interface Region and the Leading Arm These features are the result of the 
gravitational interaction between the three galaxies maybe in a combination with the 
gas stripping due to diluted hot gas in the galactic halo The  role of stripping is still 
not clear since the plausible model of the interaction explaining the formation of the 
observed features is not accepted However in this case the cold gas is accreted to the 
MW disk periphery There is no direct influence on the disk inner parts where the 
MW bar resides 
An  investigation  of  test  particle  orbits  in  the  galactic  halo  allows  mapping 
extended  parameter  spaces  with  the  genetic  algorithm  using  a  fitness  function  to 
compare the observed features to simulations Rika et al 2007 This search shows 
that if the DM halo of the MW would be flattened the observed features are slightly 
The Evolution of Galaxies 
better reproduced compared to spherical or prolate halo shapes 
The  output  is  sensitive  the  transversal  velocities  of  the  Clouds  The  new 
estimates based on HST proper motions Kallivayalil et al 2006 discovered that the 
transversal velocities of the Clouds are substantially larger than previously estimated 
from HIPPACOS proper motions Kroupa and Bastian 1997 If correct and with the 
same total mass of the Milky Way it may suggest that the Magellanic Clouds are on 
their  first  passage  around  the  Milky  Way  Besla  et  al  2007  However  the  first 
passage model has to reproduce all the morphological features and it is not clear if 
there are some orbits tuning the tidal forces in such a way that the observation is fitted 
There  may  also  be  other  constraints  such  as  total  mass  of  the  MWLMCSMC 
system or initial gas distributions in the galaxy disks necessary to reproduce the 
large-scale shapes of the cold gas features 
5  GAS   STRIPPING   IN   GALAXY  CLUSTERS 
The accretion of cold gas and merger events bring mass to galaxies contributing 
to their growth These processes supply fresh gas used for star formation increasing 
the  star  formation  rates  The  feedback  of  energy  and  mass  from  young stars can 
decrease the mass inflow or even revert it in some places to outflows Star formation 
feedback provides metals to the ISM and it may eject the yields to the ICM which is 
a large depository of metals Renzini 2004 
Butcher  and  Oemler  1978  1984  compared  distant  clusters  of  galaxies  to 
nearby clusters they concluded that there is a higher fraction of blue star forming 
galaxies in distant relative to nearby clusters This substantial evolution in clusters 
may be due to several effects One of them is the gravitational perturbation when a 
galaxy meets along its orbit another one The encounters at velocities of a few 1000 
kms are described as galaxy harassment events by Moore et al 1995 they influence 
the structure of galaxies multiple harassment events can remove galaxy peripheries 
and  change  a  spiral  into  an  S0  type  Other  effects  are  the  tides  from  the  cluster 
potential  itself  or  hydrodynamic  influence  of  the  ICM  called  ram  pressure  gas 
stripping 
The motion of individual galaxies in the ICM of galaxy clusters exerts the ram 
pressure on the ISM Its effect has been predicted by Gunn and Gott 1972 who 
assumed that after the formation of a galaxy cluster the remaining gaseous debris are 
thermalized via shock heating to temperatures above 10 million K This diluted gas of 
low density influences the ISM of spiral galaxies in clusters due to ram pressure The 
ISM is stripped from galaxies which also changes the star formation it is increased at 
the leading edge of the galaxy motion and it is quenched in other places 
The effect of gas stripping is discussed by Jchym et al 2007 in numerical 
simulations with the code GATGET using the SPH with a gravity tree The role of 
Jan PALOU 
galactic orbital history on the stripping amount is stressed Pure stripping may be 
responsible for gas accumulation in tails filaments and ripples in regions with low 
overall ICM occurrence However the total amount of the ICM in clusters cannot be 
produced by pure ISM stripping due to ram pressure it needs to be combined with 
tides and stellar feedback A fraction of the ICM has to have primordial origin
