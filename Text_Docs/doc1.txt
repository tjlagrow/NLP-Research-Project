INTRODUCTION
A long way has been run from the ﬁrst views developped to explain the forma-
tion of galaxies. In 1962, Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandage designed the collapse
scenario, where all galaxies are created with their morphological type, accord-
ing to their angular momentum. Their potentials remained axisymmetric, so
that no angular momentum could be redistributed through gravity torques; the
total mass and gas content was already there at ﬁrst collapse. For elliptical
galaxies, the violent/single collapse picture still remains in some modiﬁed form,
although the most developped and adopted scenario is through agglomeration
of a large number of clumps (e.g. van Albada 1982, Aguilar & Merritt 1990),
that produces de Vaucouleurs proﬁles in r1/4. The merger picture (Toomre
1977, Schweizer 1990), where ellipticals are formed by progressive interaction
and coalescence of many parent galaxies, is favored in hierarchical cosmogonies.
For spiral galaxies, the scenario involves now much more internal dynamical
evolution. Due to gas dissipation and cooling, gravitational instabilities are
continuously maintained in spiral disks, and they drive evolution in much less
than a Hubble time. Spiral galaxies are open systems, that accrete mass reg-
ularly, and their morphological type evolves along the Hubble sequence. Non-
axisymmetric perturbations, such as bars or spirals, produce gravity torques
that drive eﬃcient radial mass ﬂows; vertical resonances thicken disks and form
bulges, and the mass central concentration can destroy bars. Accretion of small
companions can also disperse bars and enlarge the bulge. A major merger can
destroy disks entirely and form an elliptical.
The ﬁrst role of galaxy interactions is to trigger internal evolution, that we
F. Combes
will consider now, in the next section. Speciﬁc aspects of galaxy interactions
and mergers will then be detailed in section 3.
INTERNAL PROCESSES
2.1. Gravitational Viscosity
During their life, galaxies accrete and concentrate mass; this requires that
angular momentum is redistributed, and essentially is tranfered in the outer
parts. For interstellar gas, viscous torques could be thought of to get rid of the
angular momentum. However, normal viscosity is not eﬃcient, due to the very
low density of the gas. Even with macroturbulent viscosity, the time-scales are
longer than the Hubble time at large radii, and could be eﬀective only inside
the central 1kpc (Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974).
The other eﬃcient way to transfer angular momentum is through gravity
torques, due to non-axisymmetric perturbations, or density waves. In the stel-
lar component, trailing spirals transport momentum outwards (Lynden-Bell &
Kalnajs 1972), and if the spiral is open (i.e. the pitch angle large enough), there
exists a phase-shift between the stellar density and the potential of the spiral,
such that a torque is exerted on the particles, and momentum is redistributed
(Zhang 1996). This process is even more important in the gas component, since
it is more responsible to gravitational instabilities, due to eﬃcient cooling. The
coupled star-gas components are more unstable than each separately (e.g. Jog
1992, Romeo 1992). The gravity torques due to instabilities have been called
”gravitational viscosity” (Lin & Pringle 1987a).
Gravitational instabilities are suppressed at small scales through the local
velocity dispersion c, and at large scale by rotation. The corresponding limiting
scales are the Jeans scale for a 2D disk λJ ∼ c2/(Gµ), and λc ∼ Gµ/κ2, where µ
is the disk surface density, and κ the epicyclic frequency. Scales between λJ and
λc are unstable, unless c is larger than πGµ/κ, or the Toomre Q = cκ
πGµ is larger
than 1. If the disk is cold at the beginning (general case for the gas), instabilities
set in, which heat the disk until Q ∼ 1, and those instabilities provide the
necessary angular momentum tranfer (or viscosity) to concentrate the mass.
Since the size of the region over which angular momentum is tranferred is
∼ λc, and the time-scale is a rotation period, 2π/Ω, the eﬀective kinematic
viscosity is ν ∼ λ2
cΩ, and the typical viscous time τν ∼ R2Ω3/(G2µ2).
2.2. Exponential Disks
A galactic disk, submitted to gravitational instabilities can then be compared
to an accretion disk. In the theory of viscous accretion disks, the main eﬀect
of viscosity is to move angular-momentum outward and mass inward. In the
particular hypothesis of equal time-scales between viscosity and star formation,
i.e. τν ∼ τ∗, it can be shown that the ﬁnal surface density of the stellar disk is
INTERACTIONS AND MERGERS
exponential (Lin & Pringle 1987b). An exponential distribution of metallicity
can also be derived in these circumstances Tsujimoto et al. (1995).
The viscous and star-formation time-scales are of the same order of magni-
tude, since the two processes depend exactly on the same physical mechanism,
i.e. gravitational instabilities. As shown empirically by Kennicutt (1989), the
Toomre parameter Q appears to control star-formation in spiral disks. There-
fore, if the regulating instabilities have time to develop, one can expect that
τν ∼ τ∗, as required for exponential light and metallicity distribution.
2.3. Bars and Nuclear Bars
A bar is the most eﬃcient non-axisymmetric perturbation able to drive radial
gas ﬂows. But a single dynamical structure can act only over a limited range
of radii, between the two most characteristic Lindblad resonances; to have a
continuous action over a large radial range, and drive the gas to the nucleus,
multiple-scale perturbations are required, such as bars within bars (e.g. Shlos-
man et al 1989). Bars are frequently triggered by galaxy interactions, and once
the matter has been driven towards the center, the inner disk becomes in turn
unstable to bar formation. Nested bars are often observed in spiral disks (e.g.
Jarvis et al 1988, Wozniak et al 1995), and even more easily in the near-IR
band (Shaw et al 1993, Friedli et al 1996, Jungwiert et al 1997). One of their
main characteristics is that the nuclear bars are inscribed inside the nuclear
ring of the primary bar (corresponding to its inner Lindblad resonance), and
that they can have any orientation with respect to the primary bar.
Numerical simulations have described the numerical processus leading to
their formation (Friedli & Martinet 1993, Combes 1994). In concentrating the
mass towards the center, the ﬁrst bar modiﬁes the inner rotation curve, and the
precessing rate (Ω − κ/2) of the m = 2 elliptical orbits in the center is elevated
to large values. This strong diﬀerential precessing rate prevents the self-gravity
from matching all precessing rates in the center, and decoupling occurs: two
bars rotating at two diﬀerent pattern speeds grow. In the simulations, the two
bars have a resonance in common, most often the inner Lindblad resonance of
the primary bar is the corotation of the secondary one. It is probable that the
two bars exchange energy at this common resonance, and that is the reason of
their growth (Tagger et al 1987).
3. GALAXY INTERACTIONS
Tidal interactions are the main external trigger of dynamical processes that
induce galaxy evolution. They produce non-axisymmetrical perturbations, that
concentrate mass and trigger star-formation. Starbursts are observed when a
huge gas mass is concentrated in the center of the interacting/merging system.
CO emission suggest that the molecular gas represents a signiﬁcant part of the
dynamical mass there (Scoville et al 1991). Non nuclear starbursts are very
F. Combes
rare (cf Stanford et al 1990, Yun et al 1994). To trigger such starbursts, gas
must be brought towards the center in a time-scale short enough with respect
to the feedback time-scale of star-formation (a few 107 yr), that will blow the
gas back outwards (e.g. Larson 1987).
It is through numerical simulations
that insight has been gained in those systems, although many uncertainties
remain about the physics of gas and star formation (see the review by Barnes
& Hernquist 1992).
3.1. Numerical Codes and Star Formation
It is necessary to take into account all components self-consistently, stars, gas
and dark matter. The latter participates actively in dynamical friction and
receives the extra angular momentum, allowing the visible galaxies to merge.
Gas dissipation is a key factor in the formation of density waves and non-
axisymmetric structures, although viscous torques are negligible versus the
gravity torques (Combes et al. 1990). We dont know precisely the actual
viscosity of the ISM, but given its very complex multi-phase and small-scale
structure, it is not relevant to model it in any accurate manner. Any large-
scale hydrodynamical simulation can reproduce the main characteristics of gas
ﬂow in galaxies, provided that viscous torques are negligible. Two families of
gas modelisations are currently used, one based on a continuous diﬀuse ﬂuid,
essentially governed by pressure forces. Such modelisations include artiﬁcial
viscosity to spread shock waves over a few resolution cells. The physics of the
gas is assumed to be isothermal at 104K (case of SPH or ﬁnite diﬀerence codes).
The other modelisation used in galaxy hydrodynamics is the sticky particles
approach, where an ensemble of gas clouds move in ballistic orbits and collide,
without extra pressure and viscosity terms. This modelisation represents more
closely the fragmented structure of the molecular component.
As for star-formation, the numerical codes are very schematical, since the
detailed processes (SFR, IMF) are still unknown. Since stars are observed
to be formed inside giant molecular clouds in our Galaxy, the latter being
the result of agglomerations of smaller entities, one process could be to relate
star formation to cloud-cloud collisions, in the sticky particles modelisation
(Noguchi & Ishibashi 1986). Another more widely used is to adopt a Schmidt
law for the SFR, i.e. the rate is proportional to a power n of the gas volumic
density, n being between 1 and 2 (Mihos et al 1992). In both cases, it was
shown that interacting galaxies were the site of strong starbursts, that could
be explained both by the orbit crowding in density waves triggered by the tidal
interactions, and by the gas inﬂow and central concentrations, accumulating
the gas in small and very dense regions. This depends of course on the non-
linearity of the Schmidt law, and SF-eﬃciency strongly depends on the power
n (see e.g. Mihos et al 1992). Mihos & Hernquist (1994) use a hybrid-particles
techniques, within SPH, to describe the eﬀects of gas depletion and formation
of a young star population. The SPH/young star particles are converted from
gaseous to collisionless form, as soon as their gas mass fraction drops below
INTERACTIONS AND MERGERS
5%. Although this method has many computational advantages (number of
particles ﬁxed), it does not decouple the behaviour of young stars and gas,
especially in the shocks. This also inhibits contagious star formation, or any
feedback mechanisms (Struck-Marcell & Scalo 1987, Parravano 1996).
3.2. Major and Minor Mergers
During the interaction of galaxies of comparable mass, strong non-axisymmetric
forces are exerted on the interstellar gas. But contrary to what could be ex-
pected, the main torques responsible for the gas inﬂow are not directly due
to the companion, but to internal processes triggered by it. The tidal per-
turbations destabilise the primary disk, and the non-axisymmetric structures
generated in the primary disk (bars, spirals) are responsible for the torques.
The self-gravity of the primary disk, and its consequent gravitational instabil-
ities, play the fundamental role. The gas fuel is provided by the primary disk
itself, and not by the companion. This is why the ﬁrst parameter determining
the characteristics of the merger event is the initial mass distribution in the
two interacting galaxies (Mihos & Hernquist 1996). The mass ratio between
the bulge and the disk is a more fundamental parameter than the geometry of
the encounter.
The central bulge stabilises the disk with respect to external perturbations. If
the bulge is suﬃciently massive, the apparition of a strong bar is delayed until
the ﬁnal merging stages, and so is the gas inﬂow, and the consequent star-
formation activity. But the starburst can then be stronger. When the primary
disk is of very late type, without any bulge, the gravitational instability settles
in as soon as the beginning of the interaction, there is then a continuous activity
during the interaction, but at the end the starburst is then less violent, since
most of the gas has been progressively consumed before.
In the simulations, about 75% of the gas is consumed during the merger,
whatever the internal structure of galaxies, or the geometry of the encounter
(Mihos & Hernquist 1996). This is the most uncertain parameter, however,
since the physics of the gas is only schematically reproduced, with too much
viscosity. What is the fate of the rest of the gas? In general long tidal tails are
entrained in the outer parts, especially in neutral hydrogen, since this is the
most abundant component in external parts of galaxies. But most of the ma-
terial of the tails is still bound to the system, and will rain down progressively
onto the merger remnant (Hibbard 1995).
During less equal galaxy interactions, where the mass ratio between the
two colliding galaxies is at least 3, the same features can be noticed:
ﬁrst relevant parameter is the mass concentration in the galaxies before the
interaction (Hernquist & Mihos 1995). The torques responsible for the gas
mass inﬂow are exerted by the non-axisymmetric (essentially m = 2) potential
developped in the disk.

3.3. Tidal Tails and Dark Matter
The extent of tidal tails can help to constrain the amount of dark matter around
galaxies. Simulations have shown that, as the dark-to-luminous mass ratio
increases, the length of the tails and the mass involved in them is considerably
reduced (Dubinski et al 1996). Larger masses imply higher speed encounters,
that will detune resonances between the angular frequency of the orbital and
internal motions, required to form tails. The deeper potential wells to climb
induce shorter tails. Simulations are compatible with observations for dark-to-
luminous mass ratios between 0 and 8, but not higher. This corresponds to
the dark matter detected from HI rotation curves, but rules out more massive
determinations, such as from timing argument for the Milky Way (1012 M⊙
from the orbit of our companion M31).
Interactions and Disks
Galaxy interactions can easily thicken or even destroy a stellar disk (e.g. Gunn
1987). The fragility of stellar disks with respect to thickening has been used
by Toth & Ostriker (1992) to constrain the frequency of merging and the value
of the cosmological parameter Ω. They claim for instance that the Milky Way
disk have accreted less than 4% of its mass within the last 5 109 yrs. Numeri-
cal simulations have tried to quantify the thickening eﬀect (Quinn et al 1993,
Walker et al 1996). They show that the stellar disk thickening can be large and
sudden, but it is strongly moderated by gas hydrodynamics and star-formation
processes, since the thin disk can be reformed continuously through gas infall.
Galaxies presently interacting have their ratio h/z0 of the radial disk scale-
length h to the scaleheight z0 1.5 to 2 times lower than normal (Bottema 1993;
Reshetnikov & Combes 1997). However, since galaxies have experienced many
interactions in the past, including the presently isolated galaxies, all these per-
turbations, thickening of the planes and radial stripping, must be transient,
and disappear after an interaction time-scale, i.e. one Gyr. Present galaxies
are thought to be the result of merging of smaller units, according to theories
of bottom-up galaxy formation; a typical galaxy has accreted most of its mass,
and the existence of shells and ripples attests of the frequency of interactions
(Schweizer & Seitzer 1992). This implies that the global thickness of galaxy
planes can recover their small values after galaxy interactions. Or in other
words, the disk of present day spirals has been essentially assembled at low
redshift (Mo et al 1998).
3.5. Ring Galaxies
Ring galaxies, like the Cartwheel, are believed to be formed during a head-on
encounter between a disk galaxy and a companion crossing its plane (e.g. Lynds
& Toomre 1976, Theys & Spiegel 1976). They constitute an ideal laboratory
to understand the dynamics and physics of the gas in galaxy collisions, since a
INTERACTIONS AND MERGERS
single impulse is given by the companion, and the geometry of the phenomenon
is very simple, (see e.g. Appleton & Struck-Marcell 1996).
Ring galaxies are not among the most violent starburst (> 100 M⊙/yr),
but they reveal about 10 times the star formation activity of normal galaxies.
They are among the rare objects where the starburst is non-nuclear. In the
Cartwheel, the Hα comes exclusively from the outer ring (Higdon 1995), and
80% of it comes from just one quadrant, quite asymmetrically. The recent star
formation rate (Hα) is about 10 times that over the last 15 Gyrs (B-band), and
the consumption time-scale of the HI gas (although abundant 1.3 1010 M⊙) is
only 430 Myrs, of the same order of the ring expansion time-scale.
There are many unsolved problems in ring galaxies, and in the Cartwheel in
particular: the region of the maximum HI density in the ring does not coincide
with the region of maximum star formation (Higdon 1996); but of course we
still do not know the H2 distribution (cf Horellou et al 1995). Also, there is no
gas in the spokes, nor in the center (Higdon 1996), while N-body simulations of
the encounter predict there a gas concentration (e.g. Hernquist & Weil 1993).
3.6. Groups and Clusters
Although the galaxy volumic density is larger in clusters, the relative velocity
also, and tidal interactions might be less eﬀective than in the ﬁeld. Distorted
galaxies with asymmetries, tails and plumes are often observed in the stellar
component (which cannot be due to ram-pressure), but starbursts are less
frequent, since they require a large abundance of gas in the outer parts of
galaxies, available for gas inﬂow, and this gas is removed by tidal stripping. It
is heated and forms then the coronal gas observed in X-ray in compact groups
and clusters. In the case of strong gas deﬁciency, the interaction frequency can
even be anti-correlated with star-formation rate.
This is true even in compact groups, where the relative velocity is not too
high. There is some (controversed) evidence of excess far-infrared emission
(Zepf 1993, Sulentic et al 1993) indicating more star-formation than isolated
galaxies (especially the 60/100µ colors). There is also excess radio emission
(Menon 1995) and HI deﬁciency (Williams et al 1991), which conﬁrm their
peculiarity with respect to ﬁeld galaxies. A recent ROSAT survey of 22 HCGs
(Ponman et al 1996) detected the hot coronal gas through X-ray radiation in
75% of them. But there is no evidence of higher molecular gas content in most
HCG galaxies (Boselli et al 1996, Leon et al 1998). Therefore, although there
exist some obvious signs of interaction, galaxy collisions have limited eﬃciency
(there is no merging), and limited star-formation triggering.
The eﬀect of gas stripping is even more important in rich clusters ( e.g.
Cayatte et al 1990). In Virgo, there is evidence that the global star forma-
tion rates have been reduced (Kennicutt 1983). The accumulation of frequent
high-speed close encounters, dubbed ”harassment” by Moore et al (1996), has
peculiar consequences, quite diﬀerent from the normal galaxy-galaxy binary
interactions and merging. Simulations have shown that these close encounters,
F. Combes
although they are not resonant with the internal motions, can produce the
tidal damage observed in most perturbed galaxies in clusters (e.g. Combes et
al 1988). One issue is to distinguish between the inﬂuence of the global tidal
action of the cluster, and the two-body encounters between individual galaxies.
The former global eﬀect is expected to be signiﬁcant only in the central part,
while the best cases of tidal deformations are observed on the periphery.
Harassment is so eﬃcient that it is possible to account for the rapid galaxy
evolution in rich clusters (Moore et al 1996): within 4-5 Gyr, the morphology
of galaxies in clusters can be transformed from late-type spirals to early-type,
lenticulars and ellipticals. Only 4-5 high-speed collisions are necessary for this
evolution.
4. EVOLUTION WITH REDSHIFT
4.1. Observations of High-z Galaxies
The advent of the Hubble Space Telescope has allowed, through high resolution
imaging, to study galaxy morphology at intermediate redshift (0.1 ≤ z ≤ 1.0).
A striking feature is that high-z galaxies are often seen with tidal features,
distorted morphologies indicative of interactions and mergers. This might be
surprising since tidal arms and distortions are generally weak features, of rela-
tively short life-time, and their detectability is reduced at high redshift (Mihos
1995). The debris and signatures of mergers become invisible after 1 Gyr for
z = 0.4 and after 0.2 Gyr only at z = 1. The fact that tidal distortions are
so omnipresent in high-z galaxies, in spite of this bias, is a clue to the huge
increase of interactions and mergers with z.
In clusters, the relative importance of ”nature or nurture” in accounting
for the large percentage of elliptical galaxies, is still a debated question: are
elliptical galaxies formed at once from rapid collapse in rich environment that
are to become clusters, or are they the result of late merging of disk galaxies,
when the cluster virializes? High-resolution images of clusters at high z can
bring some light to this problem. Dressler et al (1994) have imaged a cluster
at z = 0.4, and suggest that the excess blue galaxies seen in distant clusters
are predominantly normal late-type spirals, undergoing tidal interactions or
mergers. The Butcher-Oemler eﬀet, associated with enhanced star-forming
activity appears now convincingly to be due to enhanced interactions, arising
from hierarchical merging. Clusters at z = 0.4, i.e. 3-4 Gyr ago, appear to
possess a much larger fraction of disk-dominated galaxies than present day
clusters (Couch et al 1994).
In the frame of hierarchical cosmological scenarios, it is expected that the
number of galaxies in a comoving volume increases with redshift, while their
mass decreases. Some trends in that sense have been revealed by HST at very
high redshift (z ≈ 2-3). A population of faint, small, compact objects has been
identiﬁed to the sub-galactic clumps, or building blocks of present day galaxies
INTERACTIONS AND MERGERS
Fig. 1. — Evolution of the rate of interaction and mergers as a function of redshift,
from various estimations. Solid line: estimation from the present number or merger
remnants in the NGC catalog, and frequency of apparition of binary periods P in
P−5/3 from Toomre (1977, T97); no evolution is postulated here. Dashed line: from
the frequency of collisional ring galaxies in deep HST ﬁelds (Lavery et al 1996, L96)
and various other objects (pairs, Butcher-Oemler eﬀet, IRAS faint sources, QSOs,
Carlberg 1991, C91). Dotted line: from the number of interacting pairs (Carlberg et
al 1994, C94). The observed power laws (for z < 1) have been extrapolated to z = 2.
through multiple merging processes (Pascarelle et al 1996, Steidel et al 1996).
However, caution must be used to interprete high redshift data, since fading of
low surface brightness features (as (1 + z)−4), and k-correction eﬀects trans-
form galaxies in later types and more irregular objects, even without evolution
(Giavalisco et al 1996). For instance, van den Bergh et al (1996) have claimed
that barred and grand design galaxies appear under-represented in distant deep
ﬁeld samples, with respect to early-types galaxies. But this could be only the
bias against detecting disks at high z. At very high redshifts, only the high
surface density objects, such as bulges and ellipticals, can be detected.
Galaxy interactions were undoubtedly more frequent in the past, and many
groups have tried to quantify the eﬀect. Already Toomre in 1977 has estimated
the number of mergers from their observed frequency at z = 0 just taking into
account the probability of excentricities of binary orbits. Statistics of close
galaxy pairs from faint-galaxy redshift surveys have shown that the merging
F. Combes
rate increases as a power law with redshift, as (1 + z)m with m = 4 ± 1.5 (e.g.
Yee & Ellingson 1995). Lavery et al (1996) claim that ring galaxies are also
rapidly evolving, with m = 4 − 5, although statistics are still insuﬃcient. Many
other surveys, including IRAS faint sources, or quasars, have also revealed a
high power-law (see ﬁg 1).
4.2. Diﬀerent Evolution Time-scales
We already see at z = 0 a wide range of galaxy properties, that appear to
correspond to various stages of evolution. The main parameter determining
the Hubble sequence is the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio, which increases from
late to early type spiral galaxies. In other words, the mass concentration, and
therefore the evolution stage, increases from Sc to S0. From recent near-IR
surveys, de Jong (1996) and Courteau et al (1996) claim that the bulge mass is
even a better criterion than the bulge-to-disk ratio to deﬁne the sequence. The
total mass increases from Sc to S0, and might be the essential parameter (e.g.
Gavazzi et al 1996). Late-type galaxies and irregulars possess a much larger gas
fraction than early-types, which is also a clue of their low evolution. Galaxy
evolution is indeed driven both by dynamical processes, that concentrate the
mass (see section 2), and star formation that consumes the available cold gas.
Also in the recent years, we have realized the importance of Low Surface
Brightness galaxies (LSB), which appear unevolved systems, with large gas
fraction, and low mass concentration (Bothun et al 1997). Compared to High
Surface Brightness galaxies (HSB), they are more dominated by dark matter,
even within the optical disks, as are dwarf irregulars (de Blok & McGaugh
1997). The clue to their long evolution time-scales might be their poor envi-
ronment, and low interaction frequency (Bothun et al 1997).
N-body simulations have shown that bars and density waves through their
gravity torques can concentrate galaxy masses on a time-scale much shorter
than the Hubble time. Since most spiral galaxies are observed with these
features, this implies rapid evolution along the Hubble sequence. But along
the sequence, galaxies gain visible mass, and their dark-to-luminous mass ratio
decreases: this suggests that some of their dark matter has been transformed
in visible stars (Pfenniger et al 1994, Pfenniger & Combes 1994).
