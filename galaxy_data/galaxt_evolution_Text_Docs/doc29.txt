ABSTRACT
Interstellar dust plays decisive roles in the conversion of neutral to molecular hy-
drogen H2 the thermodynamical evolution of interstellar medium ISM and the
modication of spectral energy distributions SEDs of galaxies These important roles
of dust have not been self-consistently included in previous numerical simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution We have therefore developed a new model by which
one can investigate whether and how galaxy formation and evolution can be inu-
enced by dust-related physical processes such as photo-electric heating H2 formation
on dust and stellar radiation pressure on dust in detail A novel point of the model is
that dierent dust species in a galaxy are represented by live dust particles ie not
test particles Therefore dust particles in a galaxy not only interact gravitationally
with all four components of the galaxy ie dark matter stars gas and dust but
also are grown and destroyed through physical processes of ISM First we describe a
way to include dust-related physical processes in Nbodyhydrodynamical simulations
of galaxy evolution in detail Then we show some preliminary results of dust-regulated
galaxy evolution The preliminary results suggest that the evolution of dust distribu-
tions driven by radiation pressure of stars is very important for the evolution of star
formation rates chemical abundances H2 fractions and gas distributions in galaxies

INTRODUCTION
Galaxy formation is a complicated combination of many
dierent physical processes such as gravitational collapse

Searle  Zinn 1978 hierarchical merging of dark matter
halos eg White  Rees 1978 star formation and its feed-
back eects eg Larson 1974 Dekel  Silk 1986 growth
of bars and spiral arms eg Sellwood  Carlberg 1984
Athanassoula 2003 clump dynamics eg Noguchi 1999
feedback eects of active galactic nuclei eg Di Matteo et
al 2005 Springel et al 2005 hot and cold mode gaseous
accretion eg Keres et al 2005 Dekel  Birmboim 2006
and environmental inuences of groups and clusters eg
Dressler 1980 Bekki  Couch 2011 It has been a key is-
sue for Galactic and extragalactic astronomy to understand
the relative importance of each of these physical processes in
the formation and evolution of galaxies with dierent masses
and Hubble types residing in dierent environments at a give
cosmic time In order to address this key issue many the-

oretical studies have tried to construct as realistic galaxy
formation models as possible by using sophisticated numer-
ical simulations
One of the missing elements in these previous numerical
studies of galaxy formation and evolution is interstellar dust
The ecient conversion from neutral to molecular hydrogen
H2 is possible on the surface of dust grains eg Gould 
Salpeter 1963 Hollenbach  Salpeter 1971 and thermody-
namical evolution of ISM and interstellar chemistry are also
controlled by dust eg Herbst 2002 Furthermore fragmen-
tation processes of metal-poor gas clouds can be signicantly
inuenced by dust abundances so that dust can be very im-
portant for the formation of low-mass stars in the early uni-
verse eg Larson 2005 Schneider  Omukai 2010 In spite
of these importance of dust dust-related physical processes
have not been self-consistently included in almost all sim-
ulations of galaxy formation and evolution The observed
physical processes of dust properties in galaxies have been
investigated so far by one-zone chemical evolution models
eg Dwek 1998 D98 Lisenfeld  Ferrara 1998 Hirashita
1999 Edmunds 2001 Inoue 2003 Calura et al 2008 Asano
2 K Bekki
et al 2013 Zhukovska  Henning 2013 Rowlands et al
Bekki 2013a 2015 B13a and B15 respectively have
rst performed numerical simulations of galaxy formation
and evolution which include self-consistently both i the
formation growth and destruction processes of dust grains
in asymptotic giant branch AGB stars supernovae SNe
and ISM and ii H2 formation on dust grains Thanks to the
self-consistent modeling of dust physics not only the cosmic
evolution of dust but also the physical properties of galaxies
eg gas contents were compared with the latest observa-
tions eg by Herschel in B13a and B15 These simulations
are dierent from previous ones Ferrara et al 1991 F91
Aguirre et al 2001 in which dust grains are represented by
test particles ie moving in a gravitational potential of
a galaxy without inuencing its host galaxy at all so that
the inuences of dust on galaxy formation and evolution
can not be investigated Although our previous simulations
made it possible for us to predict the cosmic evolution his-
tories of dust abundances and distributions in galaxies they
have some problems in modeling dust
One key problem is that gas and dust are assumed
to move exactly the same way in our previous simulations
B13a B15 the simulated spatial distributions and kine-
matics are the same between gas and dust in galaxies This
could be a good approximation given that the timescale of
gas-dust frictional timescale is an order of  103 yr for a
typical range of ISM properties eg Theis  Orlova 2004
which is much shorter than the dynamical timescales of most
galaxies 107  108 yr However as shown in previous the-
oretical works on dust evolution in galaxies only dust can
be expelled from galactic disks through the eects of radia-
tion pressure of stars on dust eg F91 Also the observed
at distribution of halo dust Menard et al 2010 M10 and
the rather high dust-to-gas-ratio D  005 in M81 group
eg Xilouris et al 2006 strongly suggest that the spatial
distributions of dust can be quite dierent from those of gas
in some galaxy environments
Furthermore chemical evolution of galaxies can be sig-
nicantly inuenced by dust removal from galaxies through
radiation-driven winds Bekki  Tsujimoto 2014 which im-
plies that star formation processes in galaxies can be inu-
enced by dust removal from galaxies owing to the processes
dependent on dust and metal abundances Therefore we
would need to model dust removal processes in galaxies more
self-consistently so that we can discuss the roles of dust in
galaxy formation and evolution and the observed wide vari-
ety of dust properties of galaxies in a more comprehensive
way It would be a reasonable strategy for numerical studies
of galaxy formation to treat gas and dust separately be-
cause gas and dust respond dierently to physical processes
of ISM
The purpose of this paper is to describe a new method
by which dust-related physics can be more self-consistently
included in Nbodyhydrodynamical simulations of galaxy
formation and evolution Dust and gas are represented
by separate live particles in the present new simulation
code so that dust-related physical processes such as ra-
diation pressure on dust and dust-gas interaction can be
better investigated Since this is the very rst paper dis-
cussing the possible roles of dust in galaxy formation based
on a new type of galaxy evolution simulations we fo-
cus mainly on the methods to include dust-related physics
in Nbodyhydrodynamical simulations We briey describe
some key results of the new simulations and we discuss ex-
tensively the possible roles of dust in galaxy formation and
evolution in forthcoming papers
The present model is not only a more sophisticated ver-
sion of previous models on the formation of dust wind eg
Chiao  Wickamasinghe 1972 F91 but also an improved
version of previous galaxy evolution models for dusty galax-
ies The important inuences of radiation-driven dust wind
on star-forming regions in galaxies have been recently dis-
cussed by a number of authors eg Thompson et al 2005
Hopkins et al 2012 These works however did not investi-
gate the evolution of dust contents and the possibly separate
distributions of gas and stars in a self-consistent manner
Furthermore previous models for spectral energy distribu-
tions SED of galaxies eg Bekki  Shioya 2000 Jonsson
2006 and for H2 contents of galaxies eg Pelupessy et al
2006 Krumholz et al 2009 assumed a xed dust-to-metal
Dz ratio across the entire region of a simulated galaxy
Such a xed Dz is neither observed eg Galametz et al
2011 nor realistic in theoretical modeling of dust evolution
eg Inoue 2003 Therefore the present model with vari-
able Dz in dierent local regions of a simulated galaxy can
provide more detailed and accurate predictions on H2 con-
tents and SEDs of galaxies
The plan of the paper is as follows First we describe
the details of the adopted new methods to implement dust-
related physical processes in galaxy-scale chemodynamical
simulations Then we present some key results of the new
simulations on the roles of dust in the evolution of star for-
mation rates dust distributions and gas dynamics within
galaxies in 3 In this section we also discuss how the
present results depend on the physical parameters of the
adopted new method for dust-related physics In 4 we dis-
cuss i the advantages and disadvantages of the present new
method over previous ones and ii further improvement of
the method in our future works We summarize our conclu-
sions in 5
Although including dust-related physics in galaxy-scale
Nbodyhydrodynamical simulations is rather new in nu-
merical studies of galaxy formation and evolution there are
already a number of more sophisticated simulations on the
joint evolution of dust and gas in other areas of astronomy
For example Laibe  Price 2014 have already included the
gas-dust interaction for multiple dust components in their
SPH simulations that can be used for the investigation of
planet formation and evolution The methods and numer-
ical techniques used in these simulations in other areas of
astronomy would be useful in the present study However
we do not discuss these because this is beyond the scope of
this paper We accordingly focus on the modeling issues of
galaxy-scale chemodynamical simulations with dust physics
2 THE MODEL
21 A new four-component galaxy model
The most remarkable dierence in dust modeling between
B13a and the present study is that gas and dust in ISM
of galaxies are represented by separate live particles Ac-
cordingly a galaxy consists of dark matter stars gas and

dust four-component model in the present study which is
dierent from almost all previous simulations of galaxy for-
mation and evolution in which a galaxy consists of dark mat-
ter gas and stars three-component Dust particles grav-
itationally interact both with other components of galaxies
eg dark matter and stars and with other dust particles
in the new four-component model Furthermore gas-dust
interaction and response of dust to radiation elds of stars
can be more self-consistently included in the four-component
model As in B13a H2 formation on dust grains and the
formation growth and destruction processes of dust due
to star formation and SN feedback eects are included in
the present model By using an isolated disk galaxy model
described in this section we mainly discuss how radiation
pressure of stars on dust grains can inuence H2 formation
processes and star formation histories of galaxies
The isolated disk model adopted in this study is the
same as those in Bekki 2014b and therefore we briey de-
scribe it here The models for H2 formation on dust grains
and the formation growth and destruction processes of dust
in ISM of galaxies are essentially the same as those adopted
in B13a We thus describe the details of the models only
when they are dierently implemented in the present new
simulations with live dust particles Some new ingredients
that were not included in B13a are described and discussed
in detail in this section Dust-related physical processes that
are missing in the present model yet could be important in
ISM evolution are discussed later in 4
that can be run on clusters of GPU Graphics Processing
Unit machines In the new code gravitational calculations
of many particles can be done on GPUs whereas other cal-
culations eg star formation and hydrodynamics can be
done on CPUs The GPUs are used also in calculating the
radiative force due to radiation pressure of a star particle
on a dust particle which is proportional to Lstarr2 where
Lstar is the total stellar luminosity and r is the distance
between the dust and star particles The code adopts the
smoothed-particle hydrodynamics SPH method for follow-
ing the time evolution of gas dynamics in galaxies The key
dierences in the adopted models between B13a and this
work are summarized in Table 1 and the physical meanings
for symbols used in this work are given in Table 2
22 Disk galaxy model
In the present disk model a galaxy consists of dark matter
stars gas and dust this is the four-component disk model
as opposed to the three-component ie dark matter 
stars  gas one adopted in almost all previous simulations
of galaxy evolution The total masses of dark matter halo
stellar disk gas disk bulge and dust of a disk galaxy are
denoted as Mh Ms Mg Mb and Mdust respectively In
order to describe the initial density prole of dark matter
halo in a disk galaxy we adopt the density distribution of
the NFW halo Navarro Frenk  White 1996 suggested
from CDM simulations
The new simulation code used in this work is based
on the one developed in our previous works B13a B15
r 
rrs1  rrs2 
4 K Bekki
where r 0 and rs are the spherical radius the characteris-
tic density of a dark halo and the scale length of the halo
respectively The c-parameter c  rvirrs where rvir is the
virial radius of a dark matter halo and rvir are chosen ap-
propriately for a given dark halo mass Mdm by using the
cMh relation predicted by recent cosmological simulations
eg Neto et al 2007
The bulge of a disk galaxy has a size of Rb and a scale-
length of R0b and is represented by the Hernquist density
prole The bulge is assumed to have isotropic velocity dis-
persion and the radial velocity dispersion is given accord-
ing to the Jeans equation for a spherical system The ra-
dial R and vertical Z density proles of the stellar disk
are assumed to be proportional to expRR0 with scale
length R0  02Rs and to sech2ZZ0 with scale length
Z0  004Rs respectively The gas disk with a size Rg  2Rs
has the radial and vertical scale lengths of 02Rg and 002Rg
respectively In addition to the rotational velocity caused by
the gravitational eld of disk bulge and dark halo compo-
nents the initial radial and azimuthal velocity dispersions
are assigned to the disc component according to the epicyclic
theory with Toomres parameter Q  15 The vertical ve-
locity dispersion at a given radius is set to be 05 times as
large as the radial velocity dispersion at that point
23 Live dust particle
The initial distribution of dust and kinematics in a disk
galaxy are assumed to be the same as those of the gas The
dust disk of a galaxy is represented by live dust particles
with the total particle number of Ndust this Ndust can in-
crease according to the star formation history of the galaxy
The evolution of each dust particle can be inuenced by
i gravitational force from other components eg stars
and other dust particles Fgrav ii radiation pressure of
stars Frad and iii drag eects of surrounding gas parti-
cles Fdrag Thus the total force exerting on the i-th dust
particle is as follows
Fi  Fgravi  Fradi  Fdragi 
The dust particles can be destroyed by SNe so that their
masses md can be drastically reduced when star formation
occurs around the particles It should be noted here that
this dust particle mass md is dierent from dust grain
mass mdust for each dust component silicate or graphite
which is later used The dust particle is assumed to consist
of numerous dust grains eg silicate and graphite and
accordingly md  dustmdust where dust corresponds to
the number of dust grains in a dust particle
Since gas and dust move independently from each other
in the present simulations the spatial distributions of gas
and dust in a galaxy can be dierent Therefore we esti-
mate the H2 formation on dust grains at each dust parti-
cles position at each time step This is quite dierent from
B13a in which H2 formation is estimated at each gas parti-
cles position owing to the adopted assumption that gas and
dust always have the same spatial distribution The growth
and destruction processes of dust are also estimated at each
dust particles position accordingly to the physical proper-
ties of gas around the dust particle The detailed methods to
implement these are described later in this section The de-

24 Gravitational dynamics and hydrodynamics
Since the total number of particles N  used in this study
is an order of 106 we adopt a direct-summation N-body
algorithm for gravitational interaction between dark mat-
ter stars gas and dust The calculation speed of the direct
summation method can be signicantly increased by using
GPUs or GRAPE-DR which is the latest version of the
special-purpose computer for gravitational dynamics In the
present code the gravitational softening length  is chosen
for each component in a galaxy ie multiple gravitational
softening lengths Thus the gravitational softening length
 can be dierent between dark matter dm stars s
gas g and dust d and  is determined by the initial
mean separation of each component
The gravitational softening lengths for stars gas new
stars and dust are set to be the same with one another
Initial g is set to be signicantly smaller than dm owing to
rather high number-density of gas particles Furthermore
when two dierent components interact gravitationally the
mean softening length for the two components is applied for
the gravitational calculation For example   dm  g2
is used for gravitational interaction between gas and dark
matter The values of dm and g  s are 21 kpc and
02 kpc respectively for the ducial MW-type disk model
later described Thus the gravitational softening length for
interaction between ith and jth particles is as follows
ij 
i  j
where i and j take either of the above ve virtually two
values for the ve components
We consider that galactic ISM composed of gas and dust
can be modeled as an ideal gas with the ratio of specic
heats  being 53 The gaseous temperature Tg is set to
be 104 K initially in all models The basic methods to imple-
ment SPH in the present study are essentially the same as
those proposed by Hernquist  Katz 1989 We adopt the
predictor-corrector algorithm that is accurate to second or-
der in time and space in order to integrate the equations de-
scribing the time evolution of a system Each particle is allo-
cated an individual time step width t that is determined
by physical properties of the particle The maximum time
step width tmax is 001 in simulation units which means
that tmax  141  106 yr in the present study Star for-
mation rates chemical abundances H2 fractions and dust
properties are all updated once for every tmax
The radiative cooling processes for Tg  104K are prop-
erly included by using the cooling curve by the MAPPINGS
III code Sutherland  Dopita 1993 It should be stressed
here that in estimating the cooling rate depending on gas-
phase metallicity and temperature we use the correct gas-
phase metallicity for each gas gas particle Here correct
means that dust-phase metals ie those locked up into
dust grains thus can not participate radiative cooling are
excluded from the estimation of gas-phase metallicities In
estimating gas-phase FeH in B13a and B15 we calculate
the gas-phase Fe mass mFeg for each particle at each time
step as follows
mFeg  mFet  mFed
where mFet and mFed are the total Fe mass and Fe mass
locked up in dust for the particle In the present model we
can simply use the total Fe mass of a gas particle as mFeg
because the evolution of gas and that of dust are separately
examined at each time step ie mFed is always 0 for gas
Thus the present simulation can better estimate the cooling
rates for gas particles than previous simulations that do not
include dust
For 10 6 Tg 6 104K we adopt two analytic formulae
proposed by Wolre et al 2003 for gas cooling in neutral
atomic regions eg by CII 158m cooling and by Galli
 Palla 1998 for H2 cooling The cooling rate coecient
by Wolre et al 2003 is as follows
CIIOI  54  1027T 02
2 e15T2 Z
g ergs cm3 s1
where T2  Tg100 Tg is the gas temperature in units of K
g is the gas-phase metallicity normalized by the solar
value 002 Since this cooling rate is per n2
H where nH is
the hydrogen number density nH needs to be calculated
for each SPH particle at each time step for estimating the
cooling rate The above adopted formula is an approxima-
tion that Wolre et al 2003 derived from full numerical
calculations of ISM by assuming that H atoms are respon-
sible for the excitation of CII and OI for the gas density
less than 3000 cm3 and the gas temperature ranging from
100 K to 1000 K
We adopt the equation A7 described in Galli  Palla
1998 for H2 cooling and the formula is as follows
log H2  1030  9759 log Tg  4805log Tg2
1080log Tg3  09032log Tg4
Since this cooling rate is per nHnH2  we need to calculate the
hydrogen number density nH and H2 number density nH2 
of a SPH gas particle in order to estimate the H2 cooling rate
for the particle In the above H2 cooling formula galaxies
with higher dust abundances are likely to show more ecient
H2 cooling because H2 formation rates are higher in such
galaxies Therefore thermal evolution of ISM and thus gas
dynamics of galaxies can be signicantly inuenced by dust
evolution in the present study
As shown in Galli  Palla 1998 and Hollenbach 
McKee 1989 this H2 cooling rate depends on gas density
too Therefore the adopted formula with a temperature-
dependence only could be less realistic for describing real
Galaxy evolution regulated by dust
ISM evolution inuenced by H2-related physical processes
For example H2 cooling is much less ecient in high-density
ISM with nH  106 cm3 as demonstrated in Figure A1 of
Galli  Palla 1998 Although such high-density gaseous
regions can be rarely formed owing to the adopted resolu-
tion in the present simulations the model without density-
dependent H2 cooling would mean that i the present sim-
ulations overestimate the net cooling of gas in disk galaxies
and ii gas clumps can be more eciently formed and thus
star formation can be more ecient
The inuences of the UV background radiation is not
taken into account in the present models either which means
that heating of ISM by the UV background radiation and
internal UV radiation from young massive stars and active
galactic nuclei AGN in a simulated galaxy is not properly
modeled This heating of ISM could be more important for
the gas dynamical evolution of low-mass disk galaxies where
radiative cooling is less ecient owing to lower metallici-
ties This possible important eect will need to be properly
included in our future galaxy-scale simulations with dust-
related physical processes
25 Star formation
A gas particle is converted into a new star collisionless
particle if the following three SF conditions i-iii are sat-
ised i the local dynamical time scale is shorter than the
sound crossing time scale mimicking the Jeans instability
 ii the local velocity eld is identied as being consistent
with gravitationally collapsing ie div v 0 and iii the
local density exceeds a threshold density for star formation
th This check of gas-to-star-conversion is done at every
001tunit corresponding to the maximum time step width
tmax where tunit is the time units 141  108 yr adopted
in the present simulations In our previous simulations gas-
to-star-conversion is done whenever the above three condi-
tions are satised Therefore the present way to model star
formation is a bit dierent from those in our previous ones
Star formation can increase dramatically the total num-
ber of new stars and dust if only some fractions of gas par-
ticles continue to be converted into new stars at each time
step until the mass of the gas particle becomes very small
Since this method is numerically very costly and practically
infeasible we adopt the following SF conversion method A
gas for which the above three SF conditions are satised
is regarded as having a SF probability Psf 
Psf  1  expCe fH2 tmaxsf 1
where Ce corresponds to a star formation eciency SFE
in molecular cores and is set to be 03 fH2 is the H2 mass
fraction of the gas particle tmax is the maximum time step
width for the particle  is the gas density of the particle
and sf
is the power-law slope of the Kennicutt-Schmidt
law SFR sf
 Kennicutt 1998 A reasonable value of
sf  15 is adopted in the present study This SF probabil-
ity has been already introduced in our early chemodynami-
cal simulations of galaxies eg Bekki  Shioya 1998 By
generating random numbers we implement this SF method
See B13a and B15 for this
Each SN is assumed to eject the feedback energy Esn
of 1051 erg and 90 and 10 of Esn are used for the increase
of thermal energy thermal feedback and random motion
6 K Bekki
kinematic feedback respectively The thermal energy is
used for the adiabatic expansion phase where each SN can
remain adiabatic for a timescale of tadi This adiabatic model
is adopted both for SNIa and SNII Although tadi  105 yr
is reasonable for a single SN explosion we adopt a much
longer tadi of  106 yr This is mainly because multiple SN
explosions can occur for a gas particle with a mass of 105M
in these galaxy-scale simulations and tadi can be dierent
for multiple SN explosions in a small local region owing to
complicated interaction between gaseous ejecta from dier-
ent SNe Such interaction of multiple SN explosions would
make the adiabatic phase signicantly longer in real ISM of
galaxies We adopt a canonical Salpeter stellar initial mass
function IMF with the slope IMF of 235 and the up-
per and lower cuto masses being 01M and 100M re-
spectively for all models in the present study
26 Chemical enrichment
The present model for chemical enrichment processes of
galaxies is essentially similar to those used in B13a and
B15 though the minor details are dierent between these
works Therefore we briey describe only the key elements
of the model here Chemical enrichment through star for-
mation and metal ejection from SNIa II and AGB stars
is self-consistently included in the chemodynamical simula-
tions We investigate the time evolution of the 11 chemical
elements of H He C N O Fe Mg Ca Si S and Ba in order
to predict both chemical abundances and dust properties in
the present study We consider the time delay between the
epoch of star formation and those of supernova explosions
and commencement of AGB phases ie non-instantaneous
recycling of chemical elements
We adopt the prompt SN Ia model in which the delay
time distribution DTD of SNe Ia is consistent with recent
observational results by extensive SN Ia surveys eg Man-
nucci et al 2006 We adopt the nucleosynthesis yields of
SNe II and Ia from Tsujimoto et al 1995 T95 and AGB
stars from van den Hoek  Groenewegen 1997 VG97 in
order to estimate chemical yields in the present study In the
present study ejecta from SNe and AGB stars can become
either dust particles or gas-phase metals in gas particles
Therefore the implementation of chemical enrichment pro-
cess in the present study with live dust particles is dierent
from those adopted in B13a and B15
Metals ejected from a stellar particle SNIa or SNII or
AGB star are assumed to be equally distributed among
neighboring SPH gas particles around the stellar particle
These neighboring particles are selected for each SN or
AGB star if SPH particles satisfy the following condition
R 6 Rmix
where R is the distance between a SPH particle and a SN
or AGB star and Rmix is the mixing radius parameter
The introduced mixing radius Rmix is set to be the same
as the softening length for gas from the stellar particle Al-
though metals can be locally mixed with gas in this model
the mixing process of metals in real ISM might be more com-
plicated than homogeneous mixing described in the present
model The particle-to-particle abundance dierences cor-
responding to abundance dierences in dierent local gas
clouds therefore might not be so realistically modeled in
the present study
A new stellar particle new star which is regarded
as a cluster of numerous stars with a given IMF eject dust
and metals only three times 27  107 yr corresponding to
SNII explosions denoted as tSNII 108 yr prompt SNIa ex-
plosions tSNIa and 23  108 onset of AGB phases tAGB
after the star formation A dust particle with chemical ele-
ments derived from the adopted IMF and dust yield is cre-
ated at each ejection process Therefore the total mass of a
star born at the time t  tform can reduce at each ejection
process tform  t For example the total mass of j-th el-
ement for i-th stellar particle msij  after SNII explosions
is as follows
msij t  tform  tSNII  msij t  tform
mdij  mejij 
where mdij is the total mass of j-th element of a dust parti-
cle produced by i-th stellar particle and mejij is the total
mass of j-th element of the ejected gas from i-th stellar
particle The total mass of j-th element of k-th gas parti-
cle around i-th stellar particle increases as a result of metal
ejection as follows
mgkj t  tform  tSNII  mgkj t  tform
mejij Nneii 
where Nneii is the total number of gas particles around the
stellar particle ie within the SPH-smoothing length hk
for k-th gas particle By replacing tSNII with tSNIa and tAGB
we can estimate the mass evolution of stellar and gaseous
particles due to SNIa explosions and stellar mass loss of
AGB stars
We limit the number of dust and metal ejection to only
three times because we need to avoid an unnecessarily large
number of particles that can virtually make it impossible for
us to simulate galaxy evolution owing to the dust-related
calculations The dust particles initially in thin disks and
those from SNIa SNII and AGB stars are labeled as old
SNIa SNII and AGB dust respectively The maximum
total number of particles of a simulation for which we can n-
ish all calculations of a model within a reasonable timescale
less than a week on a single GPU server Tesla K10 used
in this paper is around 2  106 This means that we need
to have a massively parallel cluster to run N  108  109 for
cosmological hydrodynamical simulations with dust dynam-
ics and recycling We discuss how to implement the present
new code to run on such a large cluster in our forthcoming
papers

dierent in dierent gas particles and given according to the
positions of the particles within its host disk galaxy The

27 Dust growth and destruction
Although the dust model adopted in the present study is
similar to those adopted by B13a and B15 there are some
dierences between these models owing to the newly adopted
live dust particle method We here describe the model with
special emphasis on the model dierences We calculate the
total mass of jth component jC O Mg Si S Ca and
Fe of dust from kth type of stars k  I II and AGB for
SNe Ia SNe II and AGB stars respectively based on the
methods described in B13a that is similar to those adopted
in D98 We consider that the key parameter in dust accretion
is the dust accretion timescale a In the present study
this parameter can vary between dierent gas particles and
is thus represented by al for lth gas particle
The mass of jth component jC O Mg Si S Ca
and Fe of ith dust particle at time t can increase owing to
metal accretion onto the dust from the surrounding gas par-
ticles The mass increase of jth element of ith dust particle
due to the metal-transfer between gas and dust particles is
described as
macc
dij t  timgmeanij tameani 
where ti is the individual time step width for ith dust
particle and mgmeanij
is the mean mass of jth chemical
element for all gas particles around ith dust particle and
ameani
is the mean dust accretion timescale for the gas
particles In order to estimate mgmeanij and ameani  we
choose a gas particle as a surrounding particle around ith
dust particle if it satises the following condition
R 6 Rgrow
where R is the distance between the gas particle and ith
dust particle and Rgrow is a parameter for this neighbor
particle search Since dust particles do not have smoothing
length like SPH particles we have to introduce this parame-
ter Rgrow This Rgrow is set to be 05g where g is the grav-
itational length for gas and the dependence of the present
results on Rgrow is discussed in Appendix B
Therefore mgmeanij and ameani are estimated as fol-
mgmeanij 
mgkj 
ameani 
ak 
where ak is the dust growth timescale for kth gas parti-
cle These ways to estimate dust growth become dierent
from our previous ones the equation 9 in B13a because of
the adopted live dust particle method Owing to this dust
growth the mass of jth chemical component of kth gas par-
ticle is reduce and this reduction is estimated at each time
Dust grains can be destroyed though supernova blast
waves in the ISM of galaxies eg McKee 1989 and the de-
struction process is parameterized by the destruction time
scale d in previous one-zone models eg Lisenfeld  Fer-
rara 1998 Hirashita 1999 Although B13a and B15 adopted
a model similar to these one-zone models the present study
adopts a dierent one The decrease of the mass of jth com-
ponent of ith dust particle at time t due to dust destruction
process is as follows
mdest
dij t  fdesti mdij t
where fdest is the mass fraction of dust destroyed by SNe
and assumed to be a free parameter in the present study
The possibly reasonable range of this parameter will be dis-
8 K Bekki
cussed later in this paper Although fdust can be dierent
depending on the physical conditions of ISM eg Jones
et al 1995 we adopted a simplied assumption of a xed
fdest in this study The dust destroyed by SNe can be re-
turned back to the ISM and therefore fdesti mdij tNneii
is added to each of the neighboring gas particle around the
dust particle This mass increase and decrease is estimated
only when SNII and SNIa explosions occur for each stel-
lar particle This metal-transfer calculation is done for gas
particles if the particles satisfy the following condition
R 6 Rdest
where R is the distance between a SPH particle and a SN
and Rdest is the destruction radius This destruction radius
is set to be the same as the mixing radius Rmix for SNe
Thus the equation for the time evolution of jth compo-
nent of metals for ith dust particle is given as
mdij t  ti  mdij t  macc
dij t  mdest
dij t
When star formation occurs in a molecular cloud dust can
be consumed by star formation and locked up in planets
around stars In the present study we do not consider this
dust consumption by star and planet formation mainly be-
cause we need to introduce another sets of model parame-
ters The total mass of dust locked up in stars and planets
could be signicantly smaller than the total amount of dust
grown from ISM and produced by stars We discuss this
important issue in our forthcoming papers
The dust accretion time scale a is assumed to be
dierent between dierent particles with dierent gaseous
properties and changes with time according to the changes
of gaseous properties in the present study In adopting this
variable dust accretion VDA model we introduce a few
additional parameters in VDA in order to describe the pos-
sible dependences of a of gas particles on the gas densities
temperature and chemical abundances Our previous sim-
ulations with VDA B15 have already demonstrated the
importance of dust accretion and destruction in the evolu-
tion of dust-to-gas-ratios D and H2 mass fractions fH2 
Since the details of the VDA model is given in B15 we
describe only the key ingredients of the VDA model below
We adopt the following dependence of ai on the mass
density and temperature of ith gas particle in the VDA
ai  0
where gi and Tgi are the gas density and temperature of i-
th gas particle respectively a0 typical ISM density at the
solar neighborhood and Tg0 temperature of cold gas are
set to be 1 atom cm3 and 20K respectively and 0 is a ref-
erence dust accretion timescale at g0 and Tg0 As discussed
in B15 galaxy-scale simulations like the present ones can
not resolve the atomic-scale physics of dust growth much
smaller than the possible resolution of the present simula-
tions Therefore the above ai for a gas particle should
be regarded as the dust growth timescale averaged over the
smoothing length of the particle 10  100 pc As shown in
previous one-zone models eg D98 and our previous sim-
ulations B13a the dust accretion time-scale should be an
order of 108 yr so that the observed dust abundances and
fH2 can be reproduced We therefore adopt a0  2  108
yr for all models of the present study

diation pressure Only one every ten particles is plotted to reduce
the le size of this gure yet the detail of the dust distribution
can be clearly seen The time T in the upper left corner of each
panel indicates time that has elapsed since the simulation started
28 H2 formation and dissociation
The H2 formation and dissociation processes can be regu-
lated by dust evolution because the major formation sites of
H2 is on dust grains The model for these processes adopted
in the present study is exactly the same as those used in
B13a H2 formation on dust grains and H2 dissociation by
FUV radiation are both self-consistently included in chemo-
dynamical simulations Recent theoretical studies on H2 for-
mation on dust grains have revealed the important roles of
dust temperature and its random uctuation in H2 forma-
tion on dust grains eg Bron et al 2014 We however do
not include these mainly because dust temperature and its
uctuation for each dust particle can not be reliably derived

describe the methods The SEDs of stellar particles around
each i-th gas particles thus ISRF are rst estimated from
ages and metallicities of the stars by using stellar population
synthesis codes for a given IMF eg Bruzual  Charlot
2003 Then the strength of the FUV-part of the ISRF is
estimated from the SEDs so that i can be derived for the i-
th gas particle Based on i Di and Hi of the gas particle
we can derive fH2i See Fig 1 in B13a Thus each gas
particle has fH2i  metallicity FeH and gas density all of
which are used for estimating the IMF slopes for the particle
when it is converted into a new star The ages of stars t0
are assumed to be free parameters ranging from 01 Gyr and
10 Gyr in the present study
29 Photo-electric heating by dust
Heating of ISM through the photo-electric PEH ejections
of electrons from dust grains interacting with ISRF has been
discussed by many theoretical works eg Watson 1972
Draine 1978 Bakes  Tielens 1994 BT94 These works
clearly demonstrated that the photo-electric heating is im-
portant in the thermal history of ISM and the level of this
importance depends on the detailed physical conditions of
ISM such as the strength of ISRF and dust size distributions
eg BT94 We here include this important photo-electric
heating in our galaxy-scale simulations in such a way that
the net heating rate is estimated for each gas particle accord-
ing to the physical properties of the gas particle and those
of dust particles around the gas particle Since our estima-
tion of the photo-electric heating rate is estimated directly
from gas and dust properties our model is much better than
those adopted in other galaxy-scale simulations with photo-
electric heating eg Tasker 2011 in which the evolution of
ISRF and dust abundances is not considered
Figure 2 The same as Fig 1 but for the distribution of graphite
The more extended distribution of graphite in this gure is due
to the combination of the adopted small dust size and At  0
mag The models with larger At show less extended distributions
of dust
in the present simulation without a realistic model for dust
temperature estimation
The temperature Tg hydrogen density H dust-to-
gas ratio D of a gas particle and the strength of the FUV
radiation eld  around the gas particle are calculated at
each time step so that the fraction of molecular hydrogen
fH2  for the gas particle can be derived based on the H2
formationdestruction equilibrium conditions Thus the H2
fraction for i-th gas particle fH2i  is given as
fH2i  F Tgi  Hi  Di i
where F means a function for fH2i determination The stan-
dard value 3  1017 cm3 s1 for the total volume H2 for-
mation rate is adopted for all models of the present study
Since the detail of the derivation methods of i and
fH2i thus F  are given in B13a and B15 we here briey
10 K Bekki
We adopt the analytic formula for photo-electric heat-
ing rate npe proposed by BT94 as follows
npe  10  1024nG0 ergs cm3 s1
where n is the number density of gas  is the heating e-
ciency and G0 is the intensity of the incident far-UV eld
in units of Habing interstellar radiation eld BT94 showed
that i  depends mainly on G0 Tg and ne where ne is the
electron number density in ISM eg equation 43 in BT94
and ii  ranges from 0001 to 005 within their models Al-
though our simulations can output G0 n and Tg ne is not
the direct output of our simulations We therefore assume
that  is a parameter for a model in the present study We
mainly show the results of the models with   0003 in the
present study and our forthcoming papers will discuss how
 can control thermal evolution of ISM in galaxies
In estimating G0 for each gas particle we need to con-
sider that not all of the FUV ux of a star around the gas
particle can be used for photo-electric heating owing to dust
extinction The ux at a wavelength  for ith star around
jth gas particle in a screen model can be given as follows
fi  f0iej rij hj 
where f0i is the original ux of the star j is the optical
depth ie   0921A rij is the distance of the gas and
the star and hj is the SPH smoothing length of the gas
particle Therefore the G0 factor for photo-electric heating
of jth gas particle from ith stellar particle G0ij  is
G0ij  Fextij g0ij
where g0ij is G0 estimated by assuming no dust extinction
and Fextij
is the fraction of light absorbed by dust and
given as follows
Fextij  Z 1
ej rdr
where j is the FUV optical depth and a xed value is used
Since the adopted SPH kernel is 0 at hj  the above integra-
tion range needs to be from 0 to 1 In deriving j  we rst
estimate the optical dust extinction AVj  based on the gas
column density NHj  and the dust-to-gas-ratio Dj  Then
we estimate AFUVj from AVj by using the Calzetts extinc-
tion law ie the equation 4 in Calzetti et al 2000 In
estimating AVj  we use the following observational results
around the solar neighborhood Predehl  Schmitt 1995
 18  1021 atoms cm2 mag1
Accordingly AVj is linearly proportional to NHj and Dj 
The ratio of AFUV to AV is estimated to be 256 and this
xed value is used for all gas particles to derive AFUV
thus FUV The local column density NHj
is estimated
as jHhj  where jH is the 3D hydrogen density and hj
is the smoothing length for the SPH gas particle Thus G0
can be estimated from physical properties of gas and dust
in a self-consistent manner

cate upper and graphite lower at four selected time steps in

can be important in thermal histories in some galaxy envi-
ronments eg central starburst regions We therefore in-
clude this cosmic-ray heating by using the following analytic
formula described in Tielens 2005
nCR  30  1027n
2  1016  ergs cm3 s1
where CR is total cosmic ionization rate If cosmic ray orig-
inates from SNe then it is reasonable for us to assume that
the total ux of comic ray in a galaxy is proportional to
the SFR of the galaxy We therefore assume that CR is
21016
13M yr1  s1 where the reference SFR of 13M
yr1 corresponds to the present SFR of the Galaxy eg
Draine 2009 We admit that there is a great uncertainty in
the scaling relation between CR and SFRs of galaxies Ac-
cordingly it would be better for the present study to discuss
the roles of dust in the evolution of ISM by not including
cosmic-ray heating
211 Gas-dust heating
210 Cosmic-ray heating
Although gas heading by cosmic-ray CR would not be
so ecient as photo-electric heating in typical ISM of star-
forming galaxies n  1 atom cm3 SFR 1 M yr1 it
In principle we can estimate separately the temperature of
gas Tg and that of dust Td in the present study with
the new live dust particle method If Td is higher than Tg
then ISM can be heated up Given that the observed mean
Td is around 20  30K Dunne et al 2001 and thus not so
dierent this dust-gas heating would be important only for
a small amount of gas in galaxies We adopt the following
formula Tielens 2005 for the estimation of dust-gas cooling
ngd  10  1033nT 05
Td  Tg ergs cm3 s1
In order to derive Td we use the observed scaling relation
between Td and LFIR total FIR luminosity by Amblard et
al 2010 as follows
Td K  205  44 logLFIRL
We estimate LFIR from the observed relation between SFR
and LFIR Kennicutt 1998 as follows
Myr1 
58  109L
In the above estimation of gd the dust temperature of
a galaxy is estimated by using the galactic SFR and Td is
used for all gaseous particles This method is clearly over-
simplied though such a simple model could possibly grasp
some essential ingredients of dust-gas heating in ISM evo-
lution We therefore do not include the adopted dust-gas
heating in most of the present simulations We just briey
discuss how the possible eects of dust-gas heating on ISM
are for a number of models As Bekki  Shioya 2000 has
already shown Td can be estimated for each particle by
using radiation-transfer models for arbitrary geometry of a
galaxy modeled by Nbody  gas dynamical simulations In
our forthcoming papers we need to estimate Td for each
dust particle so that we can discuss the roles of dust-gas
heating in ISM evolution in a more convincing manner
212 Gaseous drag eects on dust
Theis  Orlova 2004 rst investigated the roles of dust in
dynamical evolution of ISM in the central regions of galaxies
and thereby found that the central gas disks can become dy-
namically unstable if the mass fractions of dust in the disks
exceed 2 These results imply that gas-dust coupling by a
drag force in ISM can be an important aspect of ISM evo-
lution in galaxies However the frictional drag timescale
drag which corresponds to the timescale for momentum
transfer between gas and dust through gas-dust collision is
rather short an order of 103  104 yr for ISM with typi-
cal dust sizes and masses The maximum time-step width
tmax  106 yr in the present simulations is signicantly
longer than drag Therefore it would be reasonable for us
to assume that even if gas and dust initially have dier-
ent velocities they come to have identical velocities within
tmax
However drag can be longer than tmax in some local
regions during the evolution of ISM We accordingly inves-
tigate how the gaseous drag can inuence the evolution of
dust in galaxies by adopting the model below The frictional
drag force Fdrag between gas and dust is described as fol-
Fdrag  Cdragdustvd  vg
where vd and vg are the velocity vectors of dust and gas
respectively and dust is mdmdust where md is the dust
particle mass and mdust is the mass of a dust grain this
dust needs to be considered because this Fdrag is for a dust
Galaxy evolution regulated by dust
partilce not for a dust grain The coecient Cdrag corre-
sponding to  1
drag Noh et al 1991 Theis  Orlova 2004 is
given as
Cdrag 
cgvth
where c g vth and mdust are the cross section of a dust
grain c  R2
dust where Rdust is the dust size the mass
density of the gas the thermal velocity of the gas and the
total mass of the grain It should be stressed here that this
mdust is not the mass of a dust particle in a simulation
In implementing the above drag eects for each dust
particle in a simulation we need to consider that Fdrag for
ith dust particle Fdragi  is the force from all gas particles
around the dust particle as follows
Fdragi  fdragij 
where fdragij
is the drag force between ith dust particle
and jth gas particle that is the nearest to the dust particle
This fdragij
is calculated from the velocities of the parti-
cles and Cdrag The back-reaction of the drag force needs
to be considered for jth gas particle because of momentum
conservation as follows
Fdragj  mdifdragij mgj 
These drag terms are added to the equations of motion at
each time step
213 Radiation pressure of stars on dust
Barsella et al 1989 and F91 investigated how radiation
pressure of stars on dust grains can inuence their orbital
evolution around their host galaxy by using some idealized
models in which both the gravitational potential and the
light distribution of the galaxy are xed during dust evolu-
tion Here we improve their model by calculating the light
and mass distributions of a galaxy at every time step so that
we can better estimate the 3D radiation eld of the galaxy
For each ith dust particle Fradi is the sum of the force due
to radiation pressure from all stars as follows eg Barsella
et al 1989
Fradi 
dustR2
dustQ
xi  xj
4xi  xj3 
where Q
pr is the frequency-averaged radiation pressure co-
ecient for a grain c is the speed of light Ns is the total
number of stellar particles Lj is the total luminosity of jth
stellar particle xi is the 3D position vector of ith dust par-
ticle and xj is the 3D position vector of jth stellar particle
Since this is Frad for a dust particle the dust factor needs
to be considered
In order to estimate Lsj for jth stellar particle with a
metallicity and an age we use the stellar population synthe-
sis code by Bruzual  Charlot 2003 for the adopted IMF
By considering dust extinction we can estimate Lsj as fol-
Lsj  msj 1
j e0921Aj 
where j is the mass-to-light-ratio derived from the stellar
population synthesis code for jth stellar particle and Aj is
the dust extinction for the particle If we estimate Aj in

Figure 7 The same as Fig 6 but for the silicate distribution in the MW-type disk with radiation pressure and heavy dust extinction
At  1 mag It should be stressed here that dust can not be so extended in the vertical direction owing to the much weaker stellar
radiation eld in this model
a fully self-consistent manner we need to do so by inves-
tigating the column densities and dust abundances of all
gas particles that the light of jth stellar particle can pass
through while it is traveling to ith dust particle This means
that the required time for the calculation of Frad for just one
dust particle is proportional to NsNg thus the calculations
for all dust particles at each time step is proportional to
NdNsNg virtually  N 3 This calculation is very numeri-
cally costly and thus infeasible unless a fast method for this
calculation is developed We therefore investigate the mod-
els with a xed total dust extinction At in which At is
0 03 1 and 2 mag By comparing the model with dier-
ent At we can better understand how dust extinction can
be important for the evolution of dust being inuenced by
radiation pressure of stars in galaxies
Following F91 we investigate mainly two dust species
interstellar silicate with Rdust  01 m and dust  30 g
cm3 and graphite with Rdust  005 m and dust  23 g
cm3 In order to demonstrate the roles of radiation pres-
sure of stars in the evolution of dust more clearly interstellar
dust is assumed to be either of the above silicate or graphite
in the present simulations Given that interstellar dust con-
sists of dierent grains with dierent compositions and sizes
this is obviously an over-simplication Although we admit
this we think that we need to start this investigation with
a somewhat idealized model in order to grasp some essential
ingredients of stellar radiation pressure on dust dynamics
We therefore try to understand the inuences of stellar ra-
diation pressure on dust evolution by using a simpler model
in the present study and will construct a more realistic and
14 K Bekki
complicated model for the inuences on dust with dierent
masses and sizes in our future papers
As a galaxy evolves Q
pr for a given grain also changes
according to the time evolution of its SED It is therefore
self-consistent and ideal for the present study to estimate
pr at each time step by considering the SED evolution of
a galaxy However this self-consistent estimation of time-
varying Q
pr could make the present simulated code very
complicated because the derivation of the dust-corrected
SED of a simulated galaxy is not a simple task eg Bekki
 Shioya 2000 We therefore adopt an idealized model in
which Q
pr for a dust grain is constant all over the time in
a simulation We mainly investigate the evolution of disk
galaxies with a smaller gas fraction only for  1 Gyr for
most models Therefore this assumption might be justied
because the SED does not change drastically owing to the
lack of major bursts of star formation
Barsella et al 1989 derived Q
pr by assuming a single
black body temperature and listed the values for dierent
temperatures in their Table 1 F91 considered the SEDs of
galaxies with Sb and Sc Hubble types and estimated Q
and showed the dependence of Q
pr on dust grain sizes in
their Fig 1 The estimated Q
pr of silicate with Rdust  01
m is  1 and that of graphite grains with Rdust  005 m
is  1 too for late-type disk galaxies Although we use these
values as a reference we also investigate how the present
results depend on Q
pr by using the models with dierent
214 Dust-related processes not included in this
It is important for the present study to clearly indicate
the dust-related physical processes that are not included in
the new live dust particle model Table 1 briey summa-
rize this The following three important processes are not
modeled in the present study The rst is the size distribu-
tion of dust and its evolution in ISM of galaxies The dust
size distribution which is a key parameter for the SEDs of
galaxies can be signicantly evolved owing to selective de-
struction of smaller dust grains eg Asano et al 2014
The second is the dust evolution due to coagulation and
shattering of dust grains in ISM which is included in recent
one-zone models eg Hirashita 2012 Given that the net
formation eciency of H2 on dust grains in ISM of a galaxy
depends strongly on the dust size distribution not including
these two could underestimate or overestimate H2 contents
of galaxies
Third is the destruction of dust by warmhot gaseous
halos of galaxies the detailed processes of which would de-
pend on the mass-density and temperature of gaseous ha-
los This non-inclusion of dust destruction can result in the
overestimation of the total dust mass in the halo regions of
galaxies The lack of the detailed observational information
on the 3D distributions of gas density and temperature in
the Galactic halo currently prevents us from discussing the
level of this possible overestimation of the dust mass Other
possibly important factors such as magnetic elds and tur-
bulence of ISM are not included either in this work because
they could play a relatively minor role in comparison with
other factors discussed in the present work
The size distributions of dust can be inuenced by dust
formation destruction growth coagulation and shattering
processes and thus SEDs can be inuenced by these pro-
cesses too The radiation pressure of stars on dust grains is
determined by Q
pr and thus by dust-corrected SEDs There-
fore ultimately speaking both i radiative-transfer of stel-
lar light in dusty ISM and ii dust-related physical pro-
cesses need to be self-consistently solved at each time step
in a simulation This means that the present code is not
so fully self-consistent and our future simulation codes will
need to incorporate above two complicated ingredients of
dusty ISM evolution for modeling ISM of galaxies in a much
more self-consistent way
215 Parameter study
2151 Fiducial MW-type disk galaxy model
We mainly investigate the MW-type disk model with Mh 
1012M in which spatial distributions of gas and stars
are consistent with the observed one for the Galaxy The
adopted model parameters such as Ms and Mg are given
in Table 4 Since the main purpose of this paper is not
to describe the dependences of the results on the physi-
cal properties of disks we investigate only three other disks
models These are LMC-type referred to as LMC with
Mh  1011M Dwarf-type DW with Mh  1010M
and Sa-type with Mh  1012M and a big bulge with
Mb  12  1011M ie BT067 corresponding to early-
type spirals These names are used just for distinguishing
three disk galaxies with dierent Mh The model parameters
for these disk models are also given in Table 3
First we show the results of the ducial MW-type disk
model with stellar radiation pressure on dust grains in order
to discuss the basic roles of the radiation pressure on dust
evolution in 31 We do not include dust-related physical
processes other than stellar radiation pressure in the du-
cial model because we need to show the basic roles of dust
as clearly as possible Then we describe how the present re-
sults can depend on other model parameters in 32 The
basic parameters and physical processes included or not
included in the ducial model are given in Table 4 The
initial total numbers of particles used in the ducial MW-
type LMC-type Dwarf-type and Sa-type disk models are
1134000 1100000 1100000 and 1234000 respectively The
total particle numbers can increase as star formation creates
new SNe and AGB stars
2152 Key parameters
The main purpose of this paper is to understand the roles
of radiation-driven dust wind in the evolution of dust star
formation rates SFRs and molecular fractions fH2  and
chemical abundances of galaxies Therefore we rst investi-
gate these roles by using the ducial MW models with and
without radiation pressure of stars on dust In these mod-
els the eects of photo-electric heating dust-gas heating
gaseous drag and cosmic-ray heating are not included so
that we can more clearly understand the roles of radiation-
driven dust wind in galaxy evolution The key parameters
in this rst study is the initial ages of stars in the disks t0
pr dust-types and At total dust extinction Then we
investigate dierent disk models with and without dierent

radiation-driven dust wind in galaxy evolution in these mod-
els can be clearly seen in the models The adopted values of
the four key parameters are shown in Table 5
2153 Photo-electric heating and gas-dust drag
Although we have found important roles of photo-electric
heating of ISM by dust in the star formation histories SFHs
of galaxies we do not discuss these extensively in the present
study and will describe them in detail in our forthcoming
papers This is mainly because we need to discuss this issue
thoroughly by using the results of many models and thus it
is not so appropriate for the present study to include them
in this rst paper We have also found the eects of gas-
dust drag on the evolution of the 3D spatial distributions of
gas and dust in galaxies We however discuss these in our
forthcoming paper for the same reason as above
3 RESULTS
31 MW-type disk
311 Radiation-driven dust evolution
Fig 1 shows how the strong radiation eld of old stars in
the disk can inuence the dynamical evolution of old silicate
in the ducial MW-type disk model Here old dust means
dust particles that are initially in the disk and therefore
the old dust particles do not include dust produced from
SNe and AGB stars after star formation Clearly the inner
dust particles can be pushed out by the galaxy-wide strong
radiation pressure of stars so that a ring-like structure can
be once formed in the disk T  028 and 056 Gyr The
initially thin disk of old dust appears to be thickened owing
to the outward transfer of dust particle by the radiation
pressure The mean z of the dust particles can increase
from 024 kpc at T  0 Gyr to 14 kpc at T  028 Gyr to
19 kpc at T  11 Gyr in this model The nal distribution
of the old dust disk viewed from edge-on is like a disk galaxy
with an inner thick disk T  11 Gyr
Most of the dust particles can not escape from the
galaxy owing to the deep galactic potential of this massive
disk galaxy Mh  1012M Only 04 of the particles can
once locate outside the virial radius rvir  245 kpc and
98 of the particles are nally within Rg  2Rs initial
gas disk size in this model However as shown in Fig 2 for
the time evolution of the spatial distributions of graphite a
large fraction of graphite appears to escape from the inner
halo region of the galaxy About 19 of the particles can
escape from the galaxy ie R  rvir within  1 Gyr and
only 24 of the particles still can be within Rg at T  11
Gyr The mean z of the dust particles can increase from
024 kpc at T  0 Gyr to 245 kpc at T  028 Gyr to
577 kpc at T  11 Gyr for the graphite particles These re-
sults conrm the earlier result F91 that graphite can move
faster than silicate and thus can escape from galaxies under
the strong radiation pressure of stars
The key factor that can control the dynamical evolution
of dust in galaxies is the ratio  of radiation pressure force
to gravitational one

values of fH2 and SFR respectively For comparison the models without dust-related physics is shown as WO RP without radiation

This  parameter is dierent between silicate and graphite
because it depends on the adopted dierent dust mass den-
sities and sizes
  R2
dustmdust  R1
dust1
Therefore the  value is larger for graphite for the adopted
dust lower for graphite and Rdust smaller for graphite so
that graphite can be more strongly inuenced by radiation
pressure of stars in galaxies
As a result of radiation-driven dust transfer the radial
density proles of these dust particles can change signi-
cantly within the  1 Gyr dynamical evolution of the disk
Fig 3 shows that the nal distribution of the silicate parti-
cles at T  11 Gyr is more attened than the initial expo-
nential prole adopted in this model The nal distribution
for the inner halo region R  20  30 kpc is more similar
to the observed prole of dust dust  R08 by Menard
et al 2010 M10 The nal prole of the graphite particles
within the inner halo region is even more attened and there-
fore very similar to the observed at prole of dust M10
These results strongly suggest that the spatial distributions
of many dierent dust species can be heavily inuenced by
radiation pressure of stars in galaxies Furthermore given
that our previous simulations without radiation pressure of
stars B13a failed to explain the observational results by
M10 these results imply that the origin of the very at dis-
tribution of halo dust can be closely related to the exertion
of stellar radiation pressure on dust grains
As shown in Fig 4 the newly produced silicate parti-
cles ie SNIa SNII and AGB dust do not clearly show
the attened density proles at the selected three time steps
One reason for this is that these dust particles are born in
the very thin gas disk at small z where the dust particles
can not be levitated to a great extent by stellar radiation
pressure owing to the deeper gravitational potential The
other reason is that these younger particles have not had
enough time to travel to the outer halo region at T  11
Gyr These results imply that there could be some dier-
ences in the spatial distributions of dust grains that were
formed in a galaxy at dierent epochs The mass fraction
of silicate that can escape from the galaxy within 11 Gyr
evolution is 00007 for SNIa 00012 for SNII and 00002 for
AGB The nal mean z for SNIa SNII and AGB dust are
14 15 and 13 kpc respectively It is interesting to note
that the vertical distribution of SNII dust is slightly thicker
than those of other dust types
The derived outward transport of dust in the disk sug-
gests that radiation pressure of old disk stars can atten the
radial gradients of D Furthermore this outward transport
could be a new mechanism of metal-enrichment process in
the very outer parts of galactic gas disks if dust can be de-
stroyed and then returned back to ISM there The ejection of
dust into the outer halo region of a galaxy means that both
the mean D and dust-to-metal-ratio Dz of the gas disk of
the galaxy can be lowered signicantly The observed large
scatter in D for a given gas-phase abundance eg Galametz
et al 2011 could be also closely associated with this dust
ejection process Since this radiation-driven dust wind is not
considered in previous one-zone chemical evolution models
with dust eg D98 Inoue 2003 D and Dz evolution would
need to be re-investigated in future one-zone models for dust
evolution
In the present simulations the mass of each dust par-
ticle md is rather small in comparison with those of other
components DM stars and gas For example the initial
mass of an old dust particle in the ducial MW-type disk
model is only 06 006 of the gas star particle mass
md  36  102 M The mass-ratio of dust to gas star
can also become rather small for newly formed SNIa SNII
and AGB dust particle because i the masses of these dust
particles are only small portions of their parent gas particles
and ii the signicant fraction of dust can be consumed by
star formation and destroyed by SNe
However md can become much larger than their initial

size of a galaxy is shown for each model
values in some local regions owing to dust growth Accord-
ingly the mass range of dust particles can be quite large
in a simulation For example md for SNII dust can range
from 38  101 M to 19  103 M for the ducial MW
disk model The average md for SNII dust produced dur-
ing  1 Gyr evolution of the MW model is 18  102 M
and the above very low-mass SNII dust particle is very rare
In spite of this large mass dierence the gravitational soft-
ening length is xed at a same value among all baryonic
components
This means that the dust particles could be dynami-
cally heated up ie have more randomized motions after
they encounter with much more massive stellar and gaseous
and dark matter particles Although this possible heating
of dust particles can be an undesired numerical artifact in
the present study such a dynamical heating eg the for-
mation of very thick dust disk can not be clearly seen in an
isolated MW-type disk model Therefore it is safe for us to
conclude that the transfer of dust to the outer halo regions
shown in Figs 1 and 2 are due to the eects of radiation
pressure on dust not due to the numerical heating caused
by particles with vastly dierent masses
It should be also noted here that the dust destruction by
warmhot halo gas in galaxies is not included in the present
simulations This means that the extension of dusty halo
caused mainly by radiation pressure of stars might be over-
estimated Dust moving fast in the warmhot gaseous halo
of a galaxy might be destroyed eciently eg F91 Bianchi
 Ferrara 2005 so that the total mass of dust in the galac-
tic halo can be reduced signicantly As a result of this the
outer prole of the dust mass density become steeper in the
model with dust destruction by the gaseous halo This pos-
sible eect of gaseous halos of galaxies on dust will need to
be investigated in detail by our future studies

Fig 5 describes how the nal projected density proles of old
dust particles at T  11 Gyr in the inner halo region  30
kpc for the MW-type disk model depend on the adopted At
total dust extinction dust types silicate or graphite ini-
tial stellar ages of old disk stars t0 and frequency-averaged
radiation pressure coecient Q
pr Firstly the models with
larger At show steeper radial proles of silicate mainly be-
cause the higher degrees of dust extinction severely weakens
the stellar radiation pressure on dust so that the spatial
distribution of dust can not change signicantly This de-
pendence can be clearly seen in the models with graphite
though the distribution of graphite is more attened than
that of silicate for all models with dierent At Secondly
the models with younger ages of old stars in disks show at-
ter density proles of dust this is conrmed to be true for
graphite The reason for this is that the stronger radiation
pressure of younger stars in a disk can cause the ecient
radial transfer of dust to the outer region of the disk
Thirdly the models with larger Qpr show atter radial
proles of dust because dust with larger Qpr can be more
strongly inuenced by stellar radiation pressure The outer
radial proles of dust and fesc also depend on At dust types
t0 and Q
pr For example fesc for graphite in the MW model
with Av  03 mag is 007 which is about 35 of the same
model with At  0 mag shown in Fig 2 Fig 6 describes
the time evolution of the spatial distribution of graphite for
the MW model with At  03 mag In spite of reduced stellar
radiation pressure some fraction of dust particles still can
escape from the galaxy to locate outside rvir at T  11 Gyr
The nal slope of the attened density prole at R  50
kpc appears to be rather similar to the observed one by
M10 which again suggests that the origin of the observed
at dust distribution can be caused by radiation-driven dust
Fig 7 describes the time evolution of the spatial dis-
tribution of silicate for the MW model with a larger dust
extinction At  1 mag and radiation pressure Although
the outer distribution of dust is rather attened owing to the
outward transfer of dust the attening is due largely to the
extended disk of dust The dusty wind to the vertical direc-
tion can not be clearly seen in this model because the dust
extinction of stellar light by the dusty disk can weaken the
stellar light and thus prevent the radiation pressure from
pushing out dust particles to a large extent This derived
importance of At implies that the levels of dust extinction
dependent on local properties of ISM need to be more self-
consistently modeled so that dust dynamics driven by stellar
radiation pressure in galaxies can be more self-consistently
investigated in our future studies
Since the dust surface densities of disk galaxies can
change signicantly owing to the radiation-driven dust wind
or dust levitation the formation eciency of H2 H2  on
dust grins can also evolve with time The severe reduction of
dust mass densities in disks results in lower fH2 in most mod-
els with non-zero Q
pr in the present study The lower fH2
means lower SFRs in the disks because the present study
adopted the H2-dependent SF recipe Fig 8 demonstrate
how the SFHs of disk galaxies can be inuenced by strong
radiation pressure of stars in the 12 MW-type disk models
with dierent parameters The following ve key parameter
dependences are found for these representative models
Firstly the models with smaller At show systematically
lower SFRs because stronger radiation elds can lower the
dust mass densities of the disks and thus more severely sup-
press star formation in H2 gas clouds Secondly the models
with graphite show lower SFRs than those with silicate be-
cause graphite can be more strongly inuenced by radiation
pressure of stars so that the mass densities of graphite in the
disks become lower The dependence of SFRs on At found
in the models with silicate can be clearly seen in the mod-
els with graphite Thirdly the models with younger ages of
old stars in the disks show lower SFRs for a given At The
model with t0 At10 Gyr mag is not shown in this g-
ure because SFR becomes almost 0 in the model even from
the early stage of disk evolution because almost all dust is
expelled from the disk owing to the very strong radiation
pressure of young stars The young disk model with more
severe dust extinction ie t0 At11 Gyr mag shows
lower SFRs in the early stage of disk evolution T  06
Gyr which implies that star formation can be severely sup-
pressed by radiation pressure in young disk galaxies at high
z It is interesting that the model shows higher SFRs at later
times when the radiation eld becomes much weaker and the
disk still has a plenty of gas
pr  20 than Q
Fourthly SFRs can become lower in the model with
pr  05 because dust is more eciently
removed from the thin disks in the model with larger Q
so that H2 mass densities can become lower too The model
with Q
pr  0 corresponds to no radiation pressure and ac-
cordingly this model shows the highest SFRs at T  02 Gyr
among the 12 models Owing to the more rapid H2 consump-
tion by star formation at T  02 Gyr this model shows
lower SFRs in later times These results in Fig 8 clearly
demonstrate that i radiation pressure on dust grains can
reduce SFRs in galactic disks and ii the level of this SFR
reduction and H2 formation eciencies on dust grains de-
pends on the physical parameters of the disks and dust Fig
9 summarizes the levels of SFR and fH2 reduction due to
stellar radiation pressure on dust grains for the 12 represen-
tative models Clearly both the mean and maximum fH2
and SFR can become lower in the models with radiation
pressure
In real disk galaxies their interstellar dust is composed
of dust grains with dierent compositions and sizes Further-
more the ages of old populations in a disk galaxy should be
quite diverse depending on its formation history and thus
can not be represented by a single age Accordingly the
above models with a single t0 and either only silicate or
only graphite would be rather idealized and less realistic
Therefore it should be stressed here that the 12 models are
used for illustrating the possible eects of radiation pressure
on SFHs of galaxies We will discuss how radiation pressure
of stars can inuence galaxy-wide SFHs and H2 evolution
in a more convincing manner by using a galaxy formation
model based on CDM model in our forthcoming papers
32 Other models
321 Low-mass disk models
It is conrmed that the inuences of stellar radiation pres-
sure on dust distributions fH2 evolution and SFHs derived
for the MW-type disk models are seen also in the LMC-
type and Dwarf-type low-mass disk models Accordingly we
briey describe the results of these models here The evo-
lution of dust distributions in these low-mass disks can be
more strongly inuenced by radiation pressure of old stars
Galaxy evolution regulated by dust
owing to the shallower gravitational potential Fig 10 clearly
demonstrates that all dust components old SNIa SNII and
AGB in the LMC-type disk model with radiation pressure
show atter radial density proles in comparison with the
model without radiation pressure The old dust have a at-
ter nal distribution than other dust components which is
seen in the MW-type disk model too
As shown in Fig 10 these important roles of radiation-
driven dust wind found in the LMC-type disk models can
be clearly seen in the Dwarf-type disk models though the
dierence of AGB dust distributions between the models
with and without radiation pressure is less clear The less
clear attening of dust distribution for AGB dust is due to
the later formation of dust in these models with rather low
SFRs These results imply that the present result on the key
role of stellar radiation pressure on the evolution of dust
distributions in galaxies can be universal among galaxies
with dierent masses These also suggest that the halos of
low-mass disk galaxies can contain a large amount of dust
owing to dust wind driven by stellar radiation pressure if
the possibly warm halo gas can not destroy the ejected dust
so eciently
322 Massive bulge models
Fig 10 shows that the massive bulge model Sa-type with
stellar radiation pressure have atter density prole of dust
for all dust components However the slopes are not so at
as those derived for the LMC- and Dwarf-types disk models
because the deeper gravitational potential of the massive
bulge can prevent dust from escaping from the thin disk
Massive bulges in disk galaxies can suppress the formation
of molecular hydrogen in spiral arms B14 because they
can stabilize the disks against gravitational instability no
formation of strong spirals and bars Therefore star forma-
tion can be suppressed and the total amount of dust can not
rapidly increase The systematically lower dust mass densi-
ties in these models are due largely to the low production
rate of dust caused by lower SFRs These results combined
with those in the MW-type disk models imply that the 3D
distributions of dust in galactic halos could be dierent in
galaxies with dierent Hubble types
323 Other dust eects
We have so far focused on the results of the models that do
not include dust-related physics eg photo-electric heat-
ing and dust destruction by SNe other than stellar radi-
ation pressure on dust grains This is mainly because our
main purpose is to investigate how the stellar radiation
pressure which is not included in B13a can possibly in-
uence galaxy evolution The inuences of other each dust-
related physics on galaxy evolution will be separately dis-
cussed in our forthcoming papers Although photo-electric
heating PEH cosmic-ray heating CR dust-gas heating
DG gaseous drag of dust DR and dust destruction can
inuence the thermal history of gas and dust they can not
change the evolution of the 3D dust distribution so dramat-
ically than stellar radiation pressure RP this is indeed
conrmed in the present study
The essential role of stellar radiation pressure on dust
20 K Bekki
evolution can be seen in the models with RP PEH CR DR
DG and dust destruction The suppression of H2 formation
and star formation by radiation pressure of stars can be
seen in these models though other dust-related physics can
signicantly modify the suppression eects Fig 11 shows a
number examples of key eects of these dust-related physics
on SFHs of disk galaxies The gaseous drag DR in the
model without RP yet with DR can prevent dust particles
from escaping from the thin gas disk where star formation
can occur so that the SFR can be slightly higher in the
model than in the model without RP and DR The model
with PEH shows a systematically low SFR owing to the
increased gaseous temperature in particular for T  104
K of cold ISM This suppression of SF by PEH can be seen
in the models with or without RP which implies that PEH
can play a key role in SFHs of galaxies This role of PEH
should be extensively explored in our future works
As shown in Fig 11 the model with all dust-related
physical processes shows the lowest SFR among the four
models This implies that if numerical simulations of galaxy
formation and evolution do not include dust physics prop-
erly then they could severely overestimate the galaxy-wide
SFRs Given that such dust eects on galactic SFHs can be
stronger in galaxies with lower masses the results in Fig 11
implies that the total stellar masses of low-mass disk galaxies
could have been overestimated in the previous simulations
of galaxy formation without dust It should be stressed that
these discussion on galactic SFHs is based on the adopted
H2-dependent SF models If SFRs are simply proportional
to total gas densities neutral  molecular hydrogen then
the inuences of dust-related physics on SFHs could be re-
duced to a large extent because SFRs do not depend on the
H2 evolution that is strongly inuenced by dust evolution
4 DISCUSSION
41 How can galactic chemical evolution be
possibly inuenced by dust evolution
The chemical evolution of galaxies can be inuenced largely
by their SFHs that are controlled by a number of physical
processes such as merging histories of galaxies stellar winds
by energetic feedback eects and molecular cloud formation
Given that dust grains are the major formation sites of H2
gas in galaxies the evolution of dust abundances compo-
sitions and sizes can be a key factor for H2 evolution and
thus for chemical evolution of galaxies Although a full in-
vestigation of this issue should be done in our future studies
with the present new code it would be instructive for the
present study to discuss the possible inuences of dust evolu-
tion in galactic chemical evolution briey Fig 12 shows the
time evolution of gas-phase metal abundances Zg metal
abundances of new stars Zns dust-to-gas-ratios D and
dust-to-metal-ratios Dz for the MW-type models without
radiation pressure WO RP and dierent fdest For com-
parison the results of the model without dust growth and
destruction are shown in this gure
Clearly the evolution of Zg Zns D and Dz depends
strongly on how much fraction of dust can be destroyed by
SNe in a star-forming cloud In the model with fdest  003
a larger fraction of dust can be returned back to ISM as
gas-phase metals owing to the more ecient dust destruc-
tion so that gas-phase metallicity Zg can increase more
rapidly and to a larger extent Because of the higher gas-
phase metallicity of the ISM the new stars can also have
higher metallicities Zns As a result of this D and Dz can
decrease with time in this model with higher fdest On the
other hand the model with low fdest 001 shows slower
increase in Zg and Zns and signicant increase in D and Dz
These results suggest that dust destruction by SNe in ISM
can greatly inuence the chemical evolution of galaxies
As shown in the present study the stellar radiation pres-
sure can levitate dust to the halo regions of galaxies where
gas densities are so low that dust can not eciently grow
The radiation pressure also can suppress the galaxy-wide
star formation and consequently slow down the chemical
enrichment processes of galaxies Therefore the stellar ra-
diation pressure on dust can inuence the time evolution of
Zg Zns D and Dz Fig 13 clearly demonstrates that Zg
and Zns can more slowly increase with time in the mod-
els with RP Although the model with a low fdust 001
shows a slow increase in D it shows a slight decrease of Dz
In this model gas-phase metallicity can steadily increase
due to star formation because ISM can not be so eciently
ejected into the halo region However dust-phase metallicity
can not increase so eciently through accretion of gas-phase
metals onto dust grains because a signicant fraction of dust
can be ejected into the halo region where gas density is low
Therefore the destruction of dust by SNe can lower Dz even
in this model with low fdest
Thus these results suggest that we need to carefully
model the dust-related physics in ISM of galaxies in or-
der to discuss the chemical evolution of galaxies One of
the most important parameters in the present new model is
fdest which needs to be determined by another sets of pc-
scale simulations of forming and evolving molecular clouds
with young stars and SNe Since fdest is dened for an en-
tire star-forming cloud with multiple SNe we can not simply
use the results of simulations for dust destruction by a sin-
gle SN event eg Nozawa et al 2003 Given that fdest can
so strongly inuence the time evolution of dust and metal
abundances it is doubtlessly our future study to determine
the reasonable range of fdest for galaxy-scale simulations
The best way to do so would be to compare the observed
scaling relation of dust properties such as a D-Zg relation
eg Galametz et al 2011 the corresponding simulations
with dierent fdest It would be also necessary for our fu-
ture theoretical works to search for the possible range of
fdest and its dependence on ISM properties based on sub-
pc-scale simulations of star-forming molecular clouds
42 Galaxy life slowed down by dust
The present study has rst shown that the radiation pressure
of stars on dust can suppress the galaxy-wide star formation
because the pressure can reduce the H2 mass fractions that
can control SFRs of galaxies This suggests that radiation-
driven dust wind can change the chemical evolution of disk
galaxies not only through the removal of some metals in the
disks Bekki  Tsujimoto 2014 but also through slowing
down the gas consumption by star formation thus the chem-
ical enrichment processes Accordingly the present study
implies that this slowed down lives of galaxies could be
Galaxy evolution regulated by dust

003 respectively For comparison the results for the model without dust growth and destruction are shown by a long-dashed line Since
there is no new star at T  0 the initial Zg value is plotted for Zns at T  0
Figure 13 The same as Fig 12 but for the MW-type disk model with stellar radiation pressure
one of key results of galaxy formation and evolution inu-
enced by interstellar dust The present study also suggests
that if numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evo-
lution do not include dust-related physical processes in a
self-consistent manner then they are likely to over-predict
the total gas mass converted into new stars
The present study however has shown that the level
of SF suppression by radiation-driven dust wind depends on
the adopted constant dust extinction of ISM and the dust
composition This implies that our future more sophisticated
models with a self-consistent model for radiative-transfer
of stellar light in dusty ISM which can properly predict
At variation in time and space would produce dierent re-
sults Furthermore the SF suppression can be clearly seen
in the present simulations because SFRs are assumed to
depend on the mass densities of H2 the formation eciency
22 K Bekki
of which depends strongly on dust densities Accordingly if
SFRs depend on the total gas densities rather than H2 den-
sities then the SF suppression would not be so clear as the
present models have shown Thus the level of SF suppres-
sion by radiation-driven dust wind needs to be investigated
by our more sophisticated models with a fully self-consistent
treatment of stellar light inuenced by local dust
The possible inuences of dust on galaxy formation and
evolution revealed by the present study are summarized in
Table 6 Given that the present new model is still idealized
and less realistic in some points eg non-inclusion of dust
size distributions these possible inuences might be modi-
ed at least in a quantitative sense in more sophisticated
models for dust formation and evolution in galaxies Further-
more the present simulations are only for disk galaxies in
an isolated environment without no dynamical and hydro-
dynamical interaction with other galaxies Some unknown
inuences of dust on galaxy formation would be likely to be
found in numerical simulations of galaxy formation There-
fore such inuences of dust need to be re-investigated thor-
oughly in future numerical simulations of galaxy formation
with a self-consistent modeling of dust-related physical pro-
cesses in ISM
43 Future directions of the new live dust particle
The present new four-component chemodynamical code will
enable us to investigate various aspects of dust-aected
galaxy formation and evolution across the comic time The
proposed live dust particle method will make it possible for
us to discuss the dierent distributions of gas and dust in
galaxies the cosmic evolution of dust sizes and composi-
tions and the abundances of interstellar matters formed
on dust grains Below we briey discuss what we can in-
vestigate by using the new simulation code The gure in
Appendix C would be useful for readers of this paper to
understand the following discussion better
431 Dust-gas decoupling
B15 failed to reproduce the observed at proles of dust
halos of galaxies M10 because the model adopted in B15
did not include dust-gas decoupling processes in ISM eg
radiation pressure and dust-gas drag Furthermore the ob-
served rather high dust-to-gas-ratio D  005 which is
about 6 times larger than the solar neighborhood in the
outer halo of M81 by Xilouris et al 2006 was very di-
cult to be explained by B15 for the same reason As shown
in this paper the radial density prole of dust in a galaxy
can be attened by the eects of radiation pressure of stars
thus the outer halo can have higher D Therefore it is
doubtlessly worthwhile for our future studies to investigate
whether such an important eect of radiation pressure can
be clearly achieved in cosmological hydrodynamical simula-
tions of galaxy formation
432 Dust size distribution
The present chemodynamical model includes the six key
dust-related physical processes of galaxies ie dust forma-
tion mixing growth destruction consumption and cataly-
sis The formation of H2 on dust grains is one of important
interstellar chemistry processes on dust grains catalysis
that can be discussed in the present study The present new
live dust particle method combined with the proposed four-
component galaxy model DMstarsgasdust can pre-
dict dust and gas 3D distributions separately and distribu-
tions and kinematics of dierent dust species eg AGB and
SN dust separately too However the live particle method
is still less realistic in modeling some aspects of dusty ISM
such as the size evolution of dust and the coagulation process
of dust
The bottleneck of the new method is that the total num-
ber of dust particles can endlessly increase if the formation of
dust with dierent sizes and components in star-forming re-
gions and evolved stars is considered in a fully self-consistent
manner This means that the CPUGPU time required for
the calculation of dust physics at each time step of a sim-
ulation can become progressively longer as the simulation
proceeds The total number of dust particles ejected from a
single stellar particle Nej is 3 in the present study so that
the total number of particles N  can not dramatically in-
crease However if we investigate the time evolution of dust
sizes Nej would possibly need to be more than  100 to
represent a statistically enough sample of dust grains with
dierent sizes This means that we need to develop a fast
algorism for calculating the dust-related physics of ISM in
a simulation in order to consider the dust size evolution in
a self-consistent manner
433 Self-consistent SED construction
Constructing the SEDs for arbitrary 3D geometries of gas
dust and stars in galaxies based on theoretical and numer-
ical models of galaxy formation has been one of key ares
of theoretical studies of galaxies eg Bekki  Shioya 2000
2001 Jonsson 2006 Popescu  Tus 2013 These simulated
SEDs and those based on some phenomenological models
eg Dale et al 2001 are very useful in interpreting the
observed energy budgets eg fraction of infrared light of
dusty star-forming galaxies In order to estimate SEDs from
SSPs eg Bruzual  Charlot 2003 the previous stud-
ies needed to assume i dust-to-metal-ratios to drive dust
abundances from gas metallicities and ii dust size dis-
tribution for deriving the dust extinction curves If our
future simulations with the new live dust particle method
can predict dust size distributions properly then they do
not have to adopt the above assumption ii the above i
is explicitly derived in the present code already Thus the
self-consistent construction of SEDs based on dust size evo-
lution will be possible in our future studies
434 Dust-corrected cooling
Although the gas-phase metallicity that does not include
dust-phase metal of a gas particle should be used for es-
timating the radiation cooling rate of the gas in numeri-
cal simulations of galaxy formation and evolution the to-
tal ISM metallicity ie gas-phase  dust-phase metal
has been used in almost all simulations for cooling estima-
tion because dust was not included in the simulations Al-

though the present new model properly considered this dust-
corrected cooling process it did not include the possible
time-dependent IMF which can cause signicant changes in
dust evolution star formation histories and chemical evolu-
tion of galaxies eg Bekki 2013b Recchi  Kroupa 2015
Furthermore the present study did not consider the ra-
diative cooling rates that depend on both FeH on MgFe
De Rijcke et al 2013 thus on the detailed chemical evo-
lution of galaxies Given that the dust-depletion levels are
quite dierent between dierent elements eg Mg Fe and
Ca the present results might be changed to some extent
if the cooling rates by De Rijcke et al 2013 are adopted
Thus our future studies will need to include both tempo-
ral and spatial variations of IMFs and more sophisticated
cooling models De Rijcke et al 2013 in order to model the
thermal and dynamical evolution of ISM regulated dust in
a more self-consistent way
435 Dust destruction by multiple SNe
The present study has introduced a new parameter for the
mass fraction of dust destroyed by SNe fdest In the simu-
lation code the dust particles that are within less than Rdest
destruction radius from a SN are assumed to be destroyed
and consequently lose some fraction fdest of dust Since a
cluster of stars is formed from a gas particle the previous
results based on a model for dust destruction by a single
SN can not be simply used in the present model Given that
fdest can control chemical evolution of galaxies the possible
range of fdest in star-forming gas clouds with multiple SNe
exploding at dierent epochs needs to be investigated in our
future simulations
The mixing radius Rmix of ejected metals from SNe
and AGB stars and the dust destruction radius Rdest are
set to be the same in the present study The appropriate val-
ues for Rmix and Rdest are determined from the adopted spa-
tial resolution of a simulation ie from g However these
two could be signicantly dierent because dust destruction
processes might be more sensitive to physical properties of
ISM eg magnetic elds and gas shock speed Jones et al
1994 This means that we need to perform high-resolution
sub-pc scale numerical simulations on the dynamical evolu-
tion of dust and metals ejected from SNe and AGB stars in
galactic potentials The outputs from such simulations will
be able to be included in larger galaxy-scale simulations so
that we can investigate the dust-regulated galaxy formation
and evolution for reasonable ranges of Rmix and Rdest
436 Physical properties of interstellar ice and organic
Although we have so far focused on the formation of H2
on dust grains the surface of grains in ISM is crucial for
the formation and evolution of many dierent interstellar
species as catalysis such as ice and organic matter eg
Herbst  van Dishoeck 2009 Accordingly the present new
dust particle methods will enable us to predict the formation
eciency of many dierent species other than H2 by consid-
ering physical conditions of gas and dust and chemistry on
dust grains As a dust particle moves in ISM of a galaxy the
dust temperature the collision rates of atoms and molecules
the strength of ISRF and other physical properties of dust
and ISM can change If these time evolution of the physical
properties of the dust and its environments can be investi-
gated by our future simulations we will be able to predict
the time evolution of interstellar species eg organic mat-
ter Given that recent infrared observations have already
shown dierent abundances of H2O and CO2 ices in dier-
ent galaxies eg Shimonishi et al 2010 this prediction is
something that we should do not in far future but in near
future though the modeling of H2O and CO2 ices might be
a formidable task
5 CONCLUSIONS
We have developed a new four-component model of galaxy
evolution in which a galaxy consists of dark matter stars
gas and dust The dust component is represented by live
dust particles so that the present new model enables us to
investigate separately the evolution of gas and dustThe dust
particles are live in the following three senses Firstly dust
particles can gravitationally interact not only with other
components eg dark matter but also with other dust par-
ticles Secondly dust can be destroyed by SNe and reduce
signicantly its mass and also it can grow by accretion of
gas-phase metals in ISM Thirdly dust grains can be the for-
mation sites of water organic compounds and amino acid
closely related to the origin of life and accordingly we can
study the evolution of these interstellar matter essential for
life by using our new simulations in future
First we have described the details of the model and
discussed the limitations and advantages of the model in
investigating galaxy formation and evolution We then have
investigated the possible roles of dust in galaxy evolution by
24 K Bekki
using the new code and obtained some preliminary results
In particular we have tried to grasp the possible roles of
stellar radiation pressure on dust grains in the evolution of
dust gas-phase metals and star formation histories SFHs
of galaxies The preliminary results that we have obtained
in this study are briey summarized as follows
1 The radiation pressure of stars on dust in disk
galaxies can inuence the time evolution of 3D dust distri-
butions Dust particles in a disk galaxy can be levitated
from the initially thin disk and some fractions of dust can
escape from the disk to locate outside the virial radius
of its dark matter halo This dynamical evolution of dust
derived by stellar radiation strongly depends on the model
parameters such as stellar ages t0 total dust extinction
At dust composition eg silicate or graphite and
frequency-averaged radiation pressure coecient Q
2 The two basic roles of stellar radiation in the time
evolution of 3D dust distributions are i thickening of the
vertical structure of dust and ii attening of the radial
density prole The above four parameters eg At can
determine the degrees of these thickening and attening in
the mass distributions of dust For example the models
with higher At show a smaller degree of attening in the
dust distribution whereas those with younger disk ages ie
smaller t0 show a larger degree of the attening
3 Stellar radiation pressure can reduce the mass
density of dust in a galactic disk so that it can also reduce
the H2 formation eciency on dust grains As a result
of this the star formation rate SFR can be severely
reduced with the reduction level depending largely on
At It should be noted however that this suppression of
star formation by stellar radiation pressure is due to the
adopted assumption that SFRs depend on the mass density
of H2 gas not the total gas density in the present study
Therefore it is possible that the level of SF suppression by
radiation pressure is overestimated in the present study
4 The inclusion of other dust-related physical
processes such as photo-electric heating and gas-dust
heating does not change the present results on the roles
of stellar radiation pressure in galaxy evolution It is
found that photo-electric heating can suppress galaxy-wide
star formation in the models with and without radiation
pressure Furthermore gaseous drag of dust can lead to
the slight enhancement of galactic SFRs because the drag
can prevent dust from escaping from thin galactic disks
We need to conrm these interesting eects of dust on
galactic SFHs in our future studies by exploring a much
wider parameter space for dust-related physical processes
5 One of the most important parameters for the
evolution of dust and metal abundances is fdest which
is dened as the mass fraction of interstellar dust that is
destroyed by SNe in a star-forming gas cloud Although a
possibly reasonable value of fdest is  001 in the present
study this parameter is yet to be constrained so well by
observational and theoretical studies Given its importance
it is our future study to determine the possible range of
fdest and its dependence on the physical properties of
star-forming gas clouds
6 The present results suggest that although dust
does not inuence galaxy evolution so dramatically as
SN and AGN feedback eects do it can play signicant
roles in many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution
For example the removal of metals through dust wind
suppression of H2 formation due to dust removal and
photo-electric heating of gas by dust in ISM can inuence
chemical evolution star formation histories and stellar and
gas dynamics in galaxies respectively These roles of dust in
galaxy formation and evolution will need to be investigated
extensively in future theoretical studies of galaxies for
better understanding the formation and evolution processes
of galaxies
Thus the present new live dust particle method has
enabled us to reveal the possible inuences of dust-related
physical processes on galaxy evolution The dust properties
of galaxies have been derived in the post-processing of sim-
ulation data for almost all previous theoretical simulations
of galaxy formation and evolution eg derivation of dust
mass from metal mass by assuming dust-to-metal ratios
The present study suggests that this post-processing ap-
proach might not be realistic because dust itself can cause
signicant changes in galaxy evolution processes
The present new model is still somewhat idealized eg
non-inclusion of dust size distributions in ISM and there-
fore needs to be further improved so that we can properly in-
vestigate the physical properties of dust eg evolving dust
compositions and sizes as well as their eects on galaxy for-
mation and evolution in particular the evolution of galactic
SEDs and molecular gas fraction In our next paper we will
discuss how galaxy formation processes can be inuenced by
dust in a CDM cosmology by using a more sophisticated
live dust particle model

are slightly dierent between the four models This is again
encouraging because we can estimate a reasonable Rgrow
from the adopted gravitational softening length correspond-
ing to the initial spatial resolution of a simulation However
this rather weak dependence on Rgrow might be true only for
the present galaxy evolution simulations for isolated disks
Thus we need to conrm whether this is the case for other
models such as galaxy formation models based on a CDM
cosmology
APPENDIX C A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE
NEW CHEMODYNAMICAL MODEL
Fig C1 briey summarizes the key elements of the new four-
component chemodynamical model adopted in the present
numerical study of galaxy evolution The six key physi-
cal processes included in the code are i mixing of metals
and dust ejected from SNe and AGB stars ii dust for-
mation from condensation of metals in stellar winds of SNe
and AGB stars iii dust growth through accretion of gas-
phase metals onto already existing dust grains iv dust
destruction by SNe v H2 formation on dust grains from
neutral hydrogen catalysis and vi consumption of gas
and dust by star formation in molecular clouds in galaxies
The new model is quite dierent from previous standard
three-component chemodynamical model in the sense that
i dust-related physical processes are explicitly and self-
consistently included and ii inuences of dust evolution on
chemical evolution of gas-phase metals is considered The
improved predictability of the new code is discussed exten-
sively in the main text
APPENDIX A REQUIRED NUMBER OF DUST
PARTICLES
In the present live dust particle method the formation of H2
is possible only on the surface of dust grains in galactic ISM
Accordingly the time evolution of fH2 and SFHs of galaxies
depend on the dynamical evolution of dust It is therefore
possible that the present results on fH2 evolution and SFHs
of galaxies depend on the total number of dust particles
Ndust adopted in the present simulations In order to in-
vestigate this important issue we have run four comparative
MW-type disk models without stellar radiation pressure and
dierent Ndust and investigated whether the results depend
on Ndust
Fig A1 shows that the SFRs in MW-type disk galaxies
do not depend strongly on Ndust as long as Ndust  30000
30 of the total gas particle number The model with
Ndust  10000 appears to underestimate the SFR in the ini-
tial bursty star formation in the central region of the disk It
is conrmed that the nal spatial distributions of dust does
not depend strongly on Ndust either This weak dependence
on Ndust is very encouraging because we do not have to
adopt an excessively large number of dust particles to sim-
ulate the dust evolution of galaxies Thus we conclude that
the adopted number of Ndust is enough to investigate the
possible roles of dust in galaxy evolution
APPENDIX B DEPENDENCE ON RGROW
Dust growth via accretion of gas-phase metals onto already
existing dust grains and and dust destruction by SNe are
both assumed to proceed locally depending on the physical
conditions of ISM in the present study In order to imple-
ment these processes we have introduced a new parame-
ter Rgrow that denes the sphere of inuence within which
the dust accretion and destruction rates are calculated for
each dust particle based on the physical properties of gas
around the dust particle Since the present results can pos-
sibly depend strongly on this Rgrow we need to investigate
the possible dependence
Fig B1 clearly shows that galactic SFHs are qualita-
tively very similar between the MW-type disk models with
four dierent Rgrow though the SFRs at a given time step
