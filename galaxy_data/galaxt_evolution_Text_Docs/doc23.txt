Summary We discuss the origin of physical properties of globular cluster systems
GCSs in galaxies in terms of galaxy formation and evolution processes Based on
numerical simulations of dynamical evolution of GCSs in galaxies we particularly
discuss 1 the origin of radial density proles of GCSs 2 kinematics of GCSs in
elliptical galaxies 3 transformation from nucleated dwarf galaxies into GCs eg
omega Centauri and 4 the origin of GCSs in the Large Magellanic Cloud LMC
1 Numerical archeology
Based on penetrative analysis of metal-poor halo stars and globular clusters
GCs in the Galaxy two canonical Galaxy formation scenarios  the mono-
lithic collapse scenario 1 and the accretionmerging one 2 were proposed
that have long been inuential for later observational and theoretical studies
of disk and elliptical galaxies Although observational studies of stellar halos in
galaxies beyond the Local Group of galaxies have just recently started reveal-
ing structural and chemical properties of the halos 34 physical properties
of globular cluster systems GCSs in these galaxies have long been investi-
gated in much more details 5 Wide-eld imaging and spectroscopic studies
with large ground-based telescopes eg Keck 10m have recently revealed
GCS structures and kinematics in galaxies with dierent Hubble types 6
Furthermore a growing number of theoreticalnumerical studies have recently
been accumulated which have investigated dynamical and chemical properties
of GCs and GCSs based on admittedly realistic and self-consistent models of
GC formation during galaxy formation and evolution 78 In this review
paper we therefore try to derive physical meanings from the selected four ob-
served properties of GCs and GCSs by comparing our numerical simulations
of GC and GCS formation with latest observations

2 GCS density proles
It has long been known that the radial density proles of GCSs in elliptical
galaxies Es vary with the total luminosities of their host galaxies 9 If the
projected GCS density proles in Es with V -band absolute magnitudes of MV
gc  where R is the distance from
are tted to the power-law ones like gc  R
the center of the host galaxy of a GCS the power-law index gc is smaller
ie the proles are steeper for larger MV ie fainter Es Although two
physical mechanisms  GC destruction by galactic tidal elds 1011 and
dynamics of galaxy merging Bekki  Forbes 2006 BF06 12  have been
so far proposed for the origin of GCS density proles we focus on the latter
case in this paper
BF06 numerically investigated the structural properties of GCSs in Es
formed from a sequence of major dissipationless galaxy merging and thereby
Imprint of galaxy formation on GCs
found that the radial density proles of GCSs in Es become progressively
atter as the galaxies experience more major merger events See Figure 1
The simulated proles of GCSs are found to be well described as power-laws
with gc ranging from 20 to 10 in Es They are atter than and linearly
proportional to the slopes s of the stellar density proles By applying a
reasonable scaling relation between luminosities and sizes of galaxies to the
simulation results BF06 showed that gc  036MV  92 rc  185MV
and gc  093s These correlations between GCS proles and their host
galaxy luminosities are consistent reasonably well observations 139 which
suggests that the origin of structural non-homology of GCSs in Es can be
understood in terms of the growth of Es via major dissipationless galaxy
merging

R  6Re for metal-poor clusters MPCs These correlations are derived from 18
results of 6 major merger models with three dierent projections 18
3 GCS kinematics in ES0s
Recent observations on GCS kinematics in ES0s have revealed that GCS
kinematics can be quite diverse GCSs in some galaxies like M87 14 NGC
4472 15 and NGC 5128 16 show rotation whereas those in some galaxies
such as NGC 1399 17 do not Bekki et al 2005 B05 18 rst tried to
understand the observed diversity in GCS kinematics by numerically investi-
gating GCS kinematics of ES0s formed from majorminor galaxy merging
B05 demonstrated that both metal-poor cluster MPCs and metal-rich ones
MRCs in Es formed from major mergers can exhibit signicant rotation at
large radii 20 kpc due to the conversion of initial orbital angular momen-
tum into intrinsic angular momentum of the remnant
Kenji Bekki
Based on a wide parameter study of galaxy mergers B05 found that MPCs
show higher central velocity dispersions than MRCs for most major merger
models Vm0 where Vm and 0 are the GCS maximum rotational velocity
and central velocity dispersion respectively ranges from 02 10 and 0109
for the MPCs and MRCs respectively within 6Re for the remnant elliptical
Figure 2 shows an interesting result that does not depend on merger param-
eters Vm0 of MPCs within 6Re are greater than those of MPCs within
B05 also revealed the alignment of the major axes in 2D distributions
between stars GCs and dark matter halos in the simulated Es The aligned
major axis between stars GCs and dark matter appears to be one of the
principal characteristics of Es formed by major merging which implies that
observational studies on 2D distributions of GCSs in Es can tell us about the
shapes of their host dark matter halos We also showed in this meeting that the
total masses of ES0s estimated from the GCS kinematics can be much closer
to the real masses than those from the PNe systems owing to less anisotropic
velocity dispersion in GCSs in particular for face-on S0s This suggests that
1 GCSs are better mass-estimators in ES0s and 2 kinematical data sets of
PNe systems in ES0s 19 should be more carefully interpreted for the total
masses of ES0s Although these simulations are not based on cosmological
N-body ones these results may well provide new insight on the origin of the
observed diversity in GCS kinematics of ES0s

4 The age gap problem in the LMC
Possible candidates of young and metal-rich GCs were discovered in inter-
acting and merging galaxies 20 and physical properties of these GCs have
been discussed in dierent contexts of galaxy and GC formation such as the
observed color bimodality in GCSs in Es 9 the birth rate of young GCs as a
function of time in M82 21 and the age-metallicity relation of GCs in nearby
interacting galaxies like the LMC and the SMC eg Bekki et al 2004 B04
22 In this paper we focus on the LMCs GCS in which nearly all GCs are
either very old  13 Gyr or younger than 3  4 Gyr  the age-gap problem
2324
B04 and Bekki  Chiba 2005 25 challenged this age gap problem by
investigating chemodynamical evolution of the LMC interacting both with the
Galaxy and the SMC for a long time scale  9 Gyr They found that the
rst close encounter between the LMC and the SMC about 4 Gyr ago was the
beginning of a period of strong tidal interaction witch likely induced dramatic
gas cloud collisions leading to an enhancement of the GC formation which
has been sustained by strong tidal interactions to the present day Figure 3
showing the simulated age distributions of eld stars and GCs in a model
reveals that GC formation can be reactivated about 3  4 Gyr ago when
the LMC can start its strong tidal interaction with the SMC These results
imply that the origin of the age gap can be closely associated with interaction
histories of the LMC the SMC and the Galaxy
5 Very massive star clusters
Very massive star clusters VMSCs such as  Centauri ultra-compact dwarfs
UCDs and massive nuclear star clusters have unique characteristics that are
quite dierent from those of normal GCs For example UCDs discovered
in the Fornax and the Virgo clusters of galaxies 262728 have intrinsic
sizes of less than 100 pc and have absolute Bband magnitudes ranging from
13 to 11 mag which is more than 2 magnitudes brighter than the most
massive GC in the Galaxy ie  Cen Two physical mechanisms for the
VMSC formation have been so far proposed The Galaxy threshing scenario
2930 in which VMSCs originate from nuclei of nucleated dwarf galaxies and
the cluster merging one in which VMSCs are formed from merging of smaller
star clusters in tidal tails of merging galaxies 31 Although more details on
physical properties of VMSCs have been recently revealed 3233 it remains
unclear which of the two scenarios is more convincing for the origin of VMSCs
Here we discuss what we can learn from VMSC properties if they were
previously nuclei of nucleated galaxies Both dissipationless 3435 and dis-
sipative 36 formation scenario of stellar galactic nuclei have provided some
interesting predictions on nuclear properties of galaxies 37 Figure 4 shows
the scaling relations between dierent physical parameters of merger remnants

absolute magnitude for the VMSCs in 40 models 22 Projected central velocity
dispersion 0 upper left half-light-averaged surface brightness Ie upper right
eective radius Re lower left and central surface brightness I10 lower right
are plotted against MV Here the central surface brightness I10 is expressed as
2 where L R10 are the total luminosity of a VMSC and the radius
01LR10
within which 10 of L is included respectively The best t scaling relation for the
VMSCs is derived for each panel using the least square tting method and described
as a dotted line with the derived relation eg 0  L031
of star clusters initially with the observed GC scaling relations 38 The fact
that the simulated relations deviate from the GCs ones implies that the scaling
relations of VMSCs can be used for understanding whether the stellar nuclei
can be formed from merging of many smaller clusters in the central regions of
galaxies 39 The dissipative nucleus formation model 37 has predicted the
spread of ages and metallicities in stellar populations of stellar galactic nuclei
and accordingly can be discussed in the context of the observed spread of ages
and metallicities in  Cen 32 Thus dynamical and chemical properties of
VMSCs can tell us about nucleus formation histories in galaxies

6 Future works Hierarchical galaxy formation and GCSs
Thus structural kinematical and chemical properties of GCSs in galaxies
have fossil information on dynamics of majorminor galaxy merging eg an-
gular momentum redistribution processes in merging interaction histories of
galaxies and the formation histories of stellar galactic nuclei in dwarfs Pre-
vious theoreticalnumerical studies however did not discuss so extensively the
observed correlations between GCS properties and their host ones 6 in the
context of a hierarchical clustering scenario of galaxy formation Several au-
thors just recently have started their investigation on the GCS-host relations
based on semi-analytic models 40 and high-resolution numerical simulations
in CDM models 4142 A number of observed GCS-host relations such
as the positive correlation between GCS metallicities and their host galaxy
luminosities 6 have not been clearly explained by any galaxy formation sce-
narios Since these GCS-host relations may have profound physical meanings
on galaxy formation and evolution it is doubtlessly worthwhile for future nu-
merical simulations of GCS formation to explore the origin of these relations
