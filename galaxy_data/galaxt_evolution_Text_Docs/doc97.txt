ABSTRACT
We explore the distribution of mass about the expected sites of galaxy formation in a high-resolution
hydrodynamical simulation of a CDM cosmology which includes cooling star-formation and feedback
We show that the evolution of the galaxy bias is non-trivial and non-monotonic and that the bias
is stochastic We discuss the galaxy-mass cross-correlation function and highlight problems with the
interpretation of galaxy-galaxy lensing as due to extended dark matter halos around typical galaxies
Finally we show that the external shear around strong gravitational lenses is likely to be closely
aligned with the direction of the nearest massive galaxy and to have a power-law distribution which can
be predicted from the galaxy auto-correlation function
Subject headings cosmology theory  large-scale structure of Universe
INTRODUCTION
The distribution of galaxies with respect to the total
mass in the Universe remains a central unsolved prob-
lem in cosmology though one which is becoming increas-
ingly amenable to theoretical modeling and ever more con-
strained observationally In particular gravitational lens-
ing allows us to probe the spatial distribution of the mass
in the Universe for example around galaxies and in clus-
ters of galaxies In this paper we present predictions for
the distribution of mass around sites of galaxy formation
using a hydrodynamic simulation of structure formation
which includes cooling star-formation and feedback We
believe such simulations can provide ab initio and robust
predictions for the statistical distribution of the sites of
galaxy formation even though the detailed star forma-
tion rates and galaxy morphologies are sensitive to uncer-
tain sub-resolution physics As such these simulations
can be used to predict from rst principles the galaxy
auto-correlation function the galaxy-mass cross correla-
tion function which is the key ingredient in galaxy-galaxy
lensing studies and the mass auto-correlation function
Originally regarded as an interesting but not practically
useful prediction of Einsteins theory of general relativity
gravitational lensing has become a standard tool in ob-
servational cosmology Strong gravitational lensing has
a long history and weak lensing of background galaxies
by clusters of galaxies is now well established Just re-
cently the weak lensing of galaxies by large-scale structure
has been observationally demonstrated van Waerbeke et
al 2000 Bacon et al 2000 Kaiser et al 2000 Wittman et
al 2000 Maoli et al 2001 Rhodes et al 2001 at about
the level predicted by theories based on gravitational in-
stability in a cold dark matter CDM dominated universe
The weak lensing observations probe the projected dis-
tribution of mass in the Universe directly without refer-
ence to the distribution of light This provides us with di-
rect constraints on the dark matter auto-correlation func-
tion for which theoretical predictions are very well de-
veloped both analytically and numerically on Mpc scales
By contrast galaxy redshift surveys can give us detailed
three-dimensional information about the distribution of
luminous matter providing us with a measure of the
galaxy auto-correlation function and its evolution How-
ever galaxy formation is still poorly understood mak-
ing interpretation of the full information contained in the
galaxy auto-correlation function dicult
Intermediate between these two are dark matter-galaxy
cross-correlations These can be measured whenever the
galaxy distribution is cross-correlated with a tracer of the
dark matter Some examples are galaxy-galaxy lensing
correlating galaxies and weak lensing shear foreground-
background galaxy correlations and galaxy-QSO correla-
tions correlating galaxies with weak lensing magnica-
tion All of these can be interpreted as a projection of the
galaxy-mass correlation function which we shall discuss
To understand the galaxy-mass cross-correlation requires
us to understand the environments of galaxies but not
necessarily the detailed properties of the galaxies them-
selves
Another probe of the mass distribution around galax-
ies comes from strong gravitational lensing Although
the central regions of the primary lens galaxy whose spa-
tial structure is not well modeled by current calculations
dominates the monopole gravity in a strong lens the
quadrupole and to a lesser extent the higher poles has
a signicant contribution from the external shear or tidal
gravity near the lens or along the line-of-sight All lens-
ing models require this degree of freedom Barkana 1996
Keeton Kochanek  Seljak 1997 and in some cases the
dominant source can be clearly identied with a nearby
galaxy
The outline of this paper is as follows we review the
simulation we shall use in 2 giving details of how we
identify galaxies and their parent halos The evolution of
clustering in the simulation is discussed in 3 and we in-
troduce our primary tool the correlation function in 4
The implications of our simulation for the interpretation
of galaxy-galaxy lensing is dealt with in 5 Models of ex-
ternal shear for strong lensing are dealt with in 6 Finally
in 7 we summarize our ndings
2 THE SIMULATION
Throughout we shall use a new simulation of the Os-
triker  Steinhardt 1995 concordance model which has
m  03   07 H0  100 h kms1Mpc1 with
h  067 B  004 n  1 and 8  09 correspond-
ing to H  502  105 This model yields a reasonable
t to the current suite of cosmological constraints and as
such provides a good framework for making realistic pre-
dictions
We have used the TreeSPH code Gadget Springel
Yoshida  White 2001 to run a 2  3003  54 million
particle simulation of this model in a periodic box of size
335 h1Mpc Equal numbers of gas and dark matter par-
ticles were employed so mdark  10  108 h1M and
mgas  15  107 h1M The gravitational interaction
between particles is softened on small scales using a cu-
bic spline eg Hernquist  Katz 1989 and the Plummer
equivalent gravitational softening in our simulation was
6 h1kpc xed in comoving coordinates The simulation
was started at redshift z  99 and evolved to z  0 Unfor-
tunately the simulation box is too small to reliably predict
clustering properties at very low redshifts as the funda-
mental mode becomes increasingly non-linear for z  1
Hence in this paper we restrict our analysis to redshifts
z  05
In addition to the gravitational interactions and adia-
batic hydrodynamics the code follows radiative cooling
Fig 1 The projected mass density in the vicinity of the largest
group in the simulation at z  07 The grey scale indicates the
projected gas density in h1Mh1Mpc2 within a cube of side
3h1Mpc centered on the most bound particle in the group Small
knots of dense gas which we identify as sites of galaxy formation
can be seen clearly Like many large groups this one is part of a
large lamentary structure which explains the spatial orientation
of the distribution of sub-halos
and heating processes in the presence of a UV radiation
eld in essentially the same way as described in Katz
Weinberg  Hernquist 1996 We model the UV radi-
ation eld using a modied Haardt  Madau 1996 spec-
trum with reionization occuring at z  6 see eg Dave
et al 1999 and with an amplitude chosen to reproduce
the mean opacity of the Lyman-alpha forest at z  3 eg
Rauch et al 1997 Star formation and feedback is han-
dled using a modication of the multi-phase model of
Yepes et al 1997 and Hultman  Pharasyn 1999 Each
SPH particle is assumed to describe a co-spatial uid of
ambient hot gas condensed cold clouds and stars Hydro-
dynamics is followed for only the hot gas phase but the
cold gas and stars are subject to gravity add inertia and
participate in mass and energy exchange processes with
the ambient gas phase The algorithm will be described in
more detail in a forthcoming paper
From the simulation outputs we have constructed cat-
alogues of halos and their sub-halos using the algorithm
Subfind described in detail in Springel et al 2000 First
the Friends-of-Friends algorithm with a linking length of
015n13 is used to dene a parent halo catalogue and
then bound sub-halos within each parent are identied
Sub-halos are dened as locally overdense gravitation-
ally bound structures These sub-halos typically consist
of cold dense gas at their center surrounded by a halo
of dark matter and tenuous hot gas The halo may be
severely truncated if the sub-halo is not the central galaxy
in the parent halo but the dense gas that has been able
to eciently cool and form stars should allow a reliable
identication with galaxies in the real Universe at least
statistically see Fig 1
We have used a linking length of 015 rather than the
more canonical 02 in dening the parent halos because
we found for the larger linking length two neighboring but
distinct halos were frequently linked into one parent halo
with one of them then identied as a sub-halo of the other
While this problem is not eliminated entirely using a link-
ing length of 015 it is signicantly reduced Only very

close halo pairs or triplets possibly in the process of merg-
ing are joined with this linking length In some instances
the FOF algorithm nds halos which are not bound these
halos have in general very small particle number and are
not included in the analysis Results from the halo nding
are shown in Table 1
For each halo or sub-halo we dene the center as the
position of the particle with the minimum potential en-
ergy with the potential calculated using only the group
particles This denition usually corresponds very closely
to the most bound and densest particles and is more ro-
bust than the center of mass Many denitions of mass are
possible and can dier from each other quite signicantly
eg White 2001 Although counting the particles within
the FOF group is the simplest we have chosen to follow a
more commonly used approach where the mass is dened
as that enclosed within a radius inside of which the mean
density is 500 times the critical density An alternative
denition could use the background density rather than
the critical density The two scale dierently with redshift
except for cosmologies with critical matter density At the
redshifts at which we are working the density contrast with
respect to background scales as cid2m  1  z3cid3
In Fig 2 we show a scatter plot of the masses of the
sub-halos and their parent halos at z  1 Most of the ha-
los are isolated and have parent halo masses fractionally
larger than the sub-halo masses As the parent halos be-
come more massive there is less chance that it hosts only
one galaxy In our rst pass through we found that there
are a very small number of systems where the sub-halo
mass exceeds the parent halo mass This can arise in situ-
ations where several halos are merging with the bridging
material being at low density If the most bound particle
in the group lies at the center of a less massive sub-halo our
denition of mass M500 returns the mass of this sub-halo
as the parent mass In such cases we replace the par-
ent mass with the sum of the sub-halo masses to more
accurately reect the total mass of the system
Ideally we would identify the sub-halos as galaxies by
some observational property such as luminosity or color
Unfortunately it is dicult to reliably compute such prop-
erties from this simulation because the outputs are too in-
frequent to graft on population synthesis codes However
we do give in addition to the total mass of a sub-halo
log10M500M

results as a function of the stellar mass within r500 of the
sub-halo center We do this under the assumption that
the near infrared magnitude of a galaxy should roughly
track its stellar mass eg Cole et al 2001 The mass
weighted mean age of the stars at each output is given in
Table 3 to help with this conversion Finally to help in
matching our halos to observed galaxies we give the num-
ber density of our halos as a function of z in Fig 3 As
a rst approximation and in the absence of further infor-
mation one can match halos of a given mass to objects of
an equivalent space density
3 THE CLUSTERING OF SUB-HALOS
We are interested in the clustering of galaxies and dark
matter and its evolution with time within this simulation
We show in Fig 4 the dark matter1 power spectra at z  4
3 2 and 1 To compute these power spectra we estimated
the dark matter density eld from the particles using NGP
assignment Hockney  Eastwood 1988 onto a 2563 grid
The density eld was then Fourier Transformed to obtain
k The power spectrum was obtained by binning k2 in
shells in k-space corrected for the binning the mass as-
signment onto the grid and shot-noise see eg Peacock 
Dodds 1996 for a discussion of some of these issues To
extend the calculation to higher k we repeated the process
several times rescaling the particle separations by increas-
ing factors and remapping the distribution into the peri-
odic volume each time Peacock private communication
Jenkins et al 1998 This provides us with an estimate of
P k limited only by the resolution of the simulation and
not by the size of the Fourier transform grid
Compared to semi-analytic estimates of the expected
power Peacock  Dodds 1996 we nd that this box has a
slight shortfall To check whether the semi-analytic model
correctly estimates the dark matter power spectrum for
this model we have run two additional dark matter only
simulations each using 2563 particles The rst simulation
is in a 200h1Mpc box and the second in a 100h1Mpc
box The power spectra computed from the z  1 outputs
of these runs in the same manner as above are also shown
in Fig 4 We see that the tting function has slightly less
power than the simulation at small scales as seen also in
the simulations of Jain Mo  White 1995 The power
spectrum in our 335h1Mpc box is low on all scales at the
redshifts of interest although the shape is approximately
correct Fluctuations in the amplitude but not the shape
of the power spectrum due to nite volume eects are well
known eg Meiksin  White 1999 Part of the shortfall
in power is due to the particular random phases chosen in
the initial conditions the remainder is due to the fact that
the box is becoming less and less of a fair sample of the
Universe as time evolves and the non-linear scale increases
We show the latter eect by plotting in Fig 5 the growth
of the fundamental mode 2kf  compared with linear
theory As long as the box remains a fair sample of the
Universe the ratio 2kf D2z where Dz is the linear
growth factor should remain constant
In earlier work White et al 2001 we showed that the
number of galaxies per dark matter halo scaled approx-
1The power spectrum of the gas mass follows the dark matter
 10hMpc1 The stellar particles are more
power spectrum to k
strongly clustered as expected

We show the mass function as a function of total mass squares
gas mass circles and stellar mass triangles In all cases the mass
quoted is M500 in h1 M see text
imately as a power-law in the parent halo mass with an
index less than 1 typically 07-08 This behavior is pre-
cisely what is needed to explain the observed clustering of
galaxies eg Scoccimarro et al 2000 and is also seen in
semi-analytic models eg Seljak 2000 The spatial dis-
tribution of sub-halos in the simulation is consistent with
the assumption that every halo hosts a galaxy which re-
sides at its center and any extra satellite galaxies trace the
dark matter distribution It remains an open question ob-
servationally whether the galaxy density traces the mass
density in halos eg Adami et al 2001
We performed a counts-in-cells analysis of both the mass
and galaxy number density elds as a function of redshift
First we divided the cubical box up into a grid of cells
with Nc  32 64 128 or 256 cells on a side We as-
signed each particle or galaxy to the appropriate cubical
cell weighting the particles by their mass and the galax-
ies equally For the galaxies we treated them as points
at the position of their potential minima This was done
8 times with the grid shifted to a random position each
time Then we calculated the variance of mass and galaxy
uctuations from which we can dene b  ggmm the
covariance b  2
mm and the cross-correlation coe-
cient r  2
gmggmm Our results are shown in Table 4
We see a clear tendency for the bias to be stochastic
with decreasing correlation between the galaxies and the
total mass as we probe smaller length scales
4 CORRELATION FUNCTION
We identify the center of a galaxy as the position of
the minimum of the potential of a bound sub-halo found
with Subfind Around each such center we calculate the
probability in excess of random of having mass M within

power spectrum for this model as estimated using the formalism of

solid symbols are the power spectra at z  1 from two 2563 DM only

spectra from the simulation in this work the 335h1Mpc hydro
simulation at z  1 2 3 and 4 top to bottom
Fig 5 The power in the fundamental mode vs linear theory
We plot the ratio of 2kf  to the linear growth factor Dz This
should be constant as long as the box is a fair sample of the Universe
The power begins to fall below the linear theory prediction at late
times because our periodic box is missing long-wavelength power on
scales larger than the fundamental mode which are not available to
be coupled into the evolution as kf goes non-linear

with M500  1010 h1M and the final column gives
the cross correlation coefficient We have stopped
at Nc  256 since to implement finer grids we would
need to use the extent of the sub-halos rather than
just their positions
a spherical shell of radius r and width dr Stellar mass
cold and hot gas mass and dark matter are all included
in this accounting We present our results in terms of the
correlation function which we dene as
gm 
M r dr
hM r dri
where M r dr is the mass contained within the shell be-
tween radius r and r  dr and h  i indicates an average
quantity To safely avoid numerical resolution eects we
shall consider galaxies only above 1010 h1M
We show in Fig 6 the correlation function of the mass
mmr the galaxies above 1010h1M ggr and the
galaxy-mass cross correlation gmr at z  1 2 and
3 The correlation functions are well described by power
laws with a slowly changing slope and on scales above a
few100h1kpc the galaxy-mass cross correlation function
is just the geometric mean of the mass-mass and galaxy-
galaxy autocorrelation functions see Fig 7 While the
mass correlation function grows steadily with time the
evolution of the galaxy correlation function is more com-
plicated We give the correlation length r0 dened as
r0  1 vs redshift in Table 5 Note that on length
scales approaching 1h1Mpc our box is missing power as
described above and so these correlation lengths are bi-
ased low These results are broadly consistent with the
clustering properties of galaxies in simulations reported
by Katz et al 1992 1999 once dierences in mass res-
olution box size and galaxy identication are taken into
account
Finally we make a distinction between two types of
galaxies those that are the sole resident of a dark matter
halo isolated galaxies and those which are members of
a larger halo containing several sub-halos see Tables 1 2
As expected the more massive galaxies reside in the more
massive parent halos which host more than one sub-halo
and so the isolated fraction decreases with mass Most
of the lower mass sub-halos are isolated As we shall see
below we expect the traditional interpretation of galaxy-
galaxy lensing to be more correct for the isolated galaxies
which in our case means those of low mass
5 GALAXY-GALAXY LENSING
The observational study of galaxy-galaxy lensing has a
long history Tyson et al 1984 although only recently
have denitive detections been made by several groups
Brainerd et al 1996 DellAntonio  Tyson 1996 Grif-
ths et al 1996 Hudson et al 1998 Natarajan et al 1998
Wilson et al 2000 Fischer et al 2000 Such studies have
traditionally been interpreted as constraints on extended
dark matter halos around typical galaxies see Fig 8
A more modern interpretation within the context of large-
scale structure is as a projection of the 3D galaxy-mass
correlation function Kaiser 1992 As with any such pro-
jection the eect of material along the line-of-sight but
not physically associated with the object in question can
be a serious one see eg Metzler White  Loken 2001
We shall not address this issue here focusing instead on
the underlying 3D correlation function itself and its inter-
pretation
Similar work on galaxy-galaxy lensing has already been
presented by Guzik  Seljak 2000 using semi-analytic
Fig 6 The 2-point correlation functions of the mass solid
lines galaxies with M500  1010h1M dashed and the galaxy-
mass cross correlation function dotted at z  1 2 and 3
Fig 7 The cross correlation coecient for the parameters in
Fig 6 The signal is noisy for high redshift and small distance due
to the nite number of galaxies and mass resolution limitations
in the simulation
models of galaxy formation By comparison with the semi-
analytic models our simulations have better spatial and
mass resolution and include far more physics Unfortu-
nately limitations on computer resources have forced us to
simulate a relatively small volume of space This both re-
duces the size of our samples for statistical purposes and
limits the minimum redshift to which we can accurately
follow the development of large-scale structure It is thus
encouraging that our results are in good agreement with
theirs in many respects
As a rst step we therefore ask how gmr relates to
the prole of an average galaxy in our simulation As
shown in Fig 8 the spherically averaged proles of our
halos are reasonably well t by the NFW prole Navarro
et al 1996

function for galaxies with M500  1010h1M gg

neighboring halos  as discussed in the text none of these galaxies
are isolated though all are centrally located in the parent halo

teristic radius rs The central density is xed by specify-
ing the halo mass While we have worked throughout in
terms of M500 the mass of the halo is typically dened to
be the virial mass M  43vircritr3
vir where we take
the virial radius rvir as the radius within which the mean
density enclosed is vir times the critical density Since our
cosmology has m 6 1 the top-hat model prediction for
vir is redshift dependent taking the value vir  100 at
z  0 vir  140 at z  05 and vir  182 as z  
The parameter c  rvirrs measures the degree of central
concentration of this mass
To estimate a prole from the cross correlation we dene
e r   1  gmr using a power-law extrapolation
to extend the range for both large and small radius be-
yond what we have computed explicitly from the simula-
tion The results are shown in Fig 9 along with two NFW
proles of virial mass M140  18  1011 h1M which is
the average mass of halos in the simulation at z  05
The concept of an average mass is somewhat nebu-
lous Simply averaging M500 for the halos identied at
z  05 gives hM500i  9  1010h1M Relating this to a
virial mass is complicated by the fact that the concentra-
tion c and thus the ration MvirM500 varies with mass
An alternative route is to use the Jenkins et al 2000 t
to the mass function to compute
eraging loses its signicance If it were possible to restrict
the galaxies going into the average then a more faithful
representation could be obtained although projection ef-
fects could still be a signicant source of error but we
have no a priori way of knowing the galaxy mass These
issues should be borne in mind when attempting to use a
weak lensing analysis to estimate halo proles or mass-to-
light ratios from galaxy-galaxy lensing
There are two eects which muddy the waters First
not all galaxies are the sole members of their dark matter
halos Even for those galaxies which are isolated what
one measures is the integral over the mass function of halo
proles Since more massive halos are in general larger
there is no sense in which one measures an average pro-
le For example Seljak 2000 has suggested that much
of the large-r signal in this case comes from the larger
halos rather than the asymptotic behavior of the smaller
hM i  R 
above Mcut  14  1010 h1M The limiting mass is ob-
tained by converting M500  1010 h1M to M140 for an
NFW prole with c  10
We nd that for z  05 the
virial mass and M200 dier by less than 10 so one could
alternatively use M200 throughout We employ this con-
version because the virial mass is closer to the mass def-
inition used by Jenkins et al 2000 than the M500 values
preferred in this study While several steps are involved
here White 2001 has shown that using an NFW prole
to convert between such mass denitions works very well
Varying the value of the concentration parameter in our
conversion from M500 to M140 makes little dierence to
our average mass For a concentration of 5 the mass ratio
is M140  16M500 and Mcut  2  1011 h1M
As we can see the NFW proles while providing a
good t to individual galaxies within the simulation
eg Fig 8 do not provide a very good t to the pro-
le e r Also using er we would estimate that
the virial mass of an average galaxy is M102  10 
1011 h1M M500  52  1010 h1M cf 9  1010
above a factor of two lower than the average computed
above Finally we note that the associated rotation curve
for our average galaxy is much atter than the rotation
curves for the individual galaxies making up the average
This is a consequence of the varying virial radii and the
weighting by the mass function and is not reecting the
distribution of matter in the individual halos
These results suggest that galaxy-galaxy lensing wherein
one increases the signal-to-noise by stacking many galax-
ies is not in fact measuring the prole of an average
galaxy in the usual sense of these words The main prob-
lem is that galaxies come in a wide range of masses and
sizes and live in a range of environments so the naive av-

at higher and lower redshifts is very similar to that shown here
In Fig 10 we show that although the isolated galax-
ies are the majority of the number counts Table 1 see
also White et al 2001 the signal for gmr is interme-
diate between that for isolated and non-isolated groups
The two curves begin to merge at very large radius where
the density is becoming close to the cosmic mean This
suggests that at larger radius r  1h1Mpc we are prob-
ing not the galactic mass prole but the general distribu-
tion of matter and the isolated and non-isolated galaxies
have similar large-r proles Furtherthe fact that gm dif-
fers from the isolated halo case at smaller r indicates that
even there one is not measuring the prole of the galactic
halo Galaxies which are part embedded in larger halos
contribute disproportionately to the signal from 10h1kpc
out to several 100h1kpc It is this intermediate range
of radii where the signal is dominated by larger halos as
Seljak 2000 suggests In either case when one measures
gmr one is not simply measuring the mass prole around
a galaxy located at the center of its dark matter halo
Guzik  Seljak 2000 have suggested that isolated
galaxies should show stronger cross-correlation at small-r
and xed mass since they are all centrally located within
their halos At xed galaxy ie sub-halo mass the oppo-
site eect is true since the non-isolated galaxies tend to
live in more massive halos However if we hold the mass of
the parent halo rather than that of the galaxy xed we can
correct for this eect We nd that if we do this then the
central galaxies are often in denser environments in the
sense that gm is larger at very small r  10 h1kpc How-
ever by r  100 h1kpc the opposite eect is true and the
non-isolated galaxies have the stronger cross correlation
This persists until r  1 h1Mpc where the cross correla-
tions for isolated and non-isolated galaxies are equal We
also note that the density around the peak is determined
primarily by the mass and formation time of the sub-halo
not on whether it is part of a larger structure Second
many of our systems contain distinct sub-halos in which
however the bridging material is at quite high density
indicating that it really is part of a larger structure and
not an artifact of our group nding technique In some
sense all of these sub-halos are central and have a simi-
lar mass prole even though they belong to a larger halo
This shows that the idealization of spherical parent ha-
los is a poor approximation to the groups we see in the
simulation
To understand the eect of the integration over mass we
show the signal broken up in dierent ways in Fig 10 In
the middle panel of Fig 10 we break things down by the
mass of the galaxy itself Since there is a trend for more
massive galaxies to be larger and to live in more massive
parent halos their cross-correlation is larger Again even
though the vast majority of galaxies by number have low
mass the signal comes from a range of masses We also
break the signal down by the galaxy stellar mass under
the assumption that the stellar mass is roughly tracing
the near infrared luminosity of a galaxy and the trends
are similar to the total mass case
Thus it appears that the oft-stated claim that galaxy-
galaxy lensing probes the prole of dark matter halos
around galaxies is not true in detail
6 STRONG LENSING AND EXTERNAL SHEAR
The angular structure in the gravitational eld near a
multiple-image gravitational lens arises from three compo-
nents the intrinsic structure of the primary lens galaxy
local tidal shears generated by other halos and structures
correlated with the primary lens and the accumulated
weak or large-scale structure LSS shear along the ray be-
tween the observer and the source In most circumstances
the LSS contribution can be modeled as an additional tidal
shear near the primary lens Kovner 1987 Barkana 1996
Simple models for the two sources of tidal perturbations
Kochanek  Apostolakis 1988 Keeton Kochanek  Sel-
jak 1997 suggest that the shear from correlated structures
is more important than the shear from LSS Keeton et
al 1997 also found that models for all four-image lenses
whose geometry makes the models very sensitive to the
angular structure of the gravitational eld show dramatic
improvements when the model has two axes for the angu-
lar structure of the gravitational eld These two axes pre-
sumably arise from the major axis of the primary lens and
the major axis of the combined tidal shear contributions
Kochanek 2001 has shown that one angular component
is clearly aligned with the primary lens galaxy while the
other has the amplitude expected from tidal perturbations
While standard weak lensing methods can be used to
calculate the statistical properties of the LSS shear con-
tribution they are not well suited to estimating the con-
tribution from structure correlated with the primary lens
If our simulation is correctly modeling the sites of galaxy
formation however it is ideal for exploring the correla-
tions between the shear generated by the density distri-
bution and estimates of the shear based on the virialized
halos which we can observe as galaxies Here we begin
this exploration by posing several questions focusing on
the properties of the correlated shear Answers to these
questions can be of practical use in understanding gravita-
tional lenses from observations and models First what is
the amplitude and distribution of the shear perturbations
generated by structure correlated with the primary lens
Second what is the physical scale on which the shear is
typically generated Third how does the total shear cor-
relate in direction and amplitude with the distribution of
galaxies
We begin by expanding the potential projected along
a randomly chosen line-of-sight in a Fourier series the
projection and Fourier expansion dont commute Of
particular interest is the shear or quadrupole moment of
the projected potential which we dene as the coecient
of the R2 term near the origin or
2  GZ d2R
R 
where R is the 2D projected distance We obtain the shear
by rewriting the potential in terms of the lensing potential
 which satises 2  2crit and then taking the
absolute value

crit 
For a source at z  1 and a lens at z  05 the comoving
critical density is 2  1015 h1Mh1Mpc2 Through-
out we shall quote crit2 which can be scaled to any given
lens redshift using Eq 6
In Eq 4 we need to dene the region of integration
We are not interested in the contribution to this shear
from the galaxy itself which is in any case dicult for us
to resolve Nor are we interested in the contribution from
uncorrelated large-scale structure along the line-of-sight
Thus we shall compute the shear within a shell extending
from rmin to rmax where r denotes a 3D distance For
rmax we choose roughly twice the correlation length of the
galaxy-mass cross correlation function or 2h1Mpc
fact the shear converges well within this radius and the re-
sults for rmax  1h1Mpc are almost identical Since the
integral converges rapidly the change of the chord length
at large-r doesnt aect our results For rmin we choose
two scales which bracket the reasonable range At the
low end we choose rmin  50h1kpc just outside the re-
gion of baryon domination At the high end we choose
rmin  200h1kpc roughly twice the virial radius The
amplitude of our results are quite sensitive to this choice
as the shear is dominated by nearby structures Finally we
also want to exclude matter and galaxies which would
in projection lie close to the Einstein radius of the galaxy
For this reason we exclude any matter or galaxies with
R  10h1kpc
Our particle-based estimator for  is thus
crit

where j and Rj are the projected coordinates of particle
j and the sum is over all particles in a shell centered on
the galaxy with rmin  rj  rmax and Rj  10h1kpc
The distribution in amplitude of the shear crit is
shown in Fig 11 For   102 the distribution is quite
well t by a power-law with the amplitude somewhat de-
pendent on the value of rmin we choose Towards lower
values of the shear we have a roll-o as required when the
Universe becomes optically thick Comparing the ampli-
tude of the shear generated with rmin  50h1kpc to that
with rmin  200h1kpc we see that much of the shear is
generated close to the lens The slope of the distribution is
close to the prediction of Keeton et al 1997 who mod-
elled the external shear as due to singular isothermal
spheres of xed radius for which   R1 distributed
according to a power-law correlation function r  r
with   74
In this model P   is just P  R
so dPd  4  94 shown as the dashed line in
Fig 11
Another interesting question is how the shear computed
using all of the mass compares to that obtained by using
only the galaxies We recomputed the shear above using
all galaxies in the annulus with M500  1010h1M We
nd that the direction is reasonably well reproduced with
the cosine of twice the misalignment angle
cos2 2

sharply peaked near 1 Fig 12 It is also of interest to
ask how our result is changed if we take only the nearest
galaxy Here we nd that while the shear is still strongly
peaked near cos2 2  1 it is less strongly peaked than if
we use all of the galaxies Fig 12 A much better indica-
tor is using the nearest massive galaxy ie galaxy above
1012h1M in which case the alignment is almost as good
as using all of the galaxies in the shell In comparing to
observations of course it is important to include the shear
coming from uncorrelated large-scale structure along the
line-of-sight which may cause a swing in the angle away
from the direction of the nearest galaxy
Finally scaling our results to the same mean mass den-
sity we nd that the amplitude ratio
mass
gal
has a large scatter with values covering several decades
This can be understood physically by recalling that the
galaxies roughly trace the position of mass concentrations
but the amount of mass in the galaxies can be only a small
fraction of the total mass in a given halo This fraction
typically decreases as the halo mass increases
7 CONCLUSIONS
We have presented predictions for the distribution of
mass around sites of galaxy formation using a hydrody-
namic simulation of structure formation which includes
cooling star-formation and feedback In such simulations
galaxies can be easily identied as dense knots of gas which
stand out strongly from the background Thus these sim-
ulations can be used to predict from rst principles the
galaxy auto-correlation function the galaxy-mass cross
correlation function which is the key ingredient in galaxy-
galaxy lensing studies and the mass auto-correlation func-
While the dark matter clustering agrees very well with
tting functions we nd that the evolution of the galaxy

bias is non-trivial and non-monotonic and that the bias is
increasingly stochastic to small scales The galaxy-mass
cross-correlation function is approximately the geometric
mean of the galaxy-galaxy and mass-mass auto-correlation
functions on scales above a few hundred kpc but there is
more structure below 100kpc
We nd that halos in our simulation have approximately
NFW forms with a large scatter about the mean prole
Relating the galaxy-mass cross-correlation to the prole
of an average halo is however fraught with diculties
Neither the mean mass the prole or the rotation curve
of a typical halo is well reproduced by interpreting gmr
as a galaxy prole This casts some doubt on the ability
of galaxy-galaxy lensing to determine the halo properties
or mass-to-light ratios of typical galaxies
Finally we have looked at the distribution of shear
around galaxies which could be strong gravitational lenses
We found that the cosmologically relevant distribution of
shears is well approximated by a power-law The slope of
this power-law is in good agreement with a model which
assumes all galaxies are singular isothermal spheres with a
power-law correlation function and that the shear is domi-
nated by the nearest neighbour The distribution rolls over
at   102 with a peak roughly an order of magnitude
below this The direction of the shear is well reproduced
by assuming the galaxies trace the mass or that the shear
is dominated by the nearest massive galaxy The distribu-
tion of the magnitude of the shear is however quite broad
