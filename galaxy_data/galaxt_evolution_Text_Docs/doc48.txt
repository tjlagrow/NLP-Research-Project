We analyse the kinematic and chemical evolution of 203 distant spheroidal elliptical and S0 galaxies at 02  z  08
which are located in different environments rich clusters
low-mass clusters and in the eld VLTFORS and
CAHAMOSCA spectra with intermediate-resolution have been acquired to measure the internal kinematics and stellar
populations of the galaxies From HSTACS and WFPC2 imaging surface brightness proles and structural parameters
were derived for half of the galaxy sample The scaling relations of the Faber-Jackson relation and Kormendy relation as
well as the Fundamental Plane indicate a moderate evolution for the whole galaxy population in each density regime In
all environments S0 galaxies show a faster evolution than elliptical galaxies For the cluster galaxies a slight radial depen-
dence of the evolution out to one virial radius is found Dividing the samples with respect to their mass a mass dependent
evolution with a stronger evolution of lower-mass galaxies M  2  1011M is detected Evidence for recent star
formation is provided by blue colours and weak O II emission or strong H absorption features in the spectra The results
are consistent with a down-sizing formation scenario which is independent from the environment of the galaxies
1 Introduction
Hierarchical structure formation models based on cold dark
matter particles predict different evolutionary paths and as-
sembly time-scales for the densest environments of clus-
ters of galaxies and the lowest densities of isolated galax-
ies Baugh et al 1998 Somerville  Primack 1999 From
typical age variations of 43 in the overall stellar content
between cluster and eld galaxies a late mass assembly
for massive spheroidal galaxies of smaller sub-units is ex-
pected However the involved physical processes star for-
mation rates gas cooling and heating remain poorly un-
derstood and thus the simplied baryonic recipes are inter-
preted and implemented differently In this paradigm eld
early-type galaxies are assembled through merging and ac-
cretion events of smaller clumps and fragments on longer
time-scales up to the recent past De Lucia et al 2004 The
environment is therefore suggested to play an important role
to shape the formation and evolution of early-type sphero-
idal galaxies and their internal properties
To shed more light on the formation and assembly his-
tory of spheroidal galaxies we have conducted an exten-
sive observational campaign using a combination of high
signal-to-noise SN  intermediate-resolution VLTFORS
and CAHAMOSCA spectroscopy together with HSTACS
plus WFPC2 imaging and deep ground-based multi-band
photometry Target galaxies are residing in environments
of various densities from massive rich galaxy clusters over

low-mass poor galaxy clusters to the isolated eld The
motivation of the project was to look how the physical prop-
erties of early-type galaxies as well as their sub-classes of
elliptical and S0 galaxies depend on their environment The
evolution of galaxies in luminosity size mass and their stel-
lar populations were intercompared to test possible envi-
ronmental effects and to constrain the theoretical formation
and evolution model predictions Throughout this work a
cosmology for a at low-density Universe is assumed with
m  03   07 and H0  70 km s1 Mpc1
2 Observational Data
Previous spectroscopic studies at moderate redshift were
limited to a small number of the more luminous galaxies
To overcome bias and selection problems of small samples
we focus in this work on a large number of 96 cluster mem-
bers in two massive rich galaxy clusters Abell 2218 Ziegler
et al 2001 and Abell 2390 Fritz et al 2005 and 68 cluster
members in six low-mass galaxy clusters at 02  z  03
Fritz et al 2004 Fritz et al 2010 in prep The low-mass
clusters were selected to have very low X-ray luminosities
LX  4  1043 ergs1 10 dex lower than X-ray bright
rich CNOC clusters and poor optical richness class Sphe-
roidal candidates in rich clusters were selected based on
deep U BI ground-based imaging using colour-colour cri-
teria that effectively removes fore- and background objects
Spheroidal candidates in poor clusters were selected by a
1 LX between 0124 keV

3 Results
31 Cluster spheroidal Galaxies
Scaling relations of the FaberJackson FJR and Kormendy
relation as well as the Fundamental Plane FP for distant
spheroidal galaxies at z  02 obey tight relationships sim-
ilar to the local Universe Assuming the local slope holds
valid with increasing redshift on average a modest lumi-
nosity evolution of the galaxies is derived regardless of
their environment With respect to the local Coma cluster
Jrgensen et al 1995 spheroidal galaxies in distant rich
clusters display on average a moderate brightening of 035
mag in the Gunn r-band For spheroidal galaxies in three
low-mass clusters a median evolution of Mr  038
mag is derived There is no signicant increase of distant
FJR scatter Compared to the local counterparts the dis-
tant FJR have shallower slopes at the 2 signicance level
which implies a mass-dependent luminosity evolution
Fig 1 shows the offsets of the FJR in Gunn r for the
spheroidal galaxies in two rich upper panel and three low-
mass clusters lower panel from the local FJR of the Coma
sample as a function of clustercentric radius and mass Clus-
ter spheroidals show a slight radial dependence Galaxies in
the outer regions at 025 virial radii 046 Mpc show a
stronger brightening by 02 mag than their central coun-
terparts This radial trend with a stronger evolution for gal-
axies residing in the outskirts of a cluster is also found in
poor clusters see Fig 1 Lower-mass galaxies in all cluster
environments are on average brighter by  06 mag in rest-
frame Gunn r than locally whereas the distant spheroidals
with masses of M  3  1011 M display only a mild
evolution with respect to their present-day counterparts
Lenticular S0 galaxies in rich clusters exhibit a stron-
ger evolution compared to the local Coma FP than the Es
The stellar populations of these systems could be more di-
verse or comprise more complex star formation histories
SFH Fritz et al 2005 This gets support by the rest-frame
galaxy colors Bluer galaxies B  I  229 show larger
FJR residuals from the local FJR of Mr  050 mag
whereas redder galaxies are less offset Mr  014 mag
In both color ranges S0 galaxies indicate a stronger evolu-
tion brighter by 07 mag for the bluer and 045 mag for
the redder but blue Es have on average only a mild bright-
ening of 03 mag than the local reference
32 Field spheroidal galaxies
The mass-to-light ML ratio of the eld spheroidals evo-
lves on average as  lnMLB  171018 z which
is faster than for cluster spheroidal galaxies This is consis-
tent with eld spheroidals comprising on average younger
stellar populations than those of their cluster counterparts

Field spheroidal candidates were selected based upon
the deep U BgRI and BRI multi-band sky surveys of the
FORS Deep Field FDF Heidt et al 2003 and William
Herschel Deep Field WHDF Metcalfe et al 2001 respec-
tively For the follow-up VLTFORS spectroscopy the main
selection criterium was an apparent brightness of R  220
mag This ensured a SN 15 A1
rest in the absorption lines
mandatory for a robust measurement of internal kinemat-
ics and line-strengths The nal sample comprises 24 eld
spheroidals down to MB  1930 cf Fritz et al 2009
HSTWFPC2 and ACS structural parameters for 78 sph-
eroidal galaxies were derived with two different algorithms
which analyse each galaxy surface brightness prole with
seeing-convolved sky-corrected r14 and exponential com-
ponents both simultaneously and separately Elliptical E
and S0 galaxies were morphologically classied using a vi-
sual inspection the prole tting results and their bulge-to-
total fractions A weak correlation of the bulge fraction of
cluster galaxies with visual morphological Hubble type was
found Velocity dispersions  based on hSN i30 A1

Field Spheroidal Galaxies Left Evolution of the mass-to-light ML ratios Less-massive galaxies M 
21011M indicate a faster evolution Right Evolution of the quenching mass There is a weak increase of the quenching
mass with increasing redshift in good agreement with model predictions that suggest star formation triggering through
AGN feedback Fritz et al 2009
The evolution as derived from the scaling relations of
the FJR FP and hence effective ML ratio shows a strong
dependence on the mass Less-massive systems M  2 
1011M display a faster ML evolution  lnMLB 
125030 z whereas more-massive galaxies M  2
1011M evolve slower  lnMLB  089  019 z
This implies that for the most massive eld galaxies the
majority of their stellar populations was formed early at
zform  35  13 For less-massive galaxies the ML evo-
lution can be translated into zform  19  05 which is at
variance with the predictions of single-burst stellar popula-
tion models A fraction of 510 in the total stellar mass
of lower-mass galaxies M  21011M must have been
formed at more recent epochs At z  04 an accelerated
evolution for less-massive galaxies M  2  1011M
h lnMLBi  054  007 than for more-massive
ones h lnMLBi  031  006 is signicant on the
2 level Fritz et al 2009
Field S0 galaxies feature a stronger luminosity evolution
h lnMLBi  024  010 bluer rest-frame colours
and more diverse stellar populations and hence evolve faster
than eld Es h lnMLBi  009  007 Interest-
ingly the scatter appears to be mainly amplied for S0s
Evidence for secondary star formation SF activity in
the galaxies is provided by O II 3727 emission or strong
H Balmer absorption as well as bluer rest-frame B  I
colour diagnostics The H absorption line strengths imply
that the residual low level SF of the galaxies accounts for
5 to 10 in the total stellar mass budget of these systems
Over the past 6 Gyr there is the trend of a slow de-
creasing quenching mass see Fig 2 which characterises
a crossover in stellar mass above SF in galaxies gets sup-
pressed This suggests that our systems experience a grad-
ual suppression in their SF processes Our results favour a
scenario where SF is not immediately suppressed for less-
massive halos and hence works on longer time scales in
lower-mass galaxies For details see Fritz et al 2009
33 Conclusions
The lack of an age difference found for eld and cluster gal-
axies and the dependence of the evolution on galaxy mass
suggests that environmental effects are not the dominant
factors which drive the formation of early-type galaxies In-
ternal properties such as mass size  or chemical composi-
tion are the main contributors to their evolutionary history
The evolution in the ML ratio in all environments favors a
down-sizing formation scenario Cowie et al 1996
A mass-dependent luminosity evolution is found in all
environments Fritz et al 2005 2009 E and S0 galaxies are
not a homogeneous group but follow different evolutionary
tracks S0s indicate in all environments a stronger evolution
and more recent formation epochs 1  zform  2 Thus
S0s may have different stellar populations or more com-
plex extended SFH whereas Es evolve passively on longer
timescales yielding to older population ages zform  3
