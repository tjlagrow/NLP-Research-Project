Abstract Supermassive black holes appear to be generic components
of galactic nuclei Following their formation in the early universe black
holes should often nd themselves in bound pairs as a consequence of
galaxy mergers The greatest uncertainty in estimating the coalescence
time of black hole binaries is the degree to which a binary wanders about
the center of the galactic potential A simple model for binary decay is
presented which qualitatively reproduces the evolution observed in the
N -body simulations The model predicts binary coalescence times that
are never less than several billion years Mass ejection by a decaying black
hole binary should substantially lower the density of its host nucleus The
weak density cusps of bright ellipticals may be explained in this way if it
is assumed that these galaxies formed from nearly gas-free mergers
Introduction
The case for supermassive black holes BHs in galactic nuclei is now very strong
and in a few galaxies almost irrefutable The evidence is most compelling in
galaxies where the kinematics of stars or gas can be traced into sub-parsec scales
examples are the Milky Way Genzel et al 1997 Ghez et al 1998 where stellar
proper motions can be measured at distances of  002 pc and NGC 4258
Miyoshi et al 1995 where the rotation curve of H2O maser sources obeys
Keplers law into  013 pc For a larger sample of galaxies kinematical data
extending into  10 or  100 pc provide suggestive though not yet irrefutable
evidence of supermassive compact objects Kormendy  Richstone 1995
Although the masses of the detected BHs comprise on average only  03
of the mass of their host spheroids Ho 1998 there is a growing body of work
suggesting that the dynamical inuence of a supermassive BH can extend far
beyond the nucleus Furthermore the formation and growth of BHs may be
intimately connected with the evolution of galaxies on larger scales For instance
mergers between galaxies containing nuclear BHs would produce supermassive
BH binaries which would eventually coalesce via the emission of gravitational
radiation Begelman Blandford  Rees 1980 The formation and decay of
these binaries may be relevant to a wide range of phenomena from the wiggling
of radio jets Kaastra  Roos 1992 to the destruction of stellar density cusps
Ebisuzaki et al 1991
This review discusses the time scale for coalescence of supermassive BH
binaries 2 and the dynamical eect of the BHs on stellar nuclei 3 and the
large-scale structure of galaxies 4
2 Supermassive Black Hole Binaries
Supermassive BHs appear to be ubiquitous components of galactic nuclei Since
galaxies often merge one would expect to form BH binaries at a rate that is
roughly equal to the galaxy merger rate The formation and coalescence of a
BH binary is believed to take place via three fairly distinct stages Begelman
Blandford  Rees 1980
1 Two parent galaxies interact the BHs  surrounded by their dense star
clusters  sink to the center of the common potential well via dynamical friction
forming a binary
2 The BH binary shrinks by ejecting stars from the nucleus via three-body
interactions
3 When the binary separation has fallen to the value at which gravitational
radiation becomes ecient the BHs coalesce
In the absence of gas the rates of the rst two processes are in principle possible
to calculate via N -body simulations However the problem is a dicult one to
simulate due to the wide range of length and time scales none of the published
simulations have succeeded in following the decay to the point where gravita-
tional radiation would become important Here we derive a simple analytical
model for the decay of BH binaries which reproduces the results of the N -body
simulations then use it to estimate the coalescence time

If the binary remained xed at the center of a spherical potential it would
quickly eject all stars on orbits with pericenters less than  a The local density
would fall to zero and the binary would cease to harden We assume instead
that mass removal produces a constant-density core of stars out to some radius

We may compare the predictions of this simple model to the results of
N -body simulations of BH binary decay Quinlan  Hernquist 1997 QH
followed the evolution of a BH binary in a galaxy with an initial   r2 density
cusp Expressed in their units the scaling parameters in eq 7 are ah  1200
t0  110 and th  8 Fig 1 is a plot of eq 7 scaled to these units The
predicted time dependence at is qualitatively very similar to that found by
QH their Fig 2 However those authors found that the rate of binary decay
depended systematically on the number N of particles used to represent the
galaxy larger values for N gave slower evolution For N  6250 the smallest
number considered by them Fig 1 overestimates the evolution rate by a factor
of only  2 remarkably close given the approximations made For N  25104
and 105 the adjustment factors are  3 and  5 respectively
QH attributed the N -dependence of the hardening rate to wandering of
the binary about the center of the galaxy potential
In a core of density 
an rms velocity vb of the binarys center of mass will produce a wandering
with amplitude rw  vbG12
If the source of the binarys motion were
elastic encounters with stars of mass m equipartition arguments would give
vb  mM1212  104 However the binary converts some of its binding
energy into bulk motion when it ejects stars with momenta  maha12
This super-elastic scattering allows the binary to sample the stellar density
over a much wider range of radii than if it remained stationary QH in fact
veried that xing the binary to the center of the potential caused the hardening
to cease after the binary had ejected most of the stars within r  ah
If the background density within the wandering radius rw were to fall the
gravitational restoring force acting on the binary would also drop and the wan-
dering amplitude would increase roughly in proportion to 12 This feedback
mechanism should tend to inhibit the formation of a central hole in the stellar
density Mikkola  Valtonen 1992 The crude model derived above mimics this
process by forcing the background density to remain constant for r  rc the
model could be improved by incorporating the wandering radius explicitly
In the N -body simulations the perturbations that the binary experiences
from the stars become less noisy as N is increased implying a reduced wander-
ing radius and a lower hardening rate Makino 1997 found that the wandering
amplitude varied roughly as N 12 for N  3  105 However QH found that
the hardening rate did not change appreciably when N was increased from 105
to 2  105 They argued that rw might reach a limiting amplitude for large
N due to the feedback mechanism discussed above This hypothesis is impor-
tant to check however doing so will require simulations with very large particle
numbers
The binary will rapidly coalesce when the time scale for emission of gravi-
tational radiation

We can use the analytic expressions derived here to extend the N -body
simulations until a time corresponding to coalescence the correction factor of 5
mentioned above is applied to aah in order to reproduce the hardening rate

While eq 14 is an accurate extrapolation of the evolution seen in the N -body
experiments it should probably be interpreted as a lower limit to the coalescence
time expected in a real spherical galaxy due to the likely overestimate of the
wandering radius in the simulations However the dependence of t1 on m2 and
 is probably more robust Since for real galaxies L  4 and M12  L eq 14

this relation is consistent with three galaxies whose BH masses are well-determined
M84 Bower et al 1998 M87 Macchetto et al 1997 and NGC 4258 Miyoshi
et al 1995 Fig 2a suggests a typical coalescence time of several billion years
Very low mass binaries would evolve more rapidly eq 14 but another
factor would delay their coalescence the necessity of the two BHs nding their
way to the potential center following a galaxy merger Governato et al 1994
carried out merger simulations of galaxies containing BHs they concluded that
inspiral times could be very long if the infalling galaxy had a suciently low
mean density to be tidally disrupted A more likely scenario is that the infalling
BH retains some of the mass of its host galaxy We can estimate the inspiral time
by assuming that the smaller galaxy is tidally limited by the larger galaxy as its
orbit decays Following Merritt 1984 the tidal radius is located at the point
where the eective potential gravitational plus centrifugal has a saddle point
Approximating both galaxies as singular isothermal spheres and assuming that
the smaller galaxy of mass mg is on a circular orbit of radius r its tidal radius
and mass become

tively Chandrasekhars formula then gives for the orbital decay rate and infall

where eq 15 has been used to relate g to m2 This relation is plotted in Fig
2b and the total time ttot  t1  t2 in Fig 2c Remarkably Fig 2c suggests
that real BHs have roughly the mass that would be required to minimize their
total coalescence time Nevertheless this time appears to be very long
Other mechanisms might accelerate the coalescence If the potential of the
stellar nucleus is non-axisymmetric orbits will not conserve angular momentum
and stars with a much wider range of energies may interact with the binary
However it is not clear whether self-consistent triaxiality can be maintained in
a nucleus where the potential is dominated by a BH Sridhar  Touma 1999
Merritt  Valluri 1999 Gas if present would also exert a drag force on the
binary Loss-cone relling by two-body interactions between stars Frank 
Rees 1976 is almost certainly unimportant due to the long relaxation times in
nuclei Valtonen 1996
If coalescence times are comparable to the mean time between galaxy merg-
ers a third BH would often be introduced into a nucleus containing an uncoa-
lesced pair The most likely outcome is ejection of two BHs in opposite directions
with the third remaining at the center Valtonen 1996 This process could sub-
stantially reduce the mean ratio of BH mass to galaxy mass over time
3 Formation and Destruction of Nuclei
Combining eqs 4 and 12 the total mass ejected by the BH binary between th
and tgr is  4M12 The structure of the pre-existing nucleus should therefore be
disturbed out to a radius where the enclosed stellar mass was a few times M12
A reasonable guess for the initial density prole is   r   2 as assumed
in the model above adiabatic growth of a BH in a nucleus with a shallower
prole generically leads to a power-law cusp with index near 2 Quinlan et al
1995 Merritt  Quinlan 1998 and this is also the slope observed in the faintest
ellipticals Kormendy et al 1995 which are the least likely to have experienced
the sort of core disruption discussed above

found this to be a good description of what happens in N -body simulations of
a single BH spiralling into a pre-existing core
In the case of a decaying BH
binary stars on eccentric orbits are most likely to interact with the binary and
be removed leaving behind a nucleus in which the stellar motions are strongly

solid line is a nonparametric regression t to Mv
biased toward circular The resulting density prole is dicult to calculate The
N -body simulations discussed above Makino 1997 QH yield central proles
that are crudely describable as power laws with indices 0    1 however
these results are probably dependent on the degree of BH wandering and hence
Which galaxies in the current universe would be expected to contain these
low-density cores Kaumann  Haehnelt 1999 present a semi-analytic model
for the formation of galaxies in a cold-dark-matter universe they assume that
supermassive BHs form from gas that is driven into the centers of galaxies during
mergers The predicted ratio of gas mass to stellar mass during the last major
merger is a steep function of galaxy luminosity in their model this ratio drops
from  3 for Mv  18 to  03 for Mv  21 albeit with considerable scatter
their Fig 14 Gas-rich mergers would be expected to form dense nuclei while
gas-free mergers should produce low-density cores after the BHs coalesce Figure
3 shows that the variation of  with galaxy luminosity is roughly consistent with
Kaumann  Haehnelts model Faint ellipticals Mv  19 have   2 while
for brighter galaxies  decreases with increasing luminosity This trend is often
described as a dichotomy although the data of Fig 3 suggest a continuous
distribution as expected in a model like Kaumann  Haehnelts
4 Large-Scale Evolution
The gravitational inuence of a supermassive BH can extend far beyond the
nucleus in a galaxy that is not axisymmetric Gerhard  Binney 1985 The
mechanism is dynamical chaos induced in the stellar orbits by close passages
to the BH Merritt  Valluri 1996 Although relatively little N -body work
has been done on this problem one study Merritt  Quinlan 1998 found that
nuclear point masses can cause initially triaxial galaxies to evolve to globally
axisymmetric shapes in little more than a crossing time when the ratio of BH
mass to galaxy mass exceeds  2 This mass ratio is consistent with the value
that induces a transition to global stochasticity and rapid mixing in the phase
space of box-like orbits Valluri  Merritt 1998
Mergers of stellar disks produce generically triaxial objects Barnes 1996
adding a dissipative component to the simulations produces end states that are
much more nearly axisymmetric Barnes  Hernquist 1996 The evolution in
shape occurs rapidly once a few percent of the total mass has accumulated in the
center Barnes 1999 The stars in these simulations respond to the gas only
insofar as the latter aects the potential thus the change in shape is a purely
stellar-dynamical phenomenon and we would expect to see similar evolution
even in gas-free mergers if the BHs are suciently massive
The typical ratio of BH mass to galaxy mass is  0003 Ho 1998 somewhat
less than the value required to induce a rapid transition to axisymmetry For
MMgal  0003 Merritt  Quinlan 1998 found a time scale of  102 crossing
times for the evolution to axisymmetry This exceeds a Hubble time for galaxies
with luminosities above Mv  19 Valluri  Merritt 1998 hence we might
expect bright ellipticals to often retain their merger-induced triaxial shapes In
fact there is evidence for a systematic change in the shape of ellipticals at about
this magnitude Tremblay  Merritt 1996 bright ellipticals as a class show
evidence for triaxiality while the axis-ratio distribution of faint ellipticals is
consistent with axisymmetry
The same orbital evolution that destroys triaxiality also tends to produce a
smoother phase-space density One consequence is that boxiness in the isoden-
sity contours  a natural consequence of a non-smooth phase space distribution
Binney  Petrou 1985  should be destroyed along with triaxiality This too
has been observed in simulations of gaseous mergers the eect is sometimes
attributed to dissipation eg Bekki  Shioya 1997 but it is again almost
certainly a purely stellar dynamical eect A prediction is that triaxiality should
correlate with boxiness since a central mass concentration or BH should tend
to destroy both following a merger Evidence for such a correlation has been
noted by Kormendy  Bender 1996
