ABSTRACT
We present an analysis of the Fundamental Plane for a sample of 27 eld early-type galaxies in the redshift
range 06  z  115 in the Chandra Deep Field-South and the eld of the background cluster RDCS 12529-
2927 Sixteen of the galaxies are at z  095 The galaxies in this sample have high signal-to-noise spectra
obtained at the Very Large Telescope and high resolution imaging from the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys
From comparison with lower redshift data we nd that the mean evolution of the mass-to-light ratio ML of our
sample is ln MLB  - 175  016z with a large galaxy-to-galaxy scatter This value can be too low by 03
due to selection effects resulting in ln MLB  - 143  016z The strong correlation between ML and rest-
frame color indicates that the observed scatter is not due to measurement errors but due to intrinsic differences
between the stellar populations of the galaxies such that our results can be used as a calibration for converting
luminosities of high redshift galaxies into masses This pace of evolution is much faster than the evolution of
cluster galaxies However we nd that the measured ML evolution strongly depends on galaxy mass For
galaxies with masses M  2  1011M we nd no signicant difference between the evolution of eld and cluster
galaxies ln MLB  - 120  017z for eld galaxies and ln MLB  - 112  006z for cluster galaxies
The relation between the measured ML evolution and mass is partially due to selection effects as the galaxies are
selected by luminosity not mass However even when taking selection effects into account we still nd a relation
between ML evolution and mass which is most likely caused by a lower mean age and a larger intrinsic scatter
for low mass galaxies Results from lensing early-type galaxies which are mass-selected show a very similar
trend with mass This combined with our ndings provides evidence for down-sizing ie for the proposition
that low mass galaxies are younger than high mass galaxies Previous studies of the rate of evolution of eld
early-type galaxies found a large range of mutually exclusive values We show that these differences are largely
caused by the differences between tting methods most literature studies are consistent with our result and with
one another when using the same method Finally ve of the early-type galaxies in our sample have AGN There
is tentative evidence that the stellar populations in these galaxies are younger than those of galaxies without AGN

1 INTRODUCTION
Understanding the formation and evolution of early-type
galaxies is a key issue when addressing the mass assembly and
star formation history of the galaxy population as a whole and
the formation of structure in the universe as 50 or more of all
stars in the present day universe are in early-type galaxies and
bulges see eg Bell et al 2003
In hierarchical galaxy formation theories eg Cole et al
2000 massive galaxies assemble late such that strong evolu-
tion of the mass density from z  1 to the present day is expected
see eg Kauffmann  Charlot 1998 Measuring the mass
density requires a measurement of the luminosity density and
an accurate determination of the ML ML can be estimated
from models see eg Bell et al 2004 but these estimates
are uncertain due to the agemetallicity degeneracy and the un-
known IMF of the stellar populations of the galaxies Bruzual
 Charlot 2003
The Fundamental Plane Djorgovski  Davis 1987 Dressler
et al 1987 provides a tool to measure the evolution of ML
without model uncertainties The ML offset of high redshift
galaxies from the local FP can be used to calibrate high red-
shift galaxy masses and to estimate the age of their stellar pop-
ulations Franx 1993 This technique has been used success-
fully to measure the luminosity weighted ages of massive clus-
ter galaxies which have formed most of their stars at redshifts
z  2 see eg van Dokkum  Franx 1996 van Dokkum 
Stanford 2003 Holden et al 2005 However it is not clear
whether galaxies in the general eld evolve in the same way In
fact in the hierarchical picture the formation redshift of galax-
ies with a given mass depends on environment Diaferio et al
2001 This would lead to substantial age differences between
eld and cluster galaxies at any redshift van Dokkum et al
2001 Since this is a generic property of all hierarchical for-
mation models measuring this difference is a critical test for
those theories
Various authors have measured the ML evolution of eld
early- type galaxies through deep spectroscopy of magnitude
limited samples The results are much less conclusive than the
results from cluster studies and the comparison between eld
and cluster has proved to be very hard Some authors claim
much faster evolution for eld galaxies than for cluster galax-

Dokkum et al 2001 van Dokkum  Ellis 2003 van der Wel
et al 2005 Studies involving lensing galaxies Kochanek et
al 2000 Rusin et al 2003 van de Ven et al 2003 indicate
the presence of a mix of fast and slowly evolving galaxies It
is unclear whether the differences between the various results
are caused by selection effects measurement errors due to low
signal-to-noise spectra low number statistics or contamination
by late-type galaxies
This paper describes a study of early-type galaxies at z  1
using much higher quality data than in previous studies The
substantially large number of objects with very high signal-to-
noise spectra enables us to accurately measure the ML evo-
lution of the eld early-type galaxy population to compare
the cluster and eld populations to study correlations between
ML M and rest-frame color and to describe the possible ef-
fects of biases Also we carefully compare the samples and
results from previous studies and this study in order to verify
previous claims about the evolution of eld galaxies and to see
whether previous results are in fact consistent with each other
and these new results
In Section 2 we describe the sample selection the spectro-
scopic observations and data reduction and the measurement
of velocity dispersions Section 3 describes the measurement of
the structural parameters colors morphologies and the avail-
able X-ray data In Section 4 we present the results Throughout
this paper we use Vega magnitudes and assume M  
0307 with a Hubble constant of H0  70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1
2 SPECTROSCOPY
21 Sample selection and Observations
We selected galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field-South
CDFS and the RDCS12529-2927 cluster eld CL1252
Rosati et al 2004 which both have deep optical imaging from
the Advanced Camera for Surveys ACS on the HST GOODS7
provides publicly available imaging in four lters Giavalisco
et al 2004 F475W F606W F775W and F850LP hereafter
b v i and z As these data were not yet available when we
started this project we used ground-based COMBO-17 pho-
tometry Wolf et al 2004 to select our sample for the rst
observing run For subsequent runs version 05 of the ACS
GOODS data were available and for the last run we used the
version 10 data release Blakeslee et al 2003 provide ACS
imaging on the CL1252 eld in the i and z bands
In order to construct a sample of early-type galaxies at z  1
in the CDFS we selected objects with i- z  086 and COMBO-
17 photometric redshifts in the range 08  zphot  14 We use
z when we mean redshift and zmag if we mean z-band magni-
tude but when indicating a color we omit the mag subscript
for clearity This color cut selects galaxies redder than a local
Sbc galaxy at z  1 Therefore this study only includes galax-
ies that are on the red sequence at z  1 We morphologically
classied all galaxies satisfying these criteria and brighter than
zmag  215 distinguishing between early- and late-type galax-
ies using the ACS imaging The classication was based on
compactness regularity and the presence of spiral arms 26 out
of the 52 galaxies satisfying our selection criteria we classied
as early-type galaxies We designed multi-slit masks for three
different pointings selected by the number of primary targets
that could be included Open spaces in the masks were lled
7 httpwwwstsciedusciencegoods
with early-type galaxies satisfying the color and redshift crite-
ria but fainter than zmag  215 early-type galaxies with lower
photometric redshifts and late-type galaxies with i - z  085
and redshifts 08  zphot  14 Switching from using ground-
based i - z colors from COMBO-17 to ACS i - z colors from
GOODS did not lead to large differences between the selected
samples although several objects changed priority
The same selection criteria were used for the CL1252 eld
However the mask design for the CL1252 eld was geomet-
rically constrained because the primary targets were cluster
galaxies at z  124 The two brightest galaxies in the clus-
ter are the two central galaxies which had to be included in
a single slit because of their small angular separation of 15
Therefore not only the positions but also the position angles of
the designed masks were xed Unfortunately only two galax-
ies brighter than zmag  215 redder than i - z  085 and early-
type morphologies could be included additionally to the cluster
galaxies Similarly to the CDFS masks llers were included
We carried out the observations with FORS2 in MXU mode
on ESOs Kueyen one of the VLT unit telescopes We
used the 600z grism together with the OG590 order sepa-
ration lter to obtain a sufciently high spectral resolution
  80 km s- 1 and to cover the wavelength range around the
Balmer4000 break for galaxies at z  1 The observations
were carried out in series of four dithered exposures with spa-
tial offsets of 15 or 2 and equal exposure times ranging from
14 to 30 minutes each
In total 51 hours of scientically useful integration time was
acquired of which 38 hours had seeing better than 1 The cu-
mulative integration time for the three pointings in the CDFS is
27 hours with a median seeing of 095 The single pointing
in the CL1252 eld has an integration time of 24 hours with
a median seeing of 065 These observations were carried out
during ve different observing runs from September 2002 to
November 2003
The sample described in this paper consists of 38 galaxies
with velocity dispersions of which 20 are early-type galaxies
at z  1  and 18 are early-type galaxies at lower redshift or
late-type galaxies 100 of our primary targets yielded velocity
dispersions The CL1252 observations also yielded four veloc-
ity dispersions of cluster galaxies The FP of the 1252 cluster
is discussed by Holden et al 2005
22 Data Reduction
The spectroscopic data were reduced using standard IRAF
tasks Lamp at elds were taken before or after each night
in sequences of ve exposures We used the sequence clos-
est in time to the science observation Cosmic rays were re-
moved using the LACosmic task van Dokkum 2001 Af-
terward all frames were checked manually We subtracted a
two-dimensional sky spectrum from each exposure obtained
by median averaging the four dithered exposures in a sequence
masking the target and secondary or serendipitous objects if
present The atmospheric emission lines which are bright and
abundant in the observed wavelength range were used to per-
form the wavelength calibration We corrected for distortion in
the spatial direction by tracing the target All individual expo-
sures were optimally weighted to obtain maximum SN
There are various atmospheric absorption features in the ob-
served wavelength range Because the strength and shape of
these features change with airmass and atmospheric conditions
van der Wel et al
FIG 1 Rest-frame spectra in 8 bins of the galaxies in our sample with early-type morphologies used in the analysis in the subsequent
sections The area around 7600 observed wavelength and the positions of bright skylines are excluded from the binning The wavelength range
differs from object to object due to differences in redshift and slit position Every spectrum is labeled with the redshifts and an e if the spectrum
shows one or more emission lines

FIG 2 Rest-frame spectra in 8 bins of the galaxies in our sample with late-type and irregular morphologies These are not included in the
analysis in the subsequent sections For further explanation of the spectra see Figure 1
we needed to correct each exposure separately To this end we
included a blue star in each of our masks which was reduced
along with the galaxy spectra After the nal combination the
regions in the galaxy spectra with atmospheric features were
divided by the normalized spectrum of the blue star Spectro-
scopic standard stars were used to do a relative ux calibra-
tion One-dimensional spectra were extracted by adding those
pixel rows with more than 25 of the ux of the brightest row
weighting optimally
The smoothed one-dimensional spectra are shown in Figure
2 The coordinates of the objects for which we measured veloc-
ity dispersions see Section 23 in Table 1 Redshifts SN and
emission lines are given in Table 2
23 Velocity Dispersions
Velocity dispersions are obtained by tting template spectra
to the observed galaxy spectra The tting method is exten-
sively described by van Dokkum  Franx 1996 The con-
tinua of both the observed and the template spectra are ltered
out in Fourier space and the template spectrum is convolved
with a Gaussian to match the width of the absorption lines in
the galaxy spectrum The part of the galaxy spectrum used in
the t is as large as possible Therefore our measurements do
not rely on a few high SN absorption features
As templates we use Coud spectra of 132 stars with the
appropriate wavelength range from the sample constructed by
Valdes et al 2004 with a spectral range from F0 to M6 in-
cluding both very low and high metallicity stars and different
luminosity classes These spectra have a FWHM resolution of
about 1 Each stellar spectrum needs to be smoothed to each
galaxy spectrum separately before being re-binned A second
order function is tted to the width of atmospheric emission
lines as a function of wavelength to obtain the spectral resolu-
tion to which the template spectra are smoothed
When tting the galaxy spectra we weight with the inverse
of the sky brightness and we mask the region around the atmo-
spheric A band at 7600 The spectrum above 9300 is omit-
ted because of the strong atmospheric absorption the ever in-
creasing brightness of the sky emission lines and the decreasing
system throughput
After performing the t for a small number of templates
masking and weighting as described we check the residuals
from the t Regions with emission lines large sky line residu-
als and remaining data artifacts such as cosmic ray remnants are
masked if present We then apply t the galaxy spectrum with
all template spectra We check whether the obtained parame-
ters change strongly if one or two strong features are masked
out but we conclude that this generally is not the case exclud-
ing the strongest features from the t increases the 2-value
but does not change the results signicantly in most cases For
some spectra however including Balmer lines in the t leads
to different results probably because unseen emission line con-
tributions contaminate these features For low quality spectra
van der Wel et al
SN  10 per 16 pixel in the extracted one-dimensional spec-
tra the contributions of Balmer lines or other strong features
can hardly be checked because excluding these strong features
leaves insufcient signal to obtain a proper t Therefore we
exclude objects with SN  12 spectra from our analysis but
we mention the effect of including these
For all spectra with SN  12 the random errors are below
3 for   200 km s- 1 and below 5 for   200 km s- 1
Adding a systematic uncertainty including template mismatch
and the error on the resolution of the galaxy spectra of about
10 for SN  10 spectra and 2 for the highest SN spectra
the total errors range from 3 to 17 with a median of 75 for
our sample of early-type galaxies with SN  12 Some galax-
ies have measured velocity dispersions that are not much larger
than the resolution of the spectra Although these are included
in the analysis they play no important role in the derivation of
our results
The best tting stellar spectral type and the measured veloc-
ity dispersion are listed in Table 1 These velocity dispersions
are aperture corrected to a 34 diameter circular aperture at the
distance of Coma as described by Jrgenson Franx  Kjr-
gaard 1995 This correction ranges from 5 to 7
3 PHOTOMETRY
31 Prole Fitting and Morphologies
The ACS provides us with an unprecedented combination
of deep and high resolution imaging The spatial resolution
FWHM at z  1 is 08kpc allowing us to accurately mea-
sure the effective radii of early-type galaxies at this redshift
which typically are a few kpc We use the single unstacked
at-elded frames publicly available through the HST MAST
archive For the CDFS the number of frames for different posi-
tions ranges from 8 to 24 with 530s exposure time each For
the CL1252 eld the number of frames ranges from 10 to 40
with 1200s exposure time each but is mostly 10 as only the
center of the cluster has 40 overlapping images
For each galaxy each individual z band image is tted by
r1n-models with n  1234 convolved by a position depen-
dent PSF created with TinyTim Krist 1995 measuring re f f
the effective radius e f f the surface brightness at re f f  the
position angle and the ellipticity Each individually derived set
of model parameters is distortion corrected by calculating the
pixel scales in the x- and y-directions using the polynomial
distortion coefcients available through the WWW8 We then
average the results and compute the measurement error from
the scatter The error is generally about 6 in re f f  but the
combination of the uncertainty in re f f and e f f is such that it
is directed almost parallel to the local FP The error relevant to
the offset from the FP is typically 2 Thus uncertainties in
the offset from the local FP are dominated by the uncertainty
in  of which the error is pointed almost perpendicular to the
FP The effective radii and surface brightnesses are given in Ta-
ble 1 For consistency with earlier studies these are the values
obtained from tting a de Vaucouleur prole in our analysis
To transform the observed z band surface brightnesses to
the rest-frame B band we use the technique described by van
Dokkum  Franx 1996 using the templates from Coleman
Wu  Weedman 1980 and observed colors see Section 32 to
interpolate between the pass-bands The calculated rest-frame
8 httpwwwstscieduhstacsanalysisPAMS

B band surface brightnesses only depend very weakly on the
spectral type of the template used The typical difference found
for using the Sbc template instead of the E template is less than
002 mag The transformations are a function of redshift As an
example we give the transformation based on the E template
for a galaxy at z  1
Physical sizes and rest-frame B-band surface brightnesses are

Figures 3 and 4 show the combined residuals of the r14-ts
along with the color images of the 38 galaxies with velocity
dispersions Figure 3 shows the early-type galaxies Figure
4 the late-type galaxies Two numbers are used to character-
ize the magnitude of the residuals At the upper right of each
residual image the absolute value of the ux in the asymmet-
ric part of the residual is given as a percentage of the total ux
of the galaxy obtained by subtracting the residual rotated by
180 degrees from the residual itself In the upper left the ab-
solute value of the ux in the symmetric part of the residual is
given as a percentage of the total ux of the galaxy We nd
that the asymmetric residual is a good indicator of morphol-
ogy Our nal morphological qualication is a combination of
the magnitude of the asymmetric residual and visual inspection
of the cause of the asymmetry Some of the early-type galax-
ies Figure 3 have signicant asymmetric residuals but these
are caused by features on a very small scale in the centers of
the galaxies ie not by features attributed to spiral arms or
other large scale irregularities The late-type galaxies Figure
4 have large asymmetric residuals caused by large scale struc-
tures like spiral arms We note that the Sercic number does
not distinguish well between late- and early-type galaxies For
example the most massive galaxy in our sample has n2 and
some galaxies that we classify as late-type galaxies have n4

We supplement the ACS imaging with ground-based optical
and near-IR imaging from FORS2 and ISAAC on the VLT and
SOFI on the NTT Vandame et al in preparation GOODS
ACS imaging of the CDFS provides photometry in the b v
i and z bands data release version 10 and ESOs imaging
survey9 provides SOFI and ISAAC imaging in the J and K
bands Since the CDFS is not entirely covered by ISAAC we
use the SOFI data for the objects outside the ISAAC pointings
All images were smoothed to match the resolution of the K
band data with the worst seeing which is 08 for the ISAAC
imaging and 1 for the SOFI imaging The photometric differ-
ences between the ISAAC and SOFI datasets are small  001
mag since the zero-points of the ISAAC data are based on
SOFI photometry For the CL1252 eld we use optical imag-
ing from ACS i and z and FORS2 B V  and R and near-IR
imaging from ISAAC Lidman et al 2004 Again all images
were smoothed to match the ground-based data with the worst
seeing which is 06 in the B band
We measure the ux in each band for each of our spec-
troscopic targets within several apertures with different radii
123re f f and 08 Contaminating objects within the aper-
ture are masked We choose to use the uxes measured within
a radius of 2re f f  with a minimum of 08 trading off between
the measurement accuracy and the amount of contamination
The FP at z1 for Field Galaxies
The i - z and J - K colors are given in Table 2 as well as total
AUTO z band and K band magnitudes as obtained with SEx-
tractor Bertin  Arnouts 1996
The availability of near-IR photometry not only allows us to
compute rest-frame U - B colors but also rest-frame B -
ors To transform the observed colors to rest-frame U - B and
I we use the same method as used to calculate rest-frame B
band surface brightnesses see Section 32 For z  1 using the
E template the transformation is
effective radii separately for each band we compute the sur-
face brightness in the r band at the effective radius as measured
in the g band We note that the FP coefcients as derived by
Bernardi et al are different from those from Jrgensen et al
but this does not lead to different results
In Figure 5 we show the FP of the SDSS galaxies and our
sample where the surface brightnesses of all galaxies are trans-
formed to the value they would have at z  1 assuming luminos-
ity evolution found for massive cluster galaxies ln MLB

galaxies is derived from compiling all existing data in the lit-

Stanford 2003 Wuyts et al 2004 Holden et al 2005 Our
eld sample shown in Figure 5 includes all early-type galaxies
with spectra with SN  12 This is also the sample used in
the analysis throughout the rest of the paper and in the subse-
quent gures As can be seen the FP already existed at z  1
for a large range in size At low masses outliers occur but the
interpretation is not straightforward as selection effects play a
major role in this regime see Section 43

ies compared to the eld early-type galaxy sample from SDSS small

is corrected for evolution to a value it would have at z  1 assum-

galaxies The FP already existed at z  1 for a large range in size

The offset of high redshift galaxies from the local FP is inter-
preted as a difference in ML as compared to equally massive
local galaxies see eg vam Dokkum  Franx 1996 Figure 6

33 X-ray Data
For both the CDFS and the CL1252 eld deep X-ray data
from Chandra are available such that we can check for the pres-
ence of AGN in our galaxy sample Giacconi et al 2002 and
Alexander et al
2003 provide catalogs of the CDFS data
The Chandra data of the CL1252 eld is described by Rosati
et al 2004 who also constructed a point source catalog Eight
galaxies in our sample of 38 are identied as AGN based on
their large X-ray luminosities typically  1042erg s- 1 Five
of these are early- type galaxies of which two have emission
lines in their spectra Besides the eight AGN two galaxies in
our sample are identied as extended X-ray sources This X-
ray radiation is accounted for by diffuse halo gas The X-ray
luminosities of CDFS-4 and CDFS-22 are 715  1041 erg s- 1
and 342  1042 erg s- 1 respectively It is not surprising that
CDFS-4 and CDFS-22 turn out to be two of the most massive
galaxies in our sample Also CDFS-22 is one of the galaxies
with an AGN The X-ray properties of our sample of galaxies
are given in Table 2

Jrgensen Franx  Kjrgaard 1996 have shown that the

where Re f f is the effective radius in kpc  the central velocity

logIe f f B  - 04Bz and  the intercept The values of the co-
efcients are derived from the early-type galaxies in ten nearby

From the sample of Faber et al 1989 we derived that the inter-
cept of the FP lies lower by 004 in the projection given above
The offsets of the high-z galaxies are computed using a local
FP with coefcients from Jrgensen et al 1996 but with the
intercept derived from the Faber et al 1989 sample
Besides the form of the local FP we need a large sample of
local eld early-type galaxies for example to address issues
such as selection effects We construct our local eld sample as
in Bernardi et al 2003 we take early-type galaxies from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey and include those with less than 10
neighbors brighter than Mi  - 2055 and closer than 14Mpc
We convert the rest-frame g and r band surface brightnesses to
a B band surface brightness using the conversion given by Jr-
gensen et al 1996 As we need the surface brightness in the
g and r bands at the same radius and Bernardi et al derive

a function of redshift The values are listed in Table 3 Clus-
ter samples from the literature are also shown The galaxies in
our sample seem to evolve faster than the galaxies in the cluster
samples and the scatter in ln MLB is large Before we in-
terpret the scatter and the apparent difference between eld and
cluster galaxies we need to investigate the origin of the scatter
In Figure 7 we show MLB as a function of the rest-frame B -
color Galaxies with low ML are bluer than galaxies with high
ML as expected from the stellar population models shown in
the gure In Figure 8 we show a similar relation between rest-
frame U - B and MLB but in this case the correlation is less
clear due to the fact that the range of U - B colors is much
smaller than the range of B -
I colors and probably also be-
cause U - B is more sensitive to small variations in the star for-
mation history Considering the correlation between color and
ML and the fact that ML evolves with redshift one expects
that color evolves with redshift as well In Figure 9 we show
I as a function of redshift note the strong similarities be-
tween Figures 6 and 9 The strong correlation between color
and ML and the similarity in ML evolution and color evolu-
tion conrm that the observed evolution and scatter of ML are
intrinsic and not due to measurement errors
We calculate the evolution of ML of our eld sample by per-
forming a linear t and minimizing the mean deviation weight-
ing by the inverse of the error and forcing the t to go through
the z  002 data point derived from the Faber et al
sample We separately consider the evolution of the primary
sample which contains the galaxies satisfying all of our se-
lection criteria We nd that the average evolution of our en-
tire early-type galaxy sample is ln MLB  - 175  016z
- 172  015z for the primary sample alone which is sig-
nicantly faster than the evolution found for cluster galaxies
which is ln MLB  - 128  008z van Dokkum  Franx
1996 Kelson et al 2000 van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 Wuyts
et al 2004 Holden et al 2005 The scatter in ln MLB is
058 for our eld galaxy sample 054 for the primary sample
and 028 for the MS1054 cluster sample Wuyts et al 2004
Figure 5 suggests that the ML evolution may depend on
galaxy mass as galaxies with small re f f and low  tend to
lie lower with respect to the local FP as compared to galax-
ies with large re f f and high  This was also found for cluster
galaxies by Wuyts et al 2004 We estimate M and ML in
solar units as described by van Dokkum  Stanford 2003
The values are listed in Table 3 We explore the mass depen-
dence by color coding the galaxies in Figure 6 according to
their masses Red points are galaxies with masses larger than
M  2  1011M blue points are galaxies that have masses
lower than M  2  1011M There is a striking difference be-
tween low and high mass galaxies For galaxies with masses
M  2  1011M we measure ln MLB  - 120  018z
for our eld sample and - 112  006z for the cluster sam-
ples For the massive galaxies in the primary sample alone
we nd ln MLB  - 126  018z The observed scatter
is decreased to 034 for the eld sample 032 for the primary
sample and to 028 for the cluster samples When chang-
ing this mass cut to 3  1011M as is done by Wuyts et al
2004 but thereby limiting the number of galaxies in our sam-
ple to four we nd - 112  013z and - 099  010z for
our sample and the cluster samples respectively We con-
clude that for high-mass galaxies there is no difference be-
tween the cluster samples and our eld sample The galax-
ies with masses M  2  1011M in our sample evolve much
faster ln MLB  - 197  016z - 190  017z for the
primary sample alone We verify that these results do not
change if galaxies with spectra with SN  12 are included as
well Therefore the accuracy of our results is not limited by the
quality of the velocity dispersions
In Figures 6 and 9 we show evolutionary tracks for a sin-
gle stellar population for formation redshifts z  1 and 2 This
very simple model assumes that luminosity evolves with time
as L  t -
t f orm where  is derived from stellar population
models see van Dokkum et al 1998 for more details These
tracks indicate a large spread in formation redshifts We note
however that  is sensitive to the IMF Here we use a sin-
gle stellar population from Bruzual  Charlot 2003 with a
Salpeter IMF and solar metallicity which yields   097 in the
B band and 043 in the I band According to this model the
massive galaxies have high luminosity weighted formation red-
shifts z  2 whereas less massive galaxies in our sample have
lower formation redshifts 1  z  2
The FP at z1 for Field Galaxies
FIG 6 The offset from the local FP in the rest-frame B band for
individual cluster galaxies taken from the literature small dots and
the early-type galaxies with high SN spectra in our sample We dis-
tinguish as in Figure 5 between the primary sample lled symbols
and the llers crosses The red symbols are galaxies with masses
M  2  1011M The blue symbols are less massive galaxies The
cluster samples are taken from Jrgensen et al 1996 Kelson et al
2000 van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Wuyts et al 2004 Holden
et al 2004 and van Dokkum  Stanford 2003 The solid line is
 lnMLB  112z which is the best tting straight line for the evo-
lution of cluster galaxies with masses M  2  1011M The dotted
lines are model tracks for a single stellar population with formation
redshifts 1 lower line and 2 upper line see text for a more de-
tailed explanation These model tracks are forced to go through the
black point at z  002 which represents the eld galaxies in the sam-
ple of Faber et al 1989 The range in offsets from the local eld
FP is large but there is a strong correlation with mass Massive eld
galaxies evolve as fast as equally massive cluster galaxies while less
massive galaxies evolve faster
43 The relation between M and ML and the role of
selection effects
Figure 10 illustrates the tight relation between mass and
MLB We also show the SDSS eld sample described in Sec-
tion 41 The ML of all galaxies have been corrected for evo-
lution as derived from massive cluster galaxies ln MLB 
- 112z
At z  1 the relation between ML and M seems much
steeper than in the local universe However we have to take
selection effects into account Since we selected our sample
in the z band we can transform our magnitude limit into a lu-
minosity limit in the rest-frame B band which is close to the
observed z band at z  1 the median redshift of our sample of
16 z  1 galaxies is z  104 Because this luminosity limit
only applies to our primary sample this discussion does not in-
volve the llers mainly galaxies at z  07 Afterward we will
comment on these galaxies
FIG 7 Rest-frame B -
I color versus MLB for our early-type
galaxy sample For an explanation of the symbols see Figure 6a The
large symbol at the upper right indicates the median B- I and MLB of
the massive galaxies M  2  1011M in the SDSS eld early- type
galaxy sample The orientation of the distribution around the median
values and the amount of scatter are indicated by the tilted error bars
The dotted line is a solar metallicity Bruzual-Charlot model for a sin-
gle stellar population The solid line is a model with exponentially
declining star formation   1 Gyr Both model tracks are shifted
vertically to match the SDSS data point Model ages are indicated by
ticks at intervals of 1 Gyr The correlation between ML and color
implies that the observed scatter in ML is real and can be ascribed
to age differences between the stellar populations of the galaxies Our
i- z  086 color selection limit roughly corresponts to B-
I  11 ac-
cording to the Bruzual-Charlot models This shows that our selection
criterion only excludes galaxies with ages less than 1 Gyr and does
not affect our conclusions regarding the massive red galaxies
We rst test whether the observed distribution can be fully
explained by selection effects assuming that the slope and the
scatter of the FP do not evolve The probability that the ob-
served distribution is drawn from a population with the same
distribution as the SDSS galaxies is 014 if the ML evolu-
tion is the same for all galaxies Therefore the slope evolves
the scatter evolves or both If there is an age difference between
high and low mass galaxies the scatter will most probably also
evolve differently for high and low mass galaxies We cannot
exclude with high condence that the observed distribution of
ML is due to a larger scatter at high redshift if the scatter in
ML at z  1 is twice as large as in the local universe the proba-
bility of a non-evolving slope is 80 However we see no evi-
dence for an increase in the scatter at the high mass end where
selection effects do not play a role Hence if the scatter evolves
this is only true for galaxies with masses M  1011M Since
the increased scatter is most likely caused by young ages low
mass galaxies would have lower ML and hence the slope of
the relation would also be changed We consider these ndings
as strong evidence for mass-dependent evolution of early-type
galaxies To conrm that we observed a change in the slope of
the FP deeper and larger surveys are needed
van der Wel et al
Besides a bias due to the luminosity limit errors in the veloc-
ity dispersion produce correlated errors in M and ML hence
underestimating the measured evolution Taking the errors in
 into account we nd that this introduces a bias at the level
of only 2-3 which is several times smaller than our measure-
ment accuracy
FIG 8 Rest-frame U - B color versus MLB for the early-type
galaxy sample For an explanation of the symbols see Figure 6a The
Local data point is taken from Gebhardt et al 2003 There is a
similar relation as in Figure 7 but it is less clear because the range
of colors in much smaller in U - B than in B -
I Our i - z  086
color criterion corresponds to U - B  007 at z  1 which demon-
strates that this criterion would only exclude the most extremely blue
galaxies with ages well below 1 Gyr
The location of the luminosity limit at z  1 in Figure 10
shows that our z  1 sample is dominated by selection effects
for masses M  6  1010M The objects which such low
masses are only included in the sample because of their proba-
bly extreme ML We cannot correct the ML of that subsample
for the bias introduced by our luminosity limit
On the other hand for the sample of galaxies with higher
masses we can correct for selection effects because they are
relevant but not dominant as can be seen in Figure 10 The
average evolution of the galaxies in the primary sample with
masses M  6  1010M is ln MLB  - 155  016z The
median mass of this subsample of 12 galaxies is M  19 
1011M We estimate the maximum bias by assuming that the
slope is the same at z  1 and in the local universe but that the
scatter is a factor two larger at z  1 than at z  0 In that case
the observed distribution is expected to follow the short-dashed
line in Figure 10 At a given mass the difference between the
solid line and the short-dashed line is the bias introduced by
the selection effects in luminosity We increase the observed
ML of each galaxy in our primary sample by the difference
between the solid line and the short-dashed line at the mass of
that galaxy For galaxies more massive than M  2  1011M
this correction is negligible but for the galaxies with masses
M  6  1010M this correction is about 30 Using this
method we nd a bias corrected evolution of the galaxies with
masses M  6  1010M of ln MLB  - 143  016z
Given the uncertainty in the intrinsic scatter deeper observa-
tions are necessary to conrm this value
FIG 9 The evolution of the rest-frame B- I color with redshift For
an explanation of the symbols see Figure 6a As already suggested
by the tight relation between B -
I and ML in Figure 7 the evolution
of color with redshift is very similar to the evolution of ML with red-
shift Massive galaxies are the reddest in the local universe and their
color evolves slower than the color of low mass galaxies Also the
color of the most massive eld galaxies is very similar to the color of
massive cluster galaxies
The above analysis only involves z  1 galaxies satisfying
all our selection criteria but we note that the relation between
ML and M exists for the z  07 galaxies as well However
this subsample is selected in an inhomogeneous way therefore
it is impossible to correct the observed evolution Since all the
galaxies roughly lie along lines of constant luminosity the bias
toward low ML galaxies likely explains the observed relation
between M and ML for this sub-sample
Besides by luminosity and morphology the galaxies in our
sample are also selected by color This potentially introduces
an important bias in the measured evolution because of the ex-
clusion of galaxies with blue colors ie low ML Our color
criterion however is quite generous Even the very blue low
mass galaxies satisfy this criterion For typical Bruzual-Charlot
models our color limit i- z  086 corresponds to U - V  067
at z  1 which is 02 mag bluer than the limit applied by Bell
et al 2004b to select galaxies on the red sequence at z  1
Our color cut is 045 mag bluer than the color-magnitude rela-
tion found by the same authors From Bruzual-Charlot models
we estimate that we only miss galaxies that are younger than
 1 Gyr see Figures 7 and 8 Furthermore Bell et al 2004b
did not nd blue massive galaxies in the entire COMBO-17
dataset Hence it is very unlikely that we miss any blue galaxy
The FP at z1 for Field Galaxies
at the bright end of our sample because of our color selection
criterion
as ln MLB  - 113  031z The galaxies less massive
than this evolve much faster - 171  030z The similarity
between the results from the lensing sample and our sample
is striking especially because the lensing sample is mass se-
lected Hence it is very hard to see how a bias toward low ML
galaxies can be responsible for the observed mass dependence
in the lensing sample It is possible that not all the low mass
lenses are genuine early-types If we omit the most irregular
lenses FBQ09512635 SBS1520530 and B1608656 we
still nd rapid evolution - 164  024z for low mass lensing
galaxies Hence these results provide strong evidence that the
observed dependence of ML evolution on mass in our sam-
ple is real One possible complicating factor is that the lensing
cross-section of galaxies in groups is larger than that of galax-
ies in the lowest density environments This may lead to a dif-
ference between the populations of the lensing sample are our
sample
FIG 10 M versus MLB as derived from the FP for the early-type
galaxies in our sample and for the nearby sample from the SDSS For
an explanation of the symbols see Figure 6a All data points have
been corrected for ML evolution as found for massive cluster galax-
ies  lnMLB  - 112z normalizing at z  1 The dotted line indi-
cates our magnitude limit translated into a luminosity limit at z  1
Therefore this limit only applies to the lled circles The full drawn
line indicates the median MLB of the SDSS early-type galaxies pop-
ulation The long-dashed line indicates the median MLB of galaxies
that are brighter than our luminosity limit at z  1 Assuming that the
scatter in ML at z  1 is a factor 2 larger than in the local universe
the median of the ML of galaxies brighter than the luminosity limit
follows the short-dashed line It is clear that for the three galaxies
in the primary sample with the lowest masses selection effects play
such a dominant role that we cannot include these objects in our ef-
forts to correct for this bias Between 6  1010M and 2  1011M
selection effects are relevant but not dominant For higher masses
selection effects do not affect our sample The difference between
galaxies with masses of  1011M and masses  1012M cannot be
explained without an increase in the scatter with redshift or assuming
mass-dependent ages
44 Independent evidence for mass-dependent evolution of
early-type galaxies
It is particularly interesting to compare our results to the re-
sults from studies involving lensing galaxies since those sam-
ples are mass selected Rusin et al 2003 and van de Ven et al
2003 nd ln MLB  - 129  009z and - 143  030z
respectively using the same dataset This seems somewhat low
compared to the evolution of our sample and results found in the
literature but the lensing galaxies typically have high masses
see Table 4 The data for individual galaxies published by
van de Ven et al show that the median mass of the lens sam-
ple is M  2  1011M whereas the median mass of our early-
type galaxy sample is M  13  1011M The galaxies in the
lens sample that are more massive than M  2  1011M evolve
FIG 11 Asymmetric residuals of the r14-prole ts see Figures
3 and 4 versus the offset from the local FP of the early-type galaxies
in our sample corrected for evolution Filled circles are galaxies best
t with r14-proles asterisks with r13 and open circles with r12
Encircled objects are galaxies with late-type morphologies A 2 or
more residual indicates a signicant deviation from symmetry in the
light prole There is no clear relation between ML and deviations
from smooth surface brightness proles
45 Ongoing star formation and morphological deviations
It is interesting to see that galaxies with emission lines have
relatively low ML as can be seen from both Figure 6 and 10
Treu et al 2002 have already shown that a substantial frac-
tion of the massive early-type galaxy population at high red-
shift shows evidence for ongoing star formation by the pres-
ence of emission lines Galaxies with emission lines in our
sample however tend to have low masses Figure 10 suggests
that several of the galaxies with masses  3  1010M are in-
cluded in the magnitude limited sample only because they are
van der Wel et al
forming stars When excluding galaxies with emission lines
the evolution of the sample without applying a mass cut is
ln MLB  - 161  018z The galaxies with emission
lines evolve faster ln MLB  - 241  045z On aver-
age the mass of the galaxies without emission lines is 15 times
larger than the mass of the galaxies with emission lines
Mergers or interactions accompanied with star formation
can lead to both deviations from smooth r1n-proles and low
ML values van Dokkum  Ellis 2003 have shown tenta-
tive examples of this phenomenon Figure 11 shows the magni-
tude of the asymmetric residual described in Section 31 ver-
sus the offset from the FP corrected for luminosity evolution
There is no correlation between deviations from smooth surface
proles and ML and we nd no evidence for a connection be-
tween star formation activity and interactions or mergers
46 AGN
Four out of 11 early-type galaxies at z  08 have AGN and
one out of 16 for the z  09 sample as determined from X-
ray imaging see section 33 Of the ve early-type galax-
ies with AGN three are more massive than M  2  1011M
and two have emission lines in their spectra The ML evo-
lution of galaxies in our sample with AGN is ln MLB 
- 164  031z which is not very different from the value for
galaxies without AGN - 176  020z However the galaxies
with AGN are twice as massive than the galaxies without AGN
Considering high mass galaxies only M  2  1011M we
nd - 146  024z for galaxies with AGN and - 102  041z
for galaxies without AGN Now the trend is reversed but only
one out of the ve galaxies with an AGN has a particularly blue
I color for its ML Therefore a larger sample is needed to
conrm that the epochs of star formation and AGN activity are
related Woo et al 2004 nd that up to z  05 the evolution
of the FP for galaxies selected to have AGN is indistinguishable
from otherwise selected galaxies Our results provide tentative
evidence that a difference may set in at higher redshift
5 COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS RESULTS
Various other authors have measured the ML evolution of
eld early-type galaxies In this section we compare these pre-
vious results with our ndings and we comment on the appar-
ent inconsistencies that exist in the literature In Table 4 we
give the ML evolution as reported by other papers as well as
the values we derive using the tabulated datasets given in those
papers
Treu et al 2002 nd ln MLB  - 166  031z This
number is corrected for selection effects while the value in Ta-
ble 4 is uncorrected to make a fair comparison with other re-
sults The median mass of the sample presented by Treu et
al 2003 is 25  1011M for a sample extending to z  06
Tabulated data are only available for the lower redshift galaxies
presented in Treu et al 2001 Only the galaxies with very low
redshifts z  01 have low masses therefore the comparison
between high and low mass galaxies cannot be made We note
that the evolution of the entire Treu et al sample is consistent
with the evolution of our entire sample - 175  016z and
that the evolution of the massive galaxies in our sample is only
mildly inconsistent with the evolution of the Treu et al sample
Several of the high mass galaxies in the Treu et al sample have
emission lines in their spectra which contrasts with our sample
Van Dokkum et al 2001 nd - 135 035z for an average
redshift z  042 The galaxy masses range from 3  1010M
to 1012M and are evenly distributed in log M Remark-
ably when taking the tabulated data of the individual galax-
ies and applying our tting method we nd a larger value
- 167  023z see Table 4 Van Dokkum et al create red-
shift bins in which they calculate the bi-weight center of the
ML offset This method is sensitive to the bin choice which
leads to the difference between the reported value and the value
calculated with our tting method We note that when using
our tting method the result of van Dokkum et al
is very
similar to the result presented in this paper Splitting the van
Dokkum et al
sample into low and high mass galaxies at
M  2  1011M we nd - 129  039z for the high mass
galaxies and - 194  034z for the low mass galaxies We
veried that this 25 difference can be explained entirely by
the fact that the galaxies are luminosity selected not mass se-
lected Contrary to this study and the work of Treu et al van
Dokkum et al did not select the galaxies by color but by mor-
phology and magnitude only
Van Dokkum  Ellis 2003 nd - 125  025z The differ-
ence in tting method mentioned above applies to this study
as well Additionally their transformation from I-band surface
brightness to rest-frame B-band surface brightness using V -
colors is uncertain Namely using V -
I is an extrapolation
for galaxies at z  08 This leads to a different value for the
ML evolution if we use our method to t to the individual
galaxy data of the samples of van Dokkum et al 2001 and van
Dokkum  Ellis 2003 - 169  013z a value very similar
to the result yielded by our sample Using the bi-weight center
to measure the evolution effectively gives very low weighting
factors to outliers If the two galaxies with the lowest ML in
the high-z sample of van Dokkum et al are omitted we nd
- 153  013z The measurement accuracy together with the
uncertain transformation to rest-frame properties can explain
the remaining difference The new sample described by van
Dokkum  Ellis 2003 is too small to verify whether there is a
trend with galaxy mass There is one galaxy more massive than
M  2  1011M with ln MLB  - 157  014z As is the
case for the sample of van Dokkum et al 2001 the sample
of van Dokkum  Ellis 2003 is not selected by color This
did not lead to faster evolution due to including blue early-type
galaxies which indicates that the color cuts in the other studies
are adequately generous to avoid this bias
Gebhardt et al 2003 hereafter G03 report a brightening
in the rest-frame B band of early-type galaxies by 24 magni-
tudes at z  1 which is derived from tting a cubic spline to
the offsets of the galaxies from the local FP With our tting
method we nd - 194  020z using the data of the individ-
ual galaxies in that sample This is consistent with the result
presented in this paper The difference between the value re-
ported by G03 and our result using their data is caused by the
three galaxies at redshifts z  09 Our linear t to their data and
their t agree well up to z  08 16 magnitudes brightening
If we split the G03 sample into high and low mass galaxies
we nd an evolution of - 159  050z for galaxies more mas-
sive than M  2  1011M and - 205  017z for less massive
galaxies For low mass galaxies our result - 197  016z and
that of G03 agree well The fast evolution for massive galaxies
in their sample remains unexplained but given the large uncer-
tainty and the small number of objects the inconsistency is only
mild We note however that contrary to the early-type galax-
ies in our sample the early-type galaxies in the G03 sample
do not show a correlation between ML and rest-frame U - B
The FP at z1 for Field Galaxies
color One of the galaxies in the G03 sample serves as an ex-
ample of the uncertainty HST141765226 has been observed
spectroscopically before Ohyama et al 2002 and happens to
be in the sample of lensing galaxies of Rusin et al 2003 and
van de Ven 2003 G03 give a stellar velocity dispersion of
  222  8km s- 1 corrected to the same aperture as our dis-
persions Ohyama et al have measured   245  15km s- 1
also corrected to the same aperture which implies a somewhat
smaller offset from the local FP van de Ven et al report a value
of   292  29km s- 1 as derived from the lensing model The
latter value leads to a rate of evolution that we nd for the mas-
sive galaxies in our sample Repeated observation of these mas-
sive galaxies may be illuminating
We conclude that all the results found in the literature are mu-
tually consistent once differences in calculating and presenting
the results have been taken into account
6 CONCLUSIONS
We obtained ultra-deep spectroscopy for 27 eld early-type
galaxies with redshifts 06  z  115 The offset of these high
redshift galaxies from the local FP is used as a measure of the
evolution of ML and as an age estimator
The average evolution of the early type galaxies in our sam-
ple is ln MLB  - 175  016z The value we nd for
galaxies in the primary sample those galaxies satisfying all our
selection criteria is the same The scatter in ln MLB is
large 058 This shows that some galaxies must have high
luminosity weighted formation redshifts z  2 while others
have formed a large fraction of their stars at redshifts 1  z  2
Emission lines in the spectra indicate that some galaxies show
signs of ongoing star formation at the epoch of observation
This is in agreement with the presence of massive early-type
galaxies with emission lines at z  05 Treu et al 2002 al-
though the galaxies with emission lines in our sample tend to
have low masses
We nd a tight correlation between ML and rest-frame
color which shows that the variation in ML among the galax-
ies in the sample is intrinsic and due to differences in the stellar
populations The galaxies in our sample span a large range of
masses We nd that low mass galaxies have larger offsets from
the local FP than high mass galaxies Because luminosity se-
lected samples are biased toward galaxies with low ML this
is a trend that is expected We carefully analyze whether the
observed correlation between mass and ML can entirely be
explained by this selection effect or not We nd that galaxies
with masses M  6  1010M are only included in our sample
because they have low ML For galaxies at z  1 with masses
larger than M  6  1010M our sample is biased but to a lim-
ited amount Taking into account the selection effect we ex-
clude with high condence that the distribution of mass and
ML of our z  1 galaxy sample with masses M  6  1010M
has the same distribution as the low redshift eld early-type
galaxy sample taken from Bernardi et al 2003 corrected for
evolution We do not claim that we have observed a change
of the slope of the FP because we cannot exclude the possi-
bility that our sample is drawn from a distribution that has the
same slope as the Bernardi et al sample but with a scatter
that is twice as large at z  1 However the outliers do not oc-
cur at the high mass end M  1012M of our galaxy sam-
ple but at lower masses namely M  1011M Therefore
our results show that the evolution of early-type galaxies is
mass-dependent whether by an increase in the scatter at lower
masses or by systematic faster evolution of lower mass galax-
ies as compared to higher mass galaxies or which is the most
natural explanation by a combination of these effects Assum-
ing the scatter has decreased from z  1 to the present day by
a factor of 2 we nd that the for bias corrected ML evolution
of z  1 early-type galaxies with masses M  6  1010M is
ln MLB  - 143  016z
Previous studies Treu et al 2001 2002 van Dokkum et
al 2001 van Dokkum  Ellis 2003 Gebhardt et al 2003
that claimed to have derived mutually exclusive results are in
fact consistent with our results if the same tting method is
applied to the different datasets Particularly interesting is the
consistency of our results with the results from a sample of lens-
ing galaxies Rusin et al 2003 van de Ven 2003 which also
shows the mass-dependence even though this sample is not bi-
ased toward galaxies with low ML because of the selection
technique the lens sample contains galaxies with typical ML
at a given mass Our luminosity limited sample is sensitive to
outliers which are present indeed The combination of these in-
dependent results strengthens the evidence for mass-dependent
evolution and the combined increase in both slope and scatter
with redshift
Bell et al 2004 claim that the mass density of red sequence
galaxies increases by at least a factor of 2 from z  1 to the
present This is partly based on the observation that the lumi-
nosity density is constant out to z  1 The ML evolution of
our galaxy sample implies an increase by a factor of 4 in the
mass density In the local universe most of the mass density in
early-type galaxies is accounted for by galaxies with a velocity
dispersion of  225km s- 1 Kochanek et al 2000 or a mass
of  3  1011M If those galaxies which evolve somewhat
slower dominate the evolution of the mass density the increase
is slightly less 3 - 35
The correlation between mass and ML has been observed
in clusters as well Wuyts et al
2004 but this can en-
tirely be explained by selection effects Both our eld sam-
ple and the cluster samples found in the literature are not
strongly biased for galaxy masses M  2  1011M When
applying this mass cut the evolution for cluster galaxies is
ln MLB  - 112 006z and the evolution for eld galax-
ies is ln MLB  - 120  018z - 126z for galaxies in the
primary sample Galaxies with masses comparable to the mass
of L galaxies in the local universe  3  1011M have lumi-
nosity weighted ages that imply formation redshifts z  2 in-
dependent of environment If progenitor bias is important the
luminosity weighted age of typical early-type galaxies in the
local universe can be considerably lower
In hierarchical formation models the predicted difference
between the ML of eld and cluster galaxies is ln MLB 
055 independent of redshift van Dokkum et al 2001 This
large difference is related to the difculty of constructing iso-
lated galaxies without active star formation ie
to the lack
of a mechanism that truncates star formation from within the
galaxy Our results rule out this prediction at the 996 con-
dence level up to z  11
Our ndings are consistent with down-sizing Cowie et al
1996 Kodama 2004 This idea is independently corroborated
by other observations such as the decrease of the mass of EA
galaxies with time Tran et al 2003 the lack of star formation
in massive galaxies at redshifts z  1 De Lucia et al 2004
the fossil record of star formation in local early-type galaxies
Thomas et al 2004 and the claim of mass-dependent evolu-
van der Wel et al
tion of spiral galaxies Ziegler et al 2002 Bhm et al 2004
The lack of age differences between eld and cluster galax-
ies and the suggested mass-dependent evolution of early-type
galaxies show that individual properties of a galaxy and not
environment play an important role in its formation
We have shown that rest-frame optical colors can be used
to measure galaxy masses at high redshift This can be re-
garded as a step toward accurately calibrating SED tting as
a mass estimator Certainly including Spitzer photometry in
the rest-frame near-infrared will provide tight correlations be-
tween dynamically derived ML and ML derived from SED
tting Line-strengths of absorption features in our high SN
spectra will connect low redshift fossil record studies to evo-
lutionary studies such as these and constrain the metallicity
range of early-type galaxies at z  1 lifting the age-metallicity
degeneracy Using the mass calibration for high-redshift galax-
ies the evolution of the mass density and the mass function can
be determined from volume limited samples This will provide
strong constraints on formation theories and the importance of
progenitor bias

Note  Column 2 lists the values of the evolution of ML as reported in the cited papers Column 3 lists the values we derive using our
tting technique on the tabulated data of the individual galaxies in the cited papers Column 4 lists the evolution of galaxies more massive than
M  2  1011M using our tting technique and column 5 lists the evolution of less massive galaxies Average masses redshifts and sample sizes
N of the samples are also listed When two references are given the results presented in the newest paper are based on data of both papers Treu
et al 2002 only list redshifts and velocity dispersions of the galaxies The reported values are all uncorrected for selection effects Treu et al
2002 only give an error for the uncorrected value and Gebhardt et al 2003 do not give an error Besides the magnitude limited samples the two
studies of the same sample of lensing galaxies are also listed We only tted the tabulated data from van de Ven et al 2003 but the data presented
by Rusin et al 2003 yield the same results
