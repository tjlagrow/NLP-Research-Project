Abstract Gigahertz Peaked Spectrum GPS radio galaxies are generally thought to be the young counter-
parts of classical extended radio sources and live in massive ellipticals GPS sources are vital for studying
the early evolution of radio-loud AGN the trigger of their nuclear activity and the importance of feedback
in galaxy evolution We study the Parkes half-Jansky sample of GPS radio galaxies of which now all host
galaxies have been identied and 80 has their redshifts determined 0122  z  1539 Analysis of the
absolute magnitudes of the GPS host galaxies show that at z  1 they are on average a magnitude fainter
than classical 3C radio galaxies This suggests that the AGN in young radio galaxies have not yet much
inuenced the overall properties of the host galaxy However their restframe UV luminosities indicate that
there is a low level of excess as compared to passive evolution models
1 GPS host galaxies are among the most massive ellipticals
GPS sources are very compact  1 radio sources with morphologies similar to extended
Fanaro  Riley III radio sources FRIIIs VLBI monitoring of GPS sources has shown these
sources to expand implying source ages of 1023 years only and likely to grow out to become
FRIIIs This makes GPS sources key objects for studying the early evolution of radio-loud AGN
the trigger of their nuclear activity and the importance of feedback in galaxy evolution
We investigate the Parkes Half-Jansky sample consisting of 48 GPS galaxies Snellen et al
2002 All host galaxies have now been identied and 39 have their redshift determined which
are in the range 0122  z  1539 de Vries et al 2007 Fig 1 shows the Hubble diagram of this
sample solid squares The new data at z1 conrm that GPS galaxies are on average 10 mag
fainter in this redshift range than 3C radio galaxies open circles This agrees with the hypothesis
that GPS galaxies are fainter and redder due to the lack of the extra blue light associated with the
radio-optical alignment eect For comparison a subset of the Luminous Red Galaxies LRGs
small circles sample Eisenstein et al 2001 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS are
shown The LRGs form a volume limited sample of the most luminous intrinsically red galaxies
out to z055 and are thought to represent the most massive early type galaxies many of which
are classied as Brightest Cluster Galaxies This gure shows that host galaxies of GPS radio
sources have similar optical luminosities to LRGs indicating that powerful young radio sources
are hosted by the most massive early type galaxies
2 Recent starbursts in galaxies with young AGN
We compare the absolute magnitudes of GPS galaxies solid squares and 3C radio galaxies
open circles to passive evolution models of single burst stellar populations Fig 2 left shows
stellar population models with solar metallicity and dierent formation redshifts z f 15 20 and
30 Fig 2 right shows models with dierent metallicities and a formation redshift of z f 15

Our data are in best agreement with a recent formation redshift of 15-20 with a possible range
of metallicities However it would be surprising if the entire host galaxies would have formed
so recently especially because g 1 indicates that GPS galaxies are massive early type galaxies
Therefore we interpret this result as evidence for recent starburst activity andor low level AGN
