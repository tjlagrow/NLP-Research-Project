1 Disk formation and viscosity
There are at least three main scenarios invoked for galaxy formation the rst one
inspired by Eggen et al 1962 is the monolithic collapse where the initial gas clouds
collapse gravitationally while forming quickly stars before the end of their collapse so
that they end up with a stellar spheroid Disks must then form later on through slower
gas accretion The second is the hierarchical scenario where the rst systems to form are
disks the star formation time-scale being longer than the collapse time Then the inter-
action and merger of two disks lead to the formation of a spheroid The third scenario
developped in this talk considers that disks form rst as in the second scenario How-
ever disks then may evolve without any merger with other galaxies Their own internal
evolution could also produce a spheroid at the center through secular evolution This
scenario assumes external gas accretion from laments of the cosmic web eg Kormendy
 Kennicutt 2004
Spontaneously a disk evolves through its gravitational instability producing non-
axisymmetric features or waves that will transfer angular momentum This is equivalent
to an eective kinematic viscosity Lin  Pringle 1987a The stability of the disk is
ensured at small scales by the equivalent pressure due to the disordered motions or
velocity dispersions All scales smaller than the Jeans length J  tf f  2G12
are stabilised where  is the velocity dispersion and  the density At large scales the
disk is stabilised by the dierential rotation and the subsequent shear All scales larger
than the critical Lcrit are stable where Lcrit  G2 with  the disk surface density
and  the epicyclic frequency Scales larger than J and lower than Lcrit remain un-
stable unless the velocity dispersion is increased until J  Lcrit this condition is the
Toomre criterion Toomre 1964 The parameter Q2  J Lcrit must be larger than 1
for stability From hydrostatic equilibrium in the z-direction the disk thickness must be
h  hr min1 Q with hr  
When instabilities occur they transfer momentum on scale Lcrit with time scale
1 or dynamical time-scale therefore a prescription for eective viscosity is  
r In addition it can be shown that when the viscous time-scale is

of the same order as the star-formation time-scale ie t  t then an exponential disk
is formed Lin  Pringle 1987b
2 Bars and gas ows
Bars are the most frequent non-axisymmetries developped in galaxy disks 75 of spiral
galaxies are barred when viewed in the near-infrared They form easily in numerical
simulations even when Q  1 Bars are very ecient to trasnfer angular momentum
They are robust and generate long-lived gravity torques acting on the gas to concentrate
mass towards the center The amount of gas driven towards the center can be quantied
by observations It can be shown that the sign of the torques change at each Lindblad
resonance in particular they are negative with respect to the sense of rotation inside
corotation CR and positive outside The amplitude of the torques depends on the bar
strength and on the phase shift between the gas response and the stellar potential Inside
CR the gas leads the stars and this corresponds to the characteristic morphology of dust
lanes leading the bar commonly observed in barred galaxies
From the near-infrared image representing the old stellar component ie most of the
mass in the visible disk it is possible to deduce the gravitational potential of the galaxy
From the gas map observed either through HI or CO lines it is then possible to compute
the average torque exerted on the gas at each radius assuming a stationary state at least
for one rotation These computations have shown that typically in a strongly barred
galaxy the gas may lose 30 of its angular momentum at each rotation Garcia-Burillo
et al 2005 The stellar bar receives the angular momentum lost by the gas and therefore
weakens the bar is a wave with negative momentum with most the orbits sustaining
the bar with high eccentricity The absorption of angular momentum makes the orbits
rounder and the bar weaker This can lead to the destruction of the bar eg Bournaud
 Combes 2002
The gas driven towards the center could fuel the supermassive black hole present in
every galaxy with bulge and trigger nuclear activity AGN It is however dicult to nd
direct evidence of correlation between AGN and bars since the evolution time-scales are
widely dierent the dynamical time-scale for the gas to ow to the center and to weaken
the bar is a few 108 yr while the AGN active phase is a few 107 yr To account for the large
frequency of bars in spite of their easy weakening and destruction another mechanism
has to re-form bars this is done through external gas accretion which replenishes the
disk and makes it unstable again to bar formation First gas is stalled outside the outer
resonance by the positive torques when the bar is strong When the bas is weakened
the external gas can then enter and fuel the disk intermittently
There is therefore a self-regulated cycle of bar formation and destruction the bar
forms in an unstable cold disk rich in gas The strong bar produces gas inow which
weakens or destroys the bar Gas accretion can then enter and re-juvenate the disk and
a new bar form A few percent in mass of gas infall is enough to transform a bar in
a lens Friedli et al 1994 Berentzen et al 1998 Bournaud et al 2002 2005 External
gas accretion is essential to drive the secular evolution of galaxy disks and to maintain
spirals and bars frequent enough in galaxies The observed bar frequency can be used to
quantify the accretion rate Block et al 2002 The required accretion rate corresponds
to the baryonic galaxy mass doubling in 7 Gyrs Cosmological simulations have recently
revealed the importance of cold gas inow in laments The predicted rate of gas accretion
is similar to what is required to maintain the observed bar frequency Dekel  Birnboim
A consequence of angular momentum redistribution over the disk by the bar is the
Secular Evolution
formation of exponential disks with radial breaks and dierent slopes in the outer parts
The break is expected at the outer Lindblad resonance Pfenniger  Friedli 1991 When
several patterns develop in the disk there could be several breaks at diernt radii Al-
ternatively breaks may also be the consequence of gas accumulation due to external
accretion together with a threshold of star formation in gas surface density Roskar et
al 2008 The galaxy disk then form inside out and the break moves radially outwards
This is conrmed through numerical simulations which show how the successive spirals
and bars transfer some of the inner stars to the outer parts Age and abundance gradients
can then change suddenly in the outer parts after the break limiting the location of new
star formation This can explain the frequent observations of these surprising reversals
for instance after a radius of 8kpc in M33 Williams et al 2009
3 Angular momentum transfers radial migration
There is a large eciency in the exchange of angular momentum by resonant scattering
at resonances due to several successive spiral patterns as shown by Sellwood  Binney
2002 leading to radial migration of stars and gas cf Figure 1
The principle is that at corotation it is possible to exchange angular momentum L
almost without heating Assuming a nearly steady spiral wave at least for a few rotations
there is an energy invariant the Jacobi integral in the p rotating frame
EJ  E  pL
and the energy and angular momentum are related by E  pL To separate
energy in the radial motions dening the radial action JR it can be shown that
 L
JR  
This shows that at corotation where p   changes in L do not cause changes in
JR ie no radial heating Exchanges of L will be most ecient near CR and the orbits
which are almost circular will be preferentially scattered as shown in Figure 1 This kind
of change in L without heating is called churning by Sellwood  Binney 2002 while
the change with increase of epicyclic amplitude through heating is called blurring since
it has specic signatures in the stellar orbits Gas contributes to churning while it is also
radially driven inwards
Figure 1 Exchange of angular momentum L as a function of L for all stars left and only
stars with small epicycles right The locations of Lindblad resonances ILR CR and OLR are
indicated by vertical lines The resonance scattering occurs mainly at corotation from Sellwood
 Binney 2002
F Combes
In real galaxies spiral waves are not steady but transient and develop with dierent
pattern speeds so the CR could span a wide range in radii Radial migration could then
involve most of the galaxy disk
This has important consequences on the chemical evolution and abundance gradients
The relation between metallicity and age is considerably scattered around a gross trend
as is observed Shoenrich  Binney 2009 There is also a large scatter in the OFe
versus FeH relation Radial migration can also produce a thick disk since stars in the
inner disks have higher z-velocity dispersion due to the higher restoring force of the disk
When migrating outwards they will feel a smaller restoring force towards the disk and
they will are This could explain both the -enriched and low metallicity property of
the thick disk
The transfer of angular momentum can be multiplied if several patterns exist with
resonances in common Both bars and spirals can participate to this overlap of resonances
Minchev  Famaey 2010 have shown that due to the non-linear coupling the region
aected by the migration is widened and the migration rate accelerated by a factor 3
Numerical simulations have conrmed the high migration rate due to coupled patterns
Minchev et al 2010 The exchange of angular momemtum has now maxima not only at
corotation but also at the OLR The presence of the gas increases the rate of angular
momentum exchange by about 20 Metallicity gradients can atten in less than 1 Gyr

to resonance overlap of bar and spiral waves Top row Stellar disk density contours of a giant

et al 2010
as shown in Figure 2 Again the migration is the most important for almost circular
orbits It can explain the absence of clear age metallicity relation or age velocity relation
Secular Evolution
4 Bulge formation
Several mechanisms are invoked to form bulges or spheroids First as suggested by
Toomre  Toomre 1972 major mergers of spiral galaxies can form an elliptical with
a remaining disk according to the relative alignment of their initial spins eg Bendo
 Barnes 2000 In minor mergers disks are more easily kept and progressively enrich
the classical bulge Secular evolution can also form spheroids bars and their vertical
resonance elevate stars in the center into what is called a pseudo-bulge The latter is
intermediate between a spheroid and a disk Pseudo-bulges are observed more frequently
in late-type galaxies A third mechanism is provided by clumpy galaxies at high redshift
The massive clumps through dynamical friction quickly spiral in and form a bulge
Bulges in fact are too easily formed and the main problem of the hierarchical scenario
is to form bulgeless galaxies These are observed with unexpected abundance at z0
As for mergers it is possible that most ellipticals are the result of multiple minor
mergers instead of a 11 mass ratio remnant Numerical simulations have shown that
the issue is not the mass ratio of individual mergers but the total mass accreted if at
least 30-40 of initial mass A large number of successive minor mergers can form an
elliptical galaxy for instance 50 mergers of 501 mass ratio Given the mass function of
galaxies multiple minor mergers are even more frequent than equal-mass major mergers

been known for a long time Combes  Sanders 1981 Combes et al 1990 During secular
evolution the resonance can move radially following the slowing down of the bar and
several peanuts can be formed larger and larger Martinez-Valpuesta et al 2006 Even
after the bar destruction the central stellar component will keep its thickness forming
a pseudo-bulge These spheroids formed in numerical simulations correspond perfectly
to the kind of pseudo-bulges so frequently observed in late-type galaxies They have
characteristics intermediate between a classical bulge or an elliptical and a normal disk
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 their main properties are
 a luminosity distribution  in magnitude with a Sersic index   r1n with
n  1  2 exponential disks have n  1 elliptical galaxies n  4 or larger
 a attening degree similar to disks with typical boxpeanut shapes and blue colors
 their kinematics show more rotation support than classical bulges
Concerning the early evolution of galaxies their percentage of gas is so high that
their disk is unstable and fragments in a few massive clumps With stars forming in
those clumps this scenario explains the formation of the clumpy galaxies observed at
high redshift which appear as chain galaxies when edge-on Numerical simulations then
show the rapid formation of exponential disks and bulges through dynamical friction
Noguchi 1999 Bournaud et al 2007b The evolution time-scale might even be shorter
than with spirals and bars given the contrast of the structures
Many spiral galaxies are observed with a thick disk distinct from their younger thin
disk where contemporary stars are forming This thick disk could trace some features
of the galaxy past formation At least 4 scenarios have been invoked for the thick disk
formation
 1 Accretion and disruption of satellites like in the stellar halo
 2 Disk heating due to minor merger
 3 Radial migration via resonant scattering
 4 In-situ formation from thick gas disk mergers or clumpy galaxies
Sales et al 2009 recently proposed that orbit excentricity of stars could help to dis-
entangle among these scenarios
5 Conclusion
The gravitational stability of disks the dynamics of spiral perturbations and the
feedback cycle generated may explain the formation of exponential disks with ecient
kinematic viscosity Angular momentum exchange are also very ecient with bars which
gravity torques drive the gas towards the center in a few dynamical times In addition
resonant scattering by spiral waves constantly re-generated with dierent pattern speed
are ecient to produce radial migration of stars and gas When overlap of resonances
occurs between spirals or between spiral and bars the migration is strong and spans
the whole disk
If classical bulges and spheroids are commonly the results of mergers secular evolution
can also form the pseudo-bulges through vertical resonance with the bar Bulges in
early and late-type galaxies could be formed by a combination of these two mechanisms
Presently it is very dicult to explain the presence of a large number of bulge-less
galaxies the more so as clumpy galaxies formed by gas instabilities at high redshift will
also form massive bulges through dynamical friction
Several scenarios have been invoked for thick disk formation and a detailed study of
stellar orbits could help to discriminate among them

Discussion
J Toomre There are large amounts of gas required for accretion Is there evidence
of this infalling gas and how could this gas accretion be tested or observed around
galaxies
F Combes It is dicult to nd direct evidence since the infalling gas is diuse Around
our own galaxy high velocity HI clouds have been observed for a long time and with
simple models giving their distance they would correspond to an infall of a few solar
masses per year Around external galaxies the search is dicult by lack of sensitivity It
is possible that the ubiquitous warps in spiral galaxies come from external accretion A
stream of HI gas emission has been observed in the edge-on galaxy NGC 891 up to 25kpc
distance It is interesting to note that cosmological simulations predict gas accretion with
the right order of magnitude to maintain spiral and bars in galaxies
