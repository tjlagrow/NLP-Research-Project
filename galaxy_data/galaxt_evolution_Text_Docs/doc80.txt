Abstract
In this review I highlight the role played by spectrophotometric models in the study of galaxy
evolution in distant clusters I summarize the main achievements of the modeling of ka
spectra the derivation of the star formation rate in emission-line galaxies and the stellar
ages of red cluster galaxies The current knowledge of the dependence of the star formation
histories on the galaxy morphology and luminosity is also presented
Introduction
The goal of any spectrophotometric modeling is to reconstruct the star formation
history of galaxies to learn what has been the star formation rate SFR at each epoch and as
a consequence the enrichment history of metals and the evolution of the galactic luminosity
and mass In this review I focus on galaxies in mostly distant clusters z  02 and present
the main results obtained using spectrophotometric modeling as a tool to interpret the data
Quite a few of the spectrophotometric models available today have the ability to include
the three main components that produce the spectral energy distribution of a galaxy 1
the stellar contribution 2 the emission lines and emission continuum from gas ionized by
young massive stars and 3 the extinction due to dust Nowadays it is common to include
stellar populations of different metallicities and models can have sufcient wavelength res-
olution 3 - 4  or better to study stellar absorption features in detail
In this context it is useful to think of three types of spectra those with emission lines and
among those without emission lines ka and passive spectra For each one of these types
of spectra there is a stellar time scale associated  5  107 yr for emission-line spectra the
lifetime of the massive stars able to ionize the gas between 5  107 and 15  109 yr for
ka spectra the period during which stars with strong Balmer lines dominate the integrated
spectrum of a stellar system and  15  109 yr for passive spectra Each one of these
spectral types is described and discussed below

ka Spectra
Historically ka spectra originally named EAs also known as H-strong galax-
ies etc were the rst type of spectra to be noticed and modeled in distant cluster studies
They are spectra with no emission lines and strong Balmer lines in absorption EWH  3
 A strong-lined example of a ka galaxy is shown in Figure 11 and contrasted with a
passive spectrum
The second paper that appeared presenting spectra of distant cluster galaxies already
pointed out what is still the current interpretation of the strongest ka spectra that they
indicate a large burst of star formation 109 years before the light left the galaxy Dressler

Shioya Bekki  Couch 2001 and Shioya et al 2002 The main conclusions of ka
modeling can be summarized as follows
1 In ka galaxies star formation stopped typically between 5 107 and 15 109 yr before the
epoch at which the galaxy is observed The evolution of the equivalent width of H versus
color is shown in Figure 12 This diagram reproduces a plot from the inuential paper
of Couch  Sharples 1987 Soon after the moment when star formation is interrupted
the galaxy moves in this diagram toward higher EWH and progressively redder colors
reaching a maximum in EWH after 3- 5  108 yr Then the strength of the line starts to
decline until the locus occupied by typical ellipticals is reached in the right bottom corner
of the plot
2 Spectra with very strong EWH above 5  require a starburst prior to the truncation of the
star formation with high galactic mass fractions involved in the burst 1020 or higher
ka spectra with a moderate H line on the other hand may be post-starburst galaxies in
a late stage of evolution but may also be reproduced by simply interrupting normal star
formation activity The 5  limit mentioned above should only be considered indicative
given the strong dependence of the EW value on the method adopted to measure it the
strength of the lines should always be measured in the same way on data and models
3 A combination of EWH and color such as that shown in Figure 12 can help in roughly
estimating the time elapsed since the halting of star formation A more sophisticated method
to age date the starburst using Balmer-line indices can be found in Leonardi  Rose 1996
4 A slowly declining SFR with a time scale comparable to or longer than that of the ka
phase 1 Gyr or longer is not able to produce a ka spectrum which is more easily obtained
if the star formation is halted quickly The reason for such behavior is that while the SFR is
slowly declining emission lines are still present in the galaxy spectrum thus the galaxy will
not be classied as a ka When nally the star formation terminates the contribution of
A-type stars to the integrated spectrum is low due to the low average level of star formation
during the previous Gyr
A great advantage of the ka spectral classication is the fact that in principle it requires

emission-line galaxies by lled red galaxies and empty blue galaxies circles The dashed
region shows the locus of typical spirals today which generally display emission lines and
therefore are comparable to the crosses in this diagram Ellipticals occupy the bottom right
region of this diagram at B - R  2 mag and EWH  1  The lines are evolutionary
sequences of galaxies in which star formation is halted with or without a starburst preceding
the quenching of star formation The former case is shown as a dottedcontinuous line
leading downward from the spiral sequence while examples of truncated models with no
starbursts are the solid tracks leading upward from the spiral sequence

ratio and must be coupled with a complete inspection of the spectrum to verify the absence
of any emission line Analysis of the other higher-order lines of the Balmer series usually

greatly helps in conrming the strength of H Moreover modeling of ka spectra is rela-
tively simple the age-metallicity degeneracy that affects the interpretation of passive spectra
is not an issue here because the effect in the strength of the Balmer lines is so large that only
age can be the cause for it The strong Balmer lines arise in A- to F-type stars which are
stars of  2 solar masses on the main sequence hence in a well known and easily modeled
evolutionary phase
The importance of ka modeling depends obviously on the importance of the ka phe-
nomenon in cluster galaxy data Many works see list above have found distant clusters
to host a signicant number of ka galaxies If ka spectra occur proportionally more in
distant clusters than in the eld at similar redshifts as found eg by Dressler et al 1999
but see Balogh et al 1999 for a different view then they provide strong evidence that
star formation is rapidly quenched in clusters and they could be used as tracers both of the
star formation history of galaxies infalling into clusters and of the infall history itself The
strongest ka spectra are a solid signature of a recent starburst whether this burst was or
was not induced by the cluster environment is still an open issue and a subject of ongoing
investigation
Finally it is not a mere intellectual exercise to note that if a galaxy formed all of its stars on
a short time scale as ellipticals are expected to do in a monolithic-collapse scenario of galaxy
formation then there must have been a phaseepoch when it displayed a spectacular ka
spectrum of an almost pure single stellar population dominated by A stars In an   07
H0  70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1 cosmology a galaxy forming all stars within 05 Gyr between z  3
and z  25 would appear as a ka until z  15 If it stopped forming stars at z  2 it would
still be recognizable as a ka at z  13 The ka phase of massive ellipticals might be within
reach and possibly we have begun observing it van Dokkum  Stanford 2003
Emission-line Spectra and Dust
The luminosities of some emission lines in an integrated spectrum can be used to
infer the current SFR in a galaxy because as schematically described below for H the
luminosity of the line is proportional to the number of ionizing photons In a star-forming
galaxy the number of ionizing photons is proportional to the number of massive young stars
and for a given stellar initial mass function to the total current SFR
LH  Nion- photons  Nmassive- stars  SFR
In distant galaxy studies the O II 3727 line is often used instead of H because the
latter is redshifted out of the optical window Spectrophotometric models are used to deter-
mine the proportionality coefcient between Nion- photons and Nmassive- stars and they provide
the standard relations between the SFR and the luminosity of the lines Kennicutt 1992
SFR  09  10- 41 LH EH M yr- 1
SFR  20  10- 41 LO II EH M yr- 1
where the line luminosity is in erg s- 1 and EH is the extinction correction factor at H A
major uncertainty in these estimates is therefore the extinction by dust
Modeling has focused on starburst and dusty galaxies while little theoretical work has
been done on galaxies forming stars in a continuous regular fashion which are another
B M Poggianti
sizable component present in distant clusters In the following I will not treat the quies-
cent star-forming galaxies but will summarize the modeling results for starburst and dusty
galaxies
Several lines of evidence suggest that dust can play an important role in some distant
cluster galaxies In the optical spectra with weak to moderate O II emission and unusually
strong higher-order Balmer lines were noted to represent a nonnegligible fraction of both
cluster and eld spectra Dressler et al 1999 It was realized that in the local Universe
such spectra are rare among normal spirals while they are common in infrared-luminous
starburst galaxies which are known to have large dust extinction Poggianti et al 1999
Poggianti  Wu 2000 see also Liu  Kennicutt 1995 Hence regardless of the weakness
of their emission lines these galaxies were suggested to be in a starburst phase in which the
dust extinction works selectively the youngest stellar generations are more affected by dust
obscuration than older stellar populations which have had time to free themselves or drift
away from their dust cocoons
Models with selective extinction are empirically motivated by observations of star-forming
regions in nearby galaxies and they explain why different values of EB - V  are usually
measured within the same spectrum when using different spectral features for example why
the extinction measured from the emission lines is usually stronger than that measured from
the continuum Selective extinction is consistent with the fact that in the nearby Universe
galaxies with the highest current SFR are generally not those with the strongest emission
lines which tend to be low-mass very late-type galaxies of moderate total SFR
Quantitative modeling of these dusty spectra have been done by Shioya  Bekki 2000
Shioya et al 2001 Bekki et al 2001 and Poggianti Bressan  Franceschini 2001c
While a dust-screen model with any extinction law preserves the equivalent width of the
lines because it affects both the line and the underlying continuum by a proportional amount
an age-selective extinction can produce this peculiar spectral combination with weak emis-
sion lines originating in regions with highly extincted young massive stars and exception-
ally strong higher-order Balmer absorption lines from exposed intermediate-age stars
While a spectrum with moderate emission and unusually strong Balmer lines in absorp-
tion is therefore a good candidate for a starburst galaxy it has been shown that this modeling
is highly degenerate that this peculiar type of spectra does not guarantee SFRs above a cer-
tain limit and that the total SFR remains unknown without dust-free SFR estimators such as
far-infrared or radio continuum uxes Radio continuum observations of a cluster at z  04
for example surprisingly have detected some of the strongest ie youngest ka galax-
ies in the cluster Smail et al 1999 suggesting that star formation might still be ongoing
and be totally obscured at O II by dust in some of the kas see also the H detection
in some kas by Balogh  Morris 2000 and Miller  Owen 2002 Mid-infrared 15 m
data obtained with ISOCAM have been used to estimate the far-infrared ux and therefore
the SFR in distant clusters Duc et al 2002 As described in Duc et al 2003 ISOCAM
observations of a cluster at z  055 have yielded an unexpectedly high number of cluster
members that are luminous infrared galaxies with exceptionally high SFRs
Passive Galaxies and Evolutionary Links
A large fraction of galaxies in clusters up to z  1 have passive non-ka non-
emission-line spectra The evolutionary histories of the passive galaxies are the subject of
other reviews and contributed talks in these proceedings see Franx 2003 and Treu 2003

thus I will limit the following discussion to a description of the most fundamental contribu-
tions given to this area of research by spectrophotometric models
The ages of the stellar populations in luminous early-type galaxies in clusters are known
to be old Solid evidence for this comes from the analysis and evolution of the red color-
magnitude CM sequence in clusters whose slope scatter and zeropoint indicate a passive
evolution of stars formed at z  2- 3 Bower Lucey  Ellis 1992 Aragn-Salamanca Ellis

Bower 2001 van Dokkum  Franx 2001 Vazdekis et al 2001 Studies of the fundamental
plane mass-to-light ratios and the magnesium-velocity dispersion relation agree with these
ndings Bender Ziegler  Bruzual 1996 van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Kelson et al 1997
2000 2001 Ziegler  Bender 1997 Bender et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 1998 Ziegler
et al 2001 though they are necessarily limited to the brightest subset of galaxies
How can these results be reconciled with the presence of numerous blue galaxies in dis-
tant clusters the Butcher-Oemler effect given that these blue star-forming galaxies have
largely disappeared ie become red by z  0 This has been investigated by works
that have modeled the evolution of galaxy colors and magnitudes Bower Kodama  Ter-
levich 1998 Smail et al 1998 Kodama  Bower 2001 Figure 13 presents the results of
Kodama  Bower 2001 who have shown that by evolving the observed CM diagram of
intermediate-redshift clusters it is possible to obtain a diagram at z  0 that is mostly com-
posed of red galaxies similar to the observed CM diagram of the Coma cluster Moreover it
is now clear that the CM red sequence of clusters is comprised not only of early-type galax-
ies but also contains morphologically classied spirals Poggianti et al 1999 Couch et al
2001 Terlevich et al 2001 Balogh et al 2002 Goto et al 2003a b
These results imply that the CM sequence today is composed of a varied population of
galaxies with different star formation histories As shown by several works including the
one by Kodama  Bower 2001 although the principal driver of the CM sequence is the
correlation between galaxy luminosity and metallicity there is still room for a relatively
recent epoch of star formation activity in a signicant fraction of the today red galaxies
When contrasting this with the homogeneity and old ages of red sequence galaxies derived
from CM and fundamental plane studies it is important to take into account two aspects the
morphological transformations in clusters and the evolution of the galaxy luminosities
141 Morphological Evolution
The morphological mix of galaxies in clusters at various redshifts strongly suggests
that a signicant fraction of the spirals in distant clusters have evolved into the S0s or more
generally the early-type galaxies that dominate clusters today Dressler et al 1997 Fasano
et al 2000 van Dokkum et al 2000 Lubin Oke  Postman 2002 see Dressler 2003 This
morphological evolution is likely to lead to a progenitor bias in distant clusters we would
be observing as early-type galaxies only the oldest subset of the present-day early-types
those that were already assembled and stopped forming stars at high redshift van Dokkum
 Franx 1996 2001 Stanford et al 1998
The signature of relatively recent star formation activity in some of the early-type galaxies
in clusters has been searched for in several ways Recently signicant differences between

Thomas 2002 Many of these works derive luminosity-weighted ages and metallicities by
comparing a metallicity-sensitive and an age-sensitive spectral index with a grid of spec-
trophotometric models Similarly an age-sensitive and a metallicity-sensitive color index
can be used as shown in Figure 14 Smail et al 2001 The plot shows the color-color
diagram of galaxies in Abell 2218 at z  017 where a group of faint S0 galaxies is seen
to lie at younger luminosity-weighted ages lower V -
I color than all the ellipticals and

and constant metallicity pseudo-vertical lines As shown in the legend of the plot the
group of galaxies with younger ages lower V -
I colors than the rest are all S0 galaxies
the rest of the S0s The possibility of a spiral-to-S0 transformation has been quantitatively
investigated in terms of galaxy numbers and morphologies by Kodama  Smail 2001 and
from the spectrophotometric point of view by Bicker Fritz-v Alvensleben  Fricke 2002
providing interesting constraints on the possible evolutionary paths
However not all studies nd differences between S0s and ellipticals Ellis et al 1997
Jrgensen 1999 and references therein Jones Smail  Couch 2000 and Ziegler et al
2001 do not detect a signicant morphological dependence of the stellar population ages
and metallicities in early-type cluster galaxies It is important to stress that the presence
of recent star formation in S0s has never been detected in the brightest S0s but becomes a
prominent effect when probing fainter down the luminosity function For example Coma
B M Poggianti
Fig 15 Fraction of galaxies observed as blue at intermediate redshifts three clusters at
z  02 03 and 04 as a function of the present-day z  0 absolute V magnitude The
z  0 magnitude is computed assuming a decline of star formation as a consequence of the
accretion onto the cluster From Kodama  Bower 2001
S0s with recent star formation are fainter than M  13 as expected given the luminosi-
ties of their possible spiral progenitors at intermediate redshift Poggianti et al 2001b
When studying the dependence of the stellar population properties on the morphological
type of galaxies it is therefore important to simultaneously disentangle the dependence on
the galaxy luminosity and to consider the effects of luminosity evolution This is further
discussed in the following section
Luminosity Evolution
There are two aspects of the evolution of galaxy luminosities that are important to
stress The rst aspect already mentioned above is the fading As discussed in 12 the
B M Poggianti
interruption of star formation seems to be a phenomenon involving a signicant fraction of
the cluster galaxies As a consequence galaxies not only become redder but also fainter this
evolution in luminosity is obviously stronger than the evolution occurring both in the case of
passive evolution of an old population and in the case of a galaxy continuously forming stars
with no large variation in SFR until z  0 Kodama  Bower 2001 computed the expected
fraction of previously blue galaxies as a function of the present-day absolute magnitude as
shown in Figure 15 starting from the CM diagram of three intermediate-redshift clusters
and computing the luminosity evolution using models with truncated star formation The
gure shows how the fraction of present-day red galaxies that were blue at higher redshift
increases progressively as one goes fainter The relevance of the fading and the evolution as
a function of galaxy luminosity are discussed also in many other works Postman Lubin 
Oke 1998 Smail et al 1998 2001 van Dokkum et al 1998 Terlevich et al 1999 Ferreras
 Silk 2000 Poggianti et al 2001b Shioya et al 2002 Merluzzi et al 2003 Tran et al
Related to this there is a second interesting point related to luminosity known as the
downsizing effect the fact that as one goes to lower redshifts the maximum luminos-
itymass of galaxies with signicant star formation activity seems to be progressively de-
creasing possibly both in clusters Bower et al 1999 and in the eld Cowie et al 1996
An attempt to derive the distribution of luminosity-weighted ages as a function of galaxy
luminosity over a range of almost 7 magnitudes has been done for Coma in a new magnitude
limited spectroscopic survey Poggianti et al 2001a
In this study spectrophotometric
models were also used to derive luminosity-weighted ages for spectra without emission lines
the great majority in Coma from index-index diagrams These ages give a rough estimate
of the time elapsed since the latest star formation activity stopped This time has been
transformed into a cosmological epoch ie redshift adopting an   07 H0  70 km
s- 1 Mpc- 1 cosmology About half of all non-emission-line galaxies of any magnitude in
Coma show no detectable star formation activity during the last 9 Gyr ie since z  15
The other half do show signs of some star formation below this redshift and interestingly
display a trend of epoch of latest star formation with galaxy magnitude recent z  025 star
formation is detected in 2530 of the dwarf galaxies while only in 510 of the giant
galaxies In contrast 3040 of the giants reveal some star formation at intermediate
redshifts 025  z  15 compared to 1520 for the dwarfs
Overall including all galaxies with MB between - 21 and - 14 mag the fraction of galaxies
with signs of star formation at the various epochs is presented in Figure 16 left Going
a step forward one can try to quantify the stellar mass involved transforming the observed
luminosities into a mass by adopting the mass-to-light ratio of a single stellar population with
an age equal to the luminosity-weighted age derived from the spectral indices As shown
in the right panel of Figure 16 galaxies with some star formation below z  1 account for
only about 20 of the mass and those with some star formation at z  025 for only 3
of the mass being mostly low-mass dwarf galaxies Note that this is not the mass fraction
formed at each epoch but it is the total mass in those galaxies that had some unquantied
star formation An example of an attempt to estimate the total mass fraction formed at each
redshift using population synthesis models of cluster galaxy colors and magnitudes can be
found in Merluzzi et al 2003 who nd for quiescent non-starbursting star formation
histories that about 20 of the mass was formed below redshift 1
Other evidence of a downsizing effect comes from ka galaxies in clusters at low redshift

ages derived from spectral index diagrams in Poggianti et al 2001a Right The number

formation during the three epochs see text
A number of works have investigated the presence of Balmer-strong absorption-line galaxies
in nearby clusters especially in Coma Caldwell et al 1993 1996 Caldwell  Rose 1997
1998 Caldwell Rose  Dendy 1999 Castander et al 2001 Rose et al 2001 Some of
these works have highlighted the tendency of these Balmer-strong galaxies to be intrinsically
fainter than the ka galaxies observed at high redshift In our Coma survey Mobasher et al
2001 Poggianti et al 2001a we have found no luminous ka galaxy down to a magnitude-
limit comparable to the MORPHS limit at z  05 while there are strong and frequent cases
among faint Coma galaxies at MV  - 185 mag At these magnitudes 10 to 15 of the
cluster galaxies are kas and many of these dwarf spectra are exceptionally strong post-
starburst galaxies Poggianti et al 2003
Summary
In this contribution I have summarized the main achievements of spectrophotomet-
ric modeling of galaxy evolution in distant clusters Five main points have been mentioned
1 ka spectra unequivocally indicate post-star-forming or post-starburst galaxies depending
on the strength of the Balmer lines
B M Poggianti
2 A galaxy with weak to moderate emission lines and strong Balmer lines in absorption is a
good candidate for an ongoing starburst or a galaxy currently forming stars at a vigorous
3 There are observed differences in the stellar population ages between ellipticals and S0
galaxies that are consistent with a signicant fraction of the latter having evolved from star-
forming spirals at intermediate redshifts This result is not universal though and probing
sufciently faint magnitudes seems to be crucial for detecting any difference at least at low
redshift
4 The CM sequence in clusters today appears to be a mixed bag The slope is dominated by
metallicity but there is room for relatively recent star formation in a signicant fraction of
the galaxies The bright end of the CM sequence seems to be populated by homogeneously
old galaxies while more and more remnants of galaxies with star formation at intermediate
redshifts z  05 can be found as one goes fainter along the sequence
5 Related to the previous point a downsizing effect is observed in clusters probably in
parallel to a similar effect in the eld toward lower redshifts the maximum luminositymass
of galaxies with signicant star formation activity progressively decreases The downsizing
effect could be responsible of the fact that ka cluster spectra appear to occur in luminous
galaxies at z  05 and in faint mostly dwarf galaxies at z  0
In the next few years the efforts of spectrophotometric modeling will likely concentrate
on modeling at higher redshifts than it has been done so far in order to aid the interpretation
of the large photometric and spectroscopic data sets that are being acquired in clusters at
05  z  15 We can expect further progress also at low redshift where the model im-
provements especially regarding the metal abundance ratios coupled with the new large
surveys of nearby clusters and groups are expected to reveal detailed characteristics of clus-
ter galaxies that can be helpful in constraining their formation histories As more and better
data are obtained the most important contribution of the modeling will be the endeavor to
reach a quantitative general picture that can simultaneously account for the observations at
all redshifts
