1 The Multiphase Model applied to Bulges
We present the multiphase model applied to a set of bulges This model
was rst applied to the Solar Neighborhood and then to the Galactic
Disk by computing the radial dependence of input parameters which
govern the gas accumulation in the disk and the cloud and star forma-
tion processes These processes result enhanced in the central region
due to the volume eect The evolution of the Galactic bulge was
thus directly obtained Molla  Ferrini 1995 with the same set of
eciencies and characteristic collapse time scale dened for the disk
We have also applied the model to a sample of spiral disks by changing
the input parameters according their total masses and Hubble types
With the same approach used for our Bulge we now extend the model
to their bulges Molla et al 2000
The resulting SFR in the central regions shows a intense initial
episode in the rst Gyr Surface densities for atomic and molecular
gas of later type bulges are higher than those of earlier types The
predicted Galactic bulge mean metallicity FeH  017 and the
corresponding metallicity distribution are in excellent agreement with
data Mean stellar abundances are subsolar for all modelled bulges
T  3 independently of the Hubble type the arm class andor the
luminosity of their host galaxies reproducing the estimations from color
data The ratio between past and present SFR and the abundance
MgFe are correlated with the Hubble type they decrease for late
type bulges The predicted spectral indices Mg2 and F e52 computed
by evolutionary synthesis models are also similar to those observed
