Abstract Galaxy interactions expel a signicant amount of stars and
gas into the surrounding environment I review the formation and evo-
lution of the tidal debris spawned during these collisions and describe
how this evolution depends on the large scale environment in which the
galaxies live In addition to acting as a long-lived tracer of the interaction
history of galaxies the evolution of this material  on both large scales
and small  has important ramications for galactic recycling processes
the feeding of the intracluster light and intracluster medium within galaxy
clusters and the delayed formation of galactic disks and dwarf galaxies
1 The Physics of Tidal Tails
The large-scale dynamical evolution of tidal debris is governed largely by simple
gravitational physics As rst elegantly shown in simulations by Toomre 
Toomre 1972 and Wright 1972 the tidal forces acting on spiral galaxies
during a close encounter coupled with the galaxies rotational motion draw out
long slender tidal tails of gas and stars An example of this process is shown in
Figure 1 As the galaxies pass by each other on the rst passage tidal forces give
disk material sucient energy to escape the inner potential well The symmetric
nature of tidal forces means that streams are torn o both the near side and
far side with respect to pericenter of the disks the near side material forms a
tidal bridge between the disks which typically does not physically connect
depending on orbital geometry while the far side material forms the tidal tails
The formation of tidal tails is a strong function of the orbital geometry  tidal
tails are strongest in prograde encounters where the spin and orbital angular
momentum vectors are even moderately aligned while retrograde encounters
yield weak tails at best The length of the tidal tails is further pronounced due
to the orbital decay of the merging pair eg Barnes 1988 which causes the
galaxies to fall away from their tails as they merge together
Once launched tidal tails are not in simple expansion Figure 2 shows the
kinematic structure of the tidal tails shown in Figure 1 observed 12 Gyr after
the merger is complete Most of the material remains bound to the remnant
on loosely bound elliptical orbits with only the relatively small fraction at the
tip of the tails being unbound The radial velocity curve shows this orbital
structure well the loosely bound outer portion of the tails are still expanding
while material at the base of the tails has already reach apocenter and has
started falling back in towards the merger remnant This velocity structure

Evolution of the tidal debris in an equal-mass merger of
results in a continual stretching of the tidal tails  they are long-lived and do
not simply expand away although their surface brightness drops rapidly due to
this dynamical evolution Mihos 1995 One important caveat to this description
is the depth of the galaxies potential well a deep potential well provided by
extended dark matter halos will result in less unbound material and a more
rapid fall-back of the tidal debris to the parent galaxy Dubinski et al 1996

The material forming the tidal tails comes from a wide range of initial
radii in the progenitor disks During close passages tidal forces are eective at
dredging up material from the inner disk and expelling it into the tidal debris
In the simulation shown in Figure 1 scaled to Milky Way sized progenitors
the extended tidal tails are formed from material originally outside the solar
circle while the loops and shells which fall back in the rst Gyr after the merger
include a signicant amount of material from the solar circle and inwards This
tidal dredge-up means that tidal debris will be moderately metal rich since it
is not simply the outer parts of the disks involved To demonstrate this eect
The Evolution of Tidal Debris
we imprint a metallicity distribution on the stellar disk model of dFeHdR
 005 kpc1 normalized to solar metallicity at the solar circle Observed
12 Gyr after the merger is complete we see that a signicant amount of the
debris in the outer stellar tidal tails has metallicities above 13 solar A similar
exercise for the gas skews the results towards lower metallicities for a number of
reasons Gas disks are typically more extended than stellar disks for a similar
radial gradient there will be more low metallicity material in the gas than the
stars Additionally the gas from the inner regions which would have provided
higher metallicity gas in the tails does not survive the tidal expulsion process
instead shocks and gravitational torques drive the gas inwards to the center
of the remnant where it fuels the merger-induced starburst instead Mihos 
Hernquist 1996 Barnes  Hernquist 1996
2 Galactic Recycling
While on large scales the evolution of tidal debris is largely a gravitational
phenomenon on smaller scales a variety of mechanisms can drive structure for-
mation within the tidal tails Overdensities can form in the tidal tails either
through gravitational collapse of small scale instabilities in the progenitor disks
Barnes  Hernquist 1992 or by cooling and fragmentation of structure in the
tidal expelled gas Elmegreen et al 1993 This has led to the suggestion that
dwarf galaxies may form within the tidal debris of merging galaxies Observa-
tions have detected a number of discrete often star-forming sources in the tidal
debris of interacting galaxies eg Duc these proceedings whether or not these
are truly bound objects destined to become dwarf galaxies remains to be seen
We can use simulations of interacting galaxies to make predictions for the
properties of any tidally spawned dwarfs Coming from material stripped from
their progenitor disks they should have moderate metallicities and travel on
loosely bound highly eccentric orbits Hibbard  Mihos 1995 They are un-
likely to have signicant amounts of dark matter since the kinematically hot
dark matter will not collapse into the shallow potential wells Barnes  Hern-
quist 1992 formed from small-scale instabilities in the tails Finally these tidal
dwarfs may well show dierent generations of stellar populations as they arise
in a mixed medium of old stellar disk material and young stars formed from the
gaseous tidal debris
The dynamical stretching of the tidal debris means that it should be hard
for these condensations to grow continuously On small scales bound structures
can form but continual accretion onto these structures will be limited by shear in
the surrounding material In this context it is important to make a cautionary
note about claims that large tidally spawned HI complexes are often found
preferentially at the end of optical tidal tails Dynamically it is unclear why
this would be  HI tails often extend much further out than the optical tails
do and there is not clear reason why the end of the optical tails should be a
dynamically important spot It is more likely that many of these objects are the
result of projection eects Tidal tails are curved and a sightline which passes
along the tangent point to a curving tail will not only give the appearance of
marking the end of the tail but also will project along a large column of HI
articially giving the impression that a massive HI complex lives at the end of

a tidal tails see eg Hibbard these proceedings but also Bournaud et al 2003
for an alternative view
The other context in which tidal debris is important in galactic recycling
is the return of gas from the infalling tidal debris As shown in 1 material in
the tidal tails remains bound and will continue to fall back to the remnant over
many Gyr The return is ordered Hibbard  Mihos 1995 the rst material
to return is the most bound lowest angular momentum material which will fall
back to small radius As the remnant evolves high angular momentum loosely
bound material will fall back to increasingly larger radius
This long-lived rain of tidal debris on the merger remnant manifests it-
self in a number of ways Diuse loops and shells form as the stars fall back
through and wrap around the remnant while the infalling gas can dissipate en-
ergy and settle into a warped rotating disk Mihos  Hernquist 1996 Naab 
Burkert 2001 Barnes 2002 such as those found in the nearby elliptical galaxies
NGC 4753 Steiman-Cameron et al 1992 and Centaurus A Nicholson et al
1992 The most loosely bound tidal material forms less-well organized struc-
tures outside of a few eective radii as it falls back and may be the source of the
extended HI gas found in shells and broken rings around many elliptical galaxies
eg Schminovich  van Gorkom 1997 More speculatively if the returning
gas can eciently form stars this process provides a mechanism for rebuilding
stellar disks For example the gaseous disk inside the merger remnant NGC
7252 is rapidly forming stars Hibbard et al 1994 and may ultimately result in
a kiloparsec-scale stellar disk embedded in the r
4 spheroid formed in the merger
If signicant amount of tidal material exists to reform a stellar disk it may even
be possible for the remnant to eventually evolve towards a bulge-dominated S0
or Sa galaxy eg Schweizer 1998
3 Tidal Debris in Clusters
Many dynamical avenues are available to drive tidal evolution in cluster galaxies
The most obvious is the cluster potential itself particularly for galaxies whose
orbit takes them close to the cluster center eg Henriksen  Byrd 1996 More
recently the importance of repeated fast collisions in stripping cluster galaxies
has been emphasized by Moore et al 1996 1998 However because of the large
velocity dispersion within galaxy clusters conventional wisdom held that strong
interactions and mergers between cluster galaxies were rare Ostriker 1980
More recently a greater understanding of the nature of hierarchical clus-
tering is changing this view While slow encounters are rare for an individual
galaxy falling into a well-established environment eg Ghigna et al 1998
many galaxies are accreted onto clusters from within the small group environ-
ment Clusters show ample evidence for substructure in X-rays galaxy popula-
tions and velocity structure see eg reviews by Buote 2002 Girardi  Biviano
2002 Interactions within infalling groups can be strong  witness for example
the classic interacting pair the Mice NGC 4676 found in the outskirts of the
Coma cluster Clearly strong interactions can and do occur during the evolution
of clusters either early as the cluster forms or late as groups are accreted from
the eld
The Evolution of Tidal Debris
The eects of the cluster potential on the evolution of tidal debris during
a slow encounter can be dramatic To illustrate this Fig 3 shows the evolution
of the same merger shown in Fig 1 except this time occurring in a Coma-like
cluster potential The orbit of the galaxy pair in the cluster carries it within 05
Mpc of the cluster core with an orbital period of  35 Gyr As the galaxies
merge the very loosely bound material forming the tidal tails is now subjected
to the large scale tidal eld of the cluster and is very eciently stripped out of
the galactic potential altogether
Figure 3
Evolution of an equal-mass merger identical to that in
Fig 1 but occurring as the system orbits through a Coma-like cluster
potential see text Note the rapid stripping of the tidal tails early in
the simulation the tidal debris seen here is more extended and diuse
than in the eld merger and late infall is shut o due to tidal stripping
by the cluster potential
An extremely important facet of this kind of encounter is the enhanced
eciency of the tidal stripping This is shown in Figure 4 which shows the
fraction of material stripped to large radius r  35 kpc or approximately 5
Re in the simulation in the eld and cluster versions of the simulations as well
as in a single disk galaxy on the same cluster orbit The combination of the
local and cluster tides causes signicant stripping  encounters of galaxies in
small infalling groups eectively prime the pump for the cluster tides to do
their work Indeed the individual disk galaxy is hardly tidally stripped at all
suggesting that estimates of tidal stripping based on the tidal radius of individual
galaxies falling into a cluster potential may signicantly underestimate the eect
The combined eects of galactic and cluster tides not only raise the e-
ciency of tidal stripping they also result in particularly deep stripping That is
the stronger galactic tides can strip material out from deep in the galaxies po-
tential well which is then vulnerable to the gentler but long-lived cluster tides
that liberate it entirely As a result the stripped material will be relatively
high in metallicity coming from the inner parts of the disk and has a mean
metallicity of FeH025 with a signicant spread This has important con-
sequences for studies of the intracluster light ICL particularly in terms of
J Christopher Mihos
Figure 4 Material stripped to large radius r  35 kpc for the
isolated merger the cluster merger and a isolated spiral orbiting in
the cluster potential Cluster peri passages are shown as dashed lines
Note that most of the tidal material in the isolated merger remains
bound to the remnant while it is unbound in the cluster merger
searches for individual intracluster stars which are sensitive to the metallicity of
the population eg Durrell etal 2002
In terms of galactic recycling the cluster has the eect of essentially shutting
down various recycling paths The ability for tidal tails to grow large tidal
dwarfs may be extremely limited as the cluster tides rapidly disperse the tidal
material The hot intracluster medium may also act to heat the tidal gas making
it dicult to form stars If any dwarfs or on smaller scales star clusters do
form in the tidal debris they will be rapidly stripped from their hosts perhaps
contributing to the populations of cluster dwarfs or intracluster globular clusters
The cluster will also shut down reaccretion from the tidal tails spawned
during a merger The combination of cluster tides and ram pressure stripping
from a hot intracluster medium will sweep clean the tidal debris and any low
density gas that might remain in the remnants For example the diuse HI disk
in the merger remnant Centaurus A Nicholson et al 1992 is unlikely to survive
any passage through the hot ICM of a dense cluster Models for forming S0
galaxies from mergers of galaxies followed by reformation or survival of a gaseous
disk eg Bekki 1998 or see the discussion in Schweizer 1998 seem dicult to
envision in the dense cluster environment However the S0 classication is a
very diverse one and the mechanism which gives rise to disky cluster S0s may
well be quite dierent than the merger mechanisms hypothesized to give rise to
bulge-dominated S0s in the eld environment
4 The Formation of Intracluster Light
As galaxies orbit in the cluster environment they are subject to tidal stripping
from a variety of sources  interactions with individual galaxies with groups of

galaxies or with the global cluster potential itself see eg the discussion in
Gnedin 2003 Over time this stripped starlight builds up the diuse intraclus-
ter light found in clusters of galaxies The properties of this ICL  its luminosity
morphological structure metallicity and kinematics  and their correlation with
cluster properties can help unravel the dynamical history of cluster collapse ac-
cretion and evolution To date theoretical work has largely focused on tidal
stripping from individual galaxies orbiting in an evolved cluster potential eg
Merritt 1983 Richstone  Malamuth 1983 Moore et al 1996 Calcaneo-Roldan
et al 2000 and ignored two important eects preprocessing in groups and
heating by substructure Gnedin 2003 Full cosmologically-motivated simula-
tions are needed to study the phenomenon in detail eg Dubinski et al 2001
Napolitano et al 2003 Mihos et al 2004
An example of these models is shown in Figure 5 from Mihos et al 2004
In this simulation we have excised a cluster from a at CDM cosmological
simulation and traced it back to z  2 At that point we identify dark matter
halos more massive than 1011 M which destined to end up in the z  0 cluster
and replace them with composite collisionless diskhalo galaxy models The
simulation is then run forward to the present day to examine the formation of
tidal debris and the ICL In essence this simulation follows the contribution
to the ICL from luminous galaxies rather than from the stripping of low mass
dwarfs In this simulation we see signicant kinematic and spatial substructure
at early times at late times much of this substructure has been well mixed
into a diuse intracluster light However at low surface brightnesses signicant
substructure remains even at z  0

the intracluster light in a simulated galaxy cluster Left panels show
the cluster at z  1 while the right panels show z  0 From Mihos

Detecting this ICL has proved dicult as at its brightest the ICL is only
1 of the brightness of the night sky Eorts to detect this ICL include deep
surface photometry to look for the diuse ICL eg Uson et al 1991 Bernstein
et al 1995 Gonzalez et al 2000 Feldmeier et al 2002 as well as imaging of
individual stars and planetary nebulae in nearby clusters Ferguson et al 1998
Feldmeier et al 1998 Arnaboldi et al 2002 Recently these surveys have begun
to reveal interesting substructure in the ICL often in the form of diuse arcs or
streaks of material from tidally stripped galaxies Trentham  Mobasher 1998
Gregg  West 1998 Calcaneo-Roldan et al 2000
To quantify the prevalence and properties of ICL as a function of cluster
properties we have begun a deep imaging survey of clusters using the KPNO
2m Feldmeier et al 2002 2004 We target a variety of clusters from cD-
dominated Bautz-Morgan Type I clusters to Type III clusters which are typied
by a more irregular distribution of galaxies Examples from this survey are
shown in Figure X The massive cD cluster Abell 1413 is marked by regular
distribution of diuse light well-t by a r
4 distribution over a large range of
radius with only a moderate excess at large radius and little substructure In
contrast Abell 1914 shows a variety of features a fan-like plume projecting
from the eastern clump of galaxies another diuse plume extending from the
galaxy group to the north of the cluster and a narrow stream extending to
the northwest from the cluster center We see similar behavior in other Abell
clusters we have surveyed

Although the sample size is small these results are consistent with the
expectations that substructure in the ICL is correlated with the dynamical state
of the cluster as a whole As clusters are assembled the ICL is built up though
the signicant tidal stripping that occurs during interactions within the accreting
groups and between galaxies and substructure within the cluster Does the total

measurements from a variety of sources Ciardullo et al this conference nd
only a weak dependence  the ICL fraction rises as expected from Type III
to Type II clusters but Type I cD-dominated clusters show fractionally less
ICL than do the Type IIs However the drop in the Type Is is likely due
to the diculty in distinguishing the ICL from the diuse envelope of the cD
galaxy itself indeed such distinction may not even be well motivated since
the cD envelope itself likely is formed from tidally stripped material Including
the luminosity of the cD envelope in the ICL budget would raise the fractional
amount of ICL in Type I clusters and bring the trend in line with expectations
from the dynamical models for generating ICL in clusters
