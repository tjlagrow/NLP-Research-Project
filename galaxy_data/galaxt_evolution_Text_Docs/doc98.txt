ABSTRACT
We model galaxy evolution in the 675m and 15m passbands of the ISO satellite
by combining models of galaxy evolution at optical wavelengths which are consistent
with the optical galaxy counts with observed spectral energy distributions in the
infra-red Our derived model is consistent with the local 12m galaxy luminosity
function from IRAS including the bright end if we place a small fraction  35 per
cent at z  0 of the models spiral galaxies in interacting pairs with mid-infra-red
luminosities enhanced by major starbursts
Source counts from deep ISO surveys in the 675m and 15m passbands signi-
cantly exceed non-evolving predictions We nd the number counts redshift distribu-
tions and the wide range of mid-infra-red to optical ux ratios of the detected galaxies
to be reasonably consistent with our evolving model
Our models suggest that the steep number count of 675m sources can be ex-
plained primarily by the evolving ES0 galaxies About one-third of 675m sources
do appear to be ES0s or early-type spirals consistent with this model but starburst
galaxies at 06  z  11 are more prominent in this passband than we expected In
the 15m passband the main contributors appear to be evolving star-forming spirals
and starbursting galaxy mergers as in our model Visibly interacting galaxies form
 31 per cent of the 15m detections to 200Jy and have high mid-infra-redoptical
ux ratios consistent with our models for major starbursts with high dust extinction
up to  18 mag in the rest-frame blue-band The numbers and high mean red-
shift 068  008 of merginginteracting galaxies detected in these ISO surveys are
only consistent with the local mid-infra-red luminosity function if the merger-triggered
starbursts undergo signicant luminosity evolution of  1  z2 to z  1 in addition
to the  1  z2 number evolution reecting the increase with redshift in the fraction
of merginginteracting galaxies as estimated from optical surveys

INTRODUCTION
With the Infrared Space Observatory ISO see eg Kessler
et al 1996 it has become possible to observe galaxies at
mid-infra-red MIR  525m wavelengths to redshifts
z  1 at which evolutionary eects become large The MIR
emission from galaxies is closely related to star-formation
activity and well correlated with bolometric luminosity
Spinoglio et al 1995 and much less dependent on the
dust content than the near-ultraviolet emission As the dust
extinction in individual star-forming galaxies ranges from
near-zero to EB  V   09 or  99 per cent absorption
in the near UV eg Calzetti Kinney and Storchi-Bergman
1994 observing in the MIR reduces a major source of un-
certainty in estimating star-formation rates and their evo-
ccid13 0000 RAS
lution However active galactic nuclei AGN are also very
luminous in the MIR and old stellar populations contribute
signicantly at the shorter MIR wavelengths so a wide range
of galaxies  not just starbursts  may be visible in MIR sur-
Three deep surveys have recently been carried out using
the ISOCAM instrument on ISO The rst two covered re-
spectively the Hubble Deep Field HDF area Goldschmidt
et al 1997 and a larger eld within the Canada-France Red-
shift Survey CFRS Flores et al 1998ab in two pass-
bands LW2 5    8m centred at 675m and LW3
12    18m centred at 15m the third a small area
in the Lockman Hole eld at 675m only Taniguchi et al
1997 Most detected MIR sources could be matched with
optically detected galaxies or AGN Spectroscopic data al-
N Roche and S A Eales
ready available for a high proportion of the galaxies on the
rst two survey elds indicated that ISO was detecting a
very diverse mixture of extreme starburst galaxies more
normal spirals ellipticals and Seyferts out to z  1
The deep ISO surveys found an increase with redshift in
the number of galaxies with high MIR luminosities Oliver et
al 1997 concluded that their source counts were in excess
of a non-evolving model at  3 consistent with the evolv-
ing model of Pearson and Rowan-Robinson 1996 at 15m
but steeper in slope than this model at 675m and consis-
tent with the evolving model of Franceschini et al 1994 in
both passbands However these models were based on lumi-
nosity functions and evolution derived from observations at
respectively 60 m and optical wavelengths and may not
fully represent the properties of galaxies in the MIR For
example the 60m12m luminosity ratio of galaxies tends
to increase with bolometric luminosity Rush et al 1993
Spinoglio et al 1995 so the MIR and 60m luminosity func-
tions may dier in shape  and any class of dust-reddened
starburst galaxies will of course be under-represented in op-
tical surveys
In this paper we compare these ISO surveys with mod-
els of our own considering MIRoptical ux ratios spectro-
scopic and morphological classications and redshift distri-
butions of the sources as well as number counts We aim to
improve on previous models by i ensuring that our models
MIR luminosity function at z  0 is consistent with the lo-
cal luminosity function at 12m rather than at 60m and
ii including a population of evolving starburst galaxies
with properties based on modelled and observed interact-
ing galaxies in addition to the full range of normal galaxies
with evolution consistent with optical observations

2 OBSERVATIONAL DATA
Our models of galaxies in the MIR Section 31 are based in
part on the tabulated spectral energy distributions SEDs
of Schmitt et al 1997 hereafter SKCS SKCS combine
observations from a large number of sources to give mean
low-resolution SEDs for ellipticals starburst galaxies and
Seyferts from radio to X-ray wavelengths We also make use
of i the Mazzei and de Zotti 1994 median ratio of 12 25
60 and 100 m uxes to the 22m ux for a larger sample
of ellipticals and S0s observed with IRAS ii the 58   
115m SED with additional measurements at 36m and
12m of the merging starburst spiral NGC6090 observed
with ISOPHOT on ISO Acosta-Pulido et al 1996 iii the
local 12m luminosity functions of non-Seyfert and Seyfert
galaxies derived by Rush et al 1993 from an IRAS survey
The models are compared with observations from three
deep ISO surveys The rst of these centred on the Hubble
Deep Field HDF imaged in the 675 m and 15m pass-
bands Goldschmidt et al 1997 Oliver et al 1997 reaching
completeness limits S675m  40Jy and S15m 
200Jy with a few detections at S675m  1540Jy
and S15m  100200Jy At 675m the survey covered
 625 arcmin2 with resolution F W HM  42 arcsec and
detected 27 sources at the 3 level of which one was iden-
tied as a star and 10 as galaxies of known redshift Mann
et al 1997 At 15m the survey covered  165 arcmin2
with F W HM  10 arcsec resolution detecting 22 sources
of which 10 were identied with galaxies of known redshift
A few redshifts listed by Mann et al 1997 are photometric
estimates here these are replaced by recent spectroscopic
redshifts from Aussel et al 1998
The second survey covered the larger 100 arcmin2 area
of the Canada-France Redshift Survey CFRS 141552
eld Flores et al 1998a 1998b reaching  100Jy at
675m and a similar limit to the HDF survey at 15m
At 675m there were a total of 59 3 detections of which 7
were identied as stars and 15 as galaxies of known redshift
At 15m the survey detected 78 sources of which two were
identied as stars and 22 as galaxies of known redshift Part
of the CRFS eld was imaged with the HST WFPC2 provid-
ing I-band morphological data for 16 of the 15m sources
In both these surveys the majority of sources with-
out redshifts appeared to correspond to faint galaxies of
unknown redshift although a signicant minority had no
visible optical counterparts Flores et al 1998a Aussel et
al 1998 The third survey Taniguchi et al 1997 cov-
ered a 3  3 arcmin area within the Lockman Hole eld
at 675m only for an even longer exposure time than the
HDF This survey detected 15 sources to the completeness
limit S675m  32Jy but at this point has no spectro-
scopic follow-up so for our purposes provides number counts
3 MODELLING GALAXIES IN THE MIR
31 Spectral Energy Distributions
We model evolving SEDs for dierent types of galaxy in the
MIR to optical range by combining the bc96 models of
evolving stellar populations eg Charlot et al 1996 with
observational data at longer wavelengths Our models as-
sume H0  50 km s1Mpc1 and q0  005 with galaxies
beginning to form stars with a Salpeter IMF 165 Gyr ago
Figure 1a shows the mean elliptical galaxy SED from
SKCS replaced at   10m by the more accurate much
larger sample Mazzei and de Zotti 1994 SEDs for IRAS
ellipticals and S0 galaxies This is compared with a bc96
model SED for an elliptical at z  0 with an exponentially
decreasing star-formation rate SFR of short timescale
SF R  05 Gyr and solar metallicity Z  002 The model
and observed SEDs are very similar at 01    10m but
at   10m log   1348 the bc96 model considering
only direct starlight predicts no ux whereas the observed
ES0s give some emission from infra-red cirrus the gen-
eral starlight absorbed and re-emitted by small dust grains
thinly distributed  with EB  V   001  throughout all
galaxies eg Rowan-Robinson 1992
Figure 1b shows the SKCS mean SED for 11 starburst
galaxies of dust extinction EB  V   04 replaced at
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
35    12m by the ISOPHOT spectrum of the starburst
galaxy NGC6090 Acosta-Pulido et al 1996 which being of
higher resolution shows the strong polycyclic aromatic hy-
drocarbon emission lines in the SEDs of star-forming galax-
ies at   627786 and 116 m These emission lines ap-
pear to be characteristic of star-forming galaxies and can
have large eects on a deep 15m survey Xu et al 1998
This SED is compared with a bc96 model for a galaxy
with a constant star-formation rate SFR Z  0008 metal-
licity and only EB  V   003 dust reddening observed
at an age of 1 Gyr The model and observed starburst SEDs
are similar from the K-band 22 m or log   1414 to
the 4000A break In the near UV the observed SED falls
below the model due to greater dust extinction in some of
the starburst galaxies the average extinction for the sam-
ple of 11 is EB  V   014 from Calzetti et al 1994
At   22m the observed SED shows a large excess over
the model primarily due to the absorption in dense dust
clouds and subsequent reemission in the MIR and far-infra-
red FIR of visible and UV light from newly formed massive
Clearly for star-forming galaxies the bc96 models are
only appropriate at   22m and an additional compo-
nent must be added at longer wavelengths We therefore
used the bc96 models to model the SEDs at   22m
and at longer wavelengths interpolated between the empiri-
cal SEDs shown in Figures 1a and 1b the rst representing
the MIRFIR emission from dust heated by an old stellar
population the second representing an actively star-forming
galaxy
311 Galaxy SEDs at   22m
At   22 m the bc96 models are used for all galaxies
with a range of SFR histories for dierent galaxy types The
SFRs in the elliptical and S0 models decrease exponentially
with SF R  05 and 10 Gyr respectively giving essentially
passive evolution which is consistent with the evolution of
ES0s in optical passbands eg Schade et al 1996 Roche
et al 1998a In spirals the SFR is assumed to rise and then
fall with time as tSF R05exptSF R with   40 55
and 80 Gyr for Sab Sbc and Scd types respectively The
Sab models also contain a bulge component 40 per cent of
their stars are formed as in the S0 model
These models predict similar colours and luminosity
evolution for the spirals as the more complicated spiral evo-
lution models of Roche et al 1998a and Roche and Eales
1998 As in these models we also include a class of late-
type Sdm starburst galaxies with an SED modelled as a
constant SFR model at an age of 1 Gyr giving the SED
shown on Figure 1b Solar Z  002 metallicity is as-
sumed for E S0 Sab and Sbc galaxies Z  0008 metallic-
ity for the Scd and Sdm-starburst models Dust extinction
modelled as described by Roche and Eales 1998 with the
dependence on wavelength from Mathis 1990 is added but
is small  01 mag in the blue-band for the above galaxy
types at the redshifts considered here
312 Galaxy SEDs at   22m
At   22m the modelled galaxy SED is an interpolation
between the empirical S0 and starburst SEDs The relative
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Modelling ISO Galaxy Counts
contributions of each are determined by the ratio of the near-
UV 2800A and K-band 22m luminosities in the bc96
model SED prior to the inclusion of any dust extinction
In the SKCS observed mean SEDs for ellipticals and
low-dust starbursts the L2800AL22 ratios are 0056
and 204 respectively The average dust reddening of the
galaxies in the starburst sample EB  V   014
corresponds from the extinction curve of Mathis 1990
to a 090 mag reddening of the L2800AL22 ratio
hence before dust extinction starburst galaxies would
have on average L2800AL22  468 For a modelled
galaxy SED a UV index U V  is dened as as U V 
L2800AL22 0056468 0056 giving U V  0 if
the L2800AL22 ratio before dust extinction is equal to
that in the SKCS elliptical SED and U V  1 if it is equal
to that of the SKCS starburst SED
At   22 m the SEDs of all galaxies apart from
ellipticals are modelled as U V SSB  1  U V SE where
SE is the SKCS elliptical SED at   10m and the Mazzei
and de Zotti 1994 S0 SED at longer wavelengths and SSB
the SKCS low-dust starburst SED replaced at 35   
12m by the Acosta-Pulido 1996 SED for NCG6090 These
two SEDs are normalized to give continuity with the bc96
model at 22m Ellipticals are modelled dierently from
S0s in that the Mazzei and de Zotti 1994 elliptical SED is
adopted at   10m
This interpolation results in the modelled MIRFIR
luminosity being
2800A luminosity with small
osets depending on
L22 eg L15  088L2800A  0025L22 The
L15mL2800A ratio is discussed further in Section 52
approximately proportional
313 ULIRGs and AGN
In addition to the normal galaxies described above a sig-
nicant fraction of FIR and MIR sources are Ultralumi-
nous Infra-red Galaxies ULIRGs eg Sanders and Mirabel
1996 The prominence of both ULIRGs and AGN in both
local and deeper FIRMIR surveys required that they be
included in our model
ULIRGs are generally found to be gas-rich galaxies in
a late stage of merging undergoing intense starbursts with
typical ages  10-100 Myr eg Genzel et al 1998 ULIRGs
might be well-described by a merger model of Mihos and
Hernquist 1996 in which two disk-plus-bulge galaxies of
similar mass produce a brief  50 Myr duration intense
starburst in the nal stages of merging
On the basis of the observed and modelled properties
we model the   22m SED using a bc96 constant SFR
model with solar metallicity seen at an age 005 Gyr The
  22m SED is derived from this as in Section 312
above We note that real galaxies representing the two types
of starburst galaxy in our model  merging L  L spirals
ULIRGs such as NGC6090 Acosta-Pulido et al 1996
and low-metallicity dwarf starburst galaxies eg Metcalfe et
al 1996  have been found to show very similar emission line
spectra at 6    12m Only in AGN-dominated ULIRGs
Genzel et al 1998 are the emission lines less pronounced
Hence our models use of the NGC6090 SED at 6   
12m should be a reasonable approximation for star-forming
galaxies in general
Despite their high content of massive stars nearby

ULIRGs generally have redder colours than normal spirals
Sanders et al 1988 Similarly the median I  K colour
of the detected 15m sources on the CFRS is 05 mag red-
der than that of the I-selected CFRS galaxies Flores et al
1998b These observations indicate that ULIRGs are gen-
erally dusty and on this basis we add high dust extinction
of EB  V   045 or 18 mag in the blue-band to our
merger-starburst model SED an amount chosen for consis-
tency with the colours of observed ULIRGs and also to t
the high MIRoptical ratios of many ISO sources Section
Finally our model includes the Active Galactic Nuclei
AGN Figure 1c shows the SKCS mean SED of a sam-
ple of 15 Seyfert 2 AGN which are strong emitters in the
MIR but without the prominent emission lines of starbursts
As QSOs Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies appear to have
similar SEDs in the 22    30m range Spinoglio et
al 1995 the SKCS mean SED is adopted for all AGN in
the model It is assumed that the AGN SED retains the
same shape with increasing redshift but evolves in normal-
ization to give the luminosity evolution described in Section
33 Figure 2 shows the modelled SEDs at z  0 of all the
types of galaxy in our model The merger-starburst SED is
shown with and without dust extinction illustrating that
the eects of dust are not signicant in the MIR but in-
creasingly reduce the ux bluewards of   1m with the
result that our modelled merger-starbursts have even higher
MIRoptical ratios than the Sdm-starbursts but relatively
red optical colours similar to Sab spirals

32 Luminosity Functions
The other principal ingredient of these models is the galaxy
luminosity function LF As the shape of the LF is likely
to depend on the wavelength of observation the most ap-
propriate local reference point may be the 12m LFs of low
redshift zmean  0013 galaxies and Seyferts derived by
Rush et al 1993 from an almost all-sky IRAS survey Fig-
ure 3 shows these LFs converted to H0  50 km s1Mpc1
as a dashed line for Seyferts and as the data points for non-
Seyfert galaxies
For the AGN our model adopts the Rush et al
1993 Seyfert LF shifted in luminosity according to
the L15L12 and L675L12 ratios from the SKCS

33 Galaxy Evolution in the MIR
The 12m LFs derived above are converted to the two
ISO passbands using L675L12 and L15L12 ra-
tios from the SEDs in Figure 2 Non-evolving k-corrections
and evolving ke-corrections shown of Figure 4 are de-
rived by integrating the SEDs from our models over the
two ISO passbands for a range of redshift In the ellipticals
and spiral models the stellar evolution in the bc96 mod-
els produces a corresponding evolution in the   22m
SEDs by changing U V and L22 The 1 Gyr starburst
SED is simply redshifted without evolution so the plotted
ke-correction the same as the k-correction The AGN ke-
correction is the k-correction combined with luminosity evo-
lution as L  1  z30 at all wavelengths to z  18 with L
remaining constant at z  18 in agreement with a number
of deep AGN surveys Page et al 1998
The merger-starburst galaxies are likely to evolve both
in comoving number density and luminosity The rate of
galaxy mergers is predicted eg Carlberg et al 1994 and
observed eg Infante de Mello and Menanteau 1996 Roche
and Eales 1998 to evolve as  1  z2 at least at moderate
redshifts We adopt fm  00351  z2 to z  18 fm
constant at z  18 where the luminosity density of AGN
and starburst galaxies appears to level out
Seyfert SED For non-AGN galaxies we convert optical
R-band LFs of the dierent Hubble types to 12m LFs
by applying the 104008 correction from characteristic abso-
lute magnitude M 
R to luminosity with the red-band ux
F R  2870 1004R Jy and multiplying by our modelled
F12mF R ratios Table 1 and 12m to obtain a
characteristic 12m luminosity F for each type of galaxy
As in Roche and Eales 1998 the red-band galaxy LFs
are those derived by Bromley et al 1998 from the Las
Campanas redshift survey divided into six spectral types
and corrected for incompleteness These LFs have steeper
faint-end slopes for bluer types of galaxy with   189 for
the bluest sixth class We modelled half of the galaxies in
the bluest class LF with the evolving Scd model these could
represent SdmIrr galaxies seen in a non-starburst phase
and grouped these with the spirals on Figure 3 and the other
half with the Sdm-starburst SED and plot these separately
On Figure 3 we see that rstly the steep faint-end slope
of the optically bluest galaxies can account very well for the
similarly steep faint end   18 of the 12m galaxy LF
Secondly at the bright end of the 12m LF the ES0 spiral
and Sdm-starburst LFs all cut o at too low a luminosity to
explain the numbers of IRAS-detected galaxies with L12 
10411 ergs s1
In order to t the bright end we introduce a popula-
tion of ULIRGs modelling its LF by assuming a fraction
fm of Sab Sbc and Scd galaxies to any any given time
be part of a merginginteractioning pair undergoing a star-
burst In ULIRGs the two nuclei are close with separations
from near-zero to  6h1 kpc Genzel et al 1998 corre-
sponding to  42 arcsec the ISO resolution at 675m
at all z  012 so it is assumed that all ULIRGs are de-
tected by ISO as single sources The mass of stars formed in
a merger starburst is less by about an order of magnitude
than the mass of the stars already present in each pre-merger
galaxy from Mihos and Hernquist 1996 but as the star-
burst population is much younger at the time of observation
its ratio of optical luminosity to mass will be about an or-
der of magnitude higher We therefore assume the merger
starburst to produce the same red-band luminosity as one
normal spiral of which some will be absorbed be absorbed
by the greater dust extinction in ULIRG which seems con-
sistent with the observed 27L median R-band luminosity
of ULIRGs Sanders and Mirabel 1996
On the basis of
this assumption
spiral by the F 12F R
the L12 of
the merger-starburst is modelled by multiplying LR
of one normal
ratio of
our merger-starburst model without dust extinction
F12F R  1341 giving an L12 which is higher that
of the spiral by factors 1213 531 and 443 for the Sab Sbc
and Scd models respectively The 12m LF of the starburst-
mergers is then modelled by assuming a fraction fm of spi-
rals to be reduced in number by a factor 2 but increased in
L12 by factors of 2 for the underlying two galaxies in the
ULIRG plus the modelled starburstspiral L12 ratios ie
1413 for Sabs 731 for Scds and and 643 for the Scds
With fm  0035 the combination of the R-band galaxy
LF with our modelled L12LR ratios ts the Rush et al
1993 observed LF reasonably well at the bright end and
over the full range of 12m luminosities Figure 3

Secondly the mean luminosity of starbursts in spiral
mergers is likely to increase with redshift due to a higher
content of gas at earlier epochs This increased gas density
will be be reected in the rate of steady star-formation in
normal spirals which are observed to increase in mean blue-
band surface brightness with redshift Schade et al 1995
Roche et al 1998a approximately as  1  z2 The lu-
minosity of merger-starbursts might evolve similarly but at
high redshifts may reach an upper limit  Weedman et al
1998 nd that starbursts at 223  z  343 on the HDF
have on average 4 times the UV surface brightness of their
local counterparts On the basis of these observations we
assume L  1  z2 for the starburst-merger galaxies at all
wavelengths to z  1 with L constant at z  1
On Figure 4 for our models in the in the 675m band
the k-correction of early-type galaxies is very negative ie
a brightening with redshift due to the steep rise in the
spectrum from the MIR where luminosity is low due to the
absence of star-formation to the NIR where there is strong
emission from the the old red stars The bluest galaxies suf-
fer a k-correction dimming as the observed passband shifts
away from the PAH emission features and for the same rea-
son the evolution of spirals produces only a small brighten-
ing at 675m so the ES0 galaxies are expected to become
more prominent on going faintwards
In the 15m passband the k-corrections of dierent
galaxy types are more similar and the eects of the evo-
lution of the spirals are much more visible especially at
05  z  12 where the PAH emission features are red-
shifted into this passband Star-forming galaxies should
therefore continue to dominate at faint uxes
Our non-evolving model then incorporates the k-
corrections on Figure 4 with fm constant and evolving
model uses the ke-corrections on Figure 4 with fm evolving
as described above
4 COMPARISON OF MODELS WITH
OBSERVATIONS
41 ISO Source Counts
The dierential ISO source counts were obtained i for the
CFRS eld from Flores et al 1998a 1998b by counting the
listed  3 detections in 05 mag log S  02 bins ex-
cluding the few identied as stars and dividing by the total
area 100 arcmin2 and ii for the Lockman Hole eld from
the source list of Taniguchi et al 1997 with its total area

suggest an oset in the ux calibrations Aussel et al 1998
nd some evidence for this We can only assume the true
count lies about mid-way between the two measurements
In the non-evolving model in the 675m band Fig-
ure 5 the ES0 galaxies have a steeper number count than
other sources due to their very negative k-correction but
this is insucient to t the observed count In both pass-
bands non-evolving models underpredict the source counts

The addition of evolution further steepens the 675m
counts of ES0 galaxies to   09 where   dlog N

These evolving ES0s steepen the predicted count of all
sources at log S  42 from   059 with no ES0s
to   074 which is consistent with the steep observed
count Figure 7 At 15m evolution increases the count of
spirals and mergers in particular Figure 8 steepening the
counts for all source types at log S  37 from   042

evolving model appears reasonably consistent with the the
observed source counts considering the large error bars and
the additional uncertainties mentioned above

F 675F 081 and F 15F 081 as a function of red-
shift together with the spectral andor morphological clas-
sications of the survey authors can give an indication of
the range of galaxy types represented
Figures 10 and 11 show respectively observer-frame
F 675F 081 and F 15F 081 ratios of the ISO
sources with redshifts compared to our evolving galaxy
models The distribution of ux ratios suggests that the
range of galaxy types represented in the ISO surveys is com-
parable to the full range in our model
Many 675m sources do seem to be normal galax-
ies 926 of those with redshifts have F 675F 081 ratios
consistent with our ES0 or spiral models and two more
with the Sdm-starburst model and of 10 of sources on the
HDF 4 appeared to be normal spirals and 2 to be ellipti-
cals However 1426 sources have high F 675F 081 ra-
tios consistent only with the AGN or the merger-starburst
models a  3 excess over the 23 per cent fraction of these
types in our evolving model at S675m  100Jy A to-
tal of 724 have optical spectra indicating the presence of
AGN slightly more than but consistent with the AGN frac-
tion in the model 15 per cent at 100Jy Three out of the
10 675m sources on the HDF are visibly interacting and
also have F 675F 081 ratios consistent with the merger-
starburst model
The 15m sample is even more dominated by star-
burst galaxies Of 32 sources with redshifts only one has
a F 15F 081 ratio consistent with a non-star-forming
galaxy  and it is a spectroscopically identied QSO A fur-
ther 532 have ux ratios consistent with normal spirals
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
at z  04  and 832 with being either spirals or Sdm-
starburst galaxies at 04  z  10 This seems consis-
tent with our evolving model in which only 15 per cent
of S15m  100Jy sources are ES0s but 41 per cent
are spirals and 11 per cent are Sdm-starbursts The ma-
jority of the 15m sources including all ve of the known
interacting galaxies have high ux ratios covering the range
from the Sdm-starburst to the merger-starburst and AGN
models suggesting a diverse mixture of rapidly star-forming
galaxies with a wide range of dust extinctions
Flores et al 1998b nd 6 of the 16 CFRS eld sources
observed with the HST to be interacting galaxies as are 210
of the 15m sources on the HDF giving a total of a 31 
11 per cent fraction of starburst-merger galaxies consistent
with our evolving model in which starburst-mergers make up
26 per cent of S15m  200Jy sources If the number and
LF of starburst-merger galaxies did not evolve but remained
at that needed to t the local 12m LF Section 32 Fig 3
their numbers at this limit would be an order of magnitude
lower 49 deg2 compared to 507 deg2 and with 1  z2
density evolution but no luminosity evolution they would
be a factor of four lower 131 deg2
Lastly the 432 fraction of 15m sources identied on
the basis of optical spectra as Seyferts or QSOs is consistent
with the evolving model prediction of 21 per cent
In summary the evolving model in addition to tting
the ISO source counts is consistent with observed fractions
of dierent source types with the exception that there ap-
pear to be about twice as many starburst galaxies in the
675m surveys as predicted In the 15m passband the ob-
served  31 percent fraction of starbursting merger galaxies
is consistent with our evolving model and greatly exceeds
that expected with no evolution

43 Source Redshift Distributions
Finally the redshift distributions of the sources can be
compared with the models although with relatively poor
statisics Figure 12 shows the observed N z for the 675m
sources with redshifts with the CFRS and HDF N z shown
separately as their ux ranges are separate and the 15m
sources with the CFRS and HDF results combined as the
ux limits are similar We assume that the spectroscopi-
cally identied sources are an unbiased sample of all detected
sources and so correct for the incompleteness of the spec-
troscopy by multiplying each N z by the ratio of the total
number of non-stellar detections to the number with red-
shifts The observations are compared with the non-evolving
and evolving models For the 15m survey the models are
also shown for the starburst-merger galaxies separately 
with evolution they make up the majority of the detections
at 06  z  11
In the 675m band the observed N z with zmean 
062  010 and 064  010 for 100Jy and 40Jy limits
is much more extended than the non-evolving model giv-
ing zmean  021 and 038 respectively and more consistent
with the evolving models zmean  042 and 078 There
may be some excess at 06  z  11 over even the evolv-
ing model apparently Figure 10 made up of star-forming
galaxies with high F 675F 081 ratios at least equal to
the starburst-merger model see Section 52
In the 15m band the observed mean redshift of
062  007 at a 200Jy limit is much more consistent by
 4 with the evolving zmean  049 than the non-
evolving model zmean  018 and the shape of N z at
04  z  10 is similar to the at extended tail of the
evolving model  presumably this is the result of the contri-
bution from PAH emission lines over this redshift range
The six identied merginginteracting galaxies at this
limit have zmean  068  008 consistent with the zmean 
072 predicted by our model for merger-starburst galaxies
undrgoing both density and luminosity evolution Models
with the same z  0 LF with no evolution and with den-
sity evolution only give respectively zmean  035 and
zmean  046 underpredicting the mean redshift of merg-
inginteracting galaxies as well as the numbers detected
Finally in both passbands there are a few low-redshift
z  03 sources in numbers consistent with the steep faint-
end slope of the model LF
5 DISCUSSION
51 The Content of the Deep ISO Surveys
We have combined observed infra-red SEDs of star-forming
and passive galaxies with galaxy evolution models which
also t the galaxy number counts in the optical passbands to
predict the luminosities and evolution of the dierent galaxy
types in the MIR The model applied to the local R-band
LF from the Las Campanas survey appears consistent with
the local galaxy 12m LF although to t the bright end it is
necessary for a small proportion of galaxies to have enhanced
MIRoptical luminosity ratios  this was represented in our
model by placing 35 per cent of spirals into merging or
interacting pairs with tidally-triggered starbursts of R-band
luminosity before dust extinction equal to that of each pre-
merger galaxy The steep faint end   18 of the Rush
et al 1993 LF corresponded to that of the bluest type
of galaxy in optical surveys suggesting that these late-type
dwarf galaxies will make up most of the lower redshift MIR
sources
The deep ISO counts signicantly  3 exceed non-
evolving predictions as previously concluded by Oliver et
al 1997 and are much more consistent with our evolving
model Secondly the redshift distributions of indentied ISO
sources are much more extended than the non-evolving mod-
els indicating that their high number counts result primar-
ily from luminosity evolution as in our model rather than
density evolution We interpret the success of this evolving
model in the MIR as indicating that deep MIR and optical
surveys trace the same star-formation history  primarily
that of the various classes of spiral However the MIR sur-
veys also show contributions from other galaxy types
i In our model the steepness of the 675m source
counts is accounted for by a signicant contribution from
ES0 galaxies eg 29 per cent of sources to 100Jy 44
per cent to 40Jy which with a combination of a strong
k-correction brightening with passive evolution consistent
with the evolution of ellipticals in the optical passbands
eg Schade et al 1996 Roche et al 1998a show a
very steep   09 number count The distribution of
F 675F 081 ratios Fig 10 is consistent with  13
of the 675m sources being ES0s and therefore supports
this interpretation of the steep counts
ii Secondly the  31 per cent of the 15m sources
to 200Jy which were visibly interacting pairs had high
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
MIRoptical ux ratios which we interpret as indicating ma-
jor starbursts with signicant dust extinction of up to  18
mag in the rest-frame blue
There is already evidence from optical and K-band ob-
servations that the fraction of merging and interacting galax-
ies increases with redshift approximately as 1z2 at least
at moderate redshifts eg Infante et al 1995 Roche and
Eales 1998 Roche et al 1998b At z  0 the number den-
sity and MIR luminosity of the starburst-merger population
are constrained by the bright end of the Rush et al 1993
LF When compared with a model which t this local LF
the numbers and relatively high mean redshift 068  008
of starburst-mergers in the deep MIR surveys required lumi-
nosity evolution in addition to the 1z2 increase in comov-
ing number density expected from the evolving merger rate
More deep MIR data will be needed to accurately determine
this rate of luminosity evolution but the observations ap-
peared well-tted by L  1  z2 to z  1 similar to the
surface brightness evolution of normal spirals as expected
if the change with redshift in the typical luminosity of the
merger-triggered starbursts traces the evolving gas content
of the pre-merger spirals
iii Thirdly some  20 per cent of ISO sources
are Seyferts or QSOs as expected from the already well-
determined LF Rush et al 1993 and evolution eg Page
et al 1998 of this type of source
52 Comparison of MIR Models
We believe that the evolving model considered here al-
though based on limited observational data and many ap-
proxmations improves on previous models of galaxy evo-
lution in the MIR in its consistency with both deep opti-
cal surveys and the 12m LF of local galaxies Oliver et
al 1997 compare their counts with two models one from
Pearson and Rowan-Robinson PRR 1997 and one from
Franceschini et al AF 1994 We discuss these two models
in turn
The PRR model rstly contains only two galaxy types
plus AGN cirrus galaxies spirals which undergo lit-
tle evolution and starburst galaxies which evolve as L 
1  z31 However we nd that evolving ES0 galaxies are
important in accounting for the steep slope of the 675m
counts ES0s are not represented in the PRR model which
consequently predicts too shallow a count slope in the
675m passband and was rejected by Oliver et al 1997
Secondly the relations between SFR and luminosity
in the PRR model correspond to L15  057L2800A
whereas in our model based on the SKCS mean SEDs
L15  088L2800A The dierence appears to be related
to the L15L60 ratio which is 028 in PRR and 045 in
our models IRAS observations Spinoglio et al 1995 in-
dicate a typical ux ratio of logF60F12  11 for normal
star-forming galaxies which corresponds to F   157 and
L15L60  045 as in our model The discrepancy be-
tween the high Rowan-Robinson et al 1997 estimates of
the SFRs in individual ISO galaxies and the results of Flo-
res et al 1998b and the global SFRs from UV and FIR
surveys also suggest they are using a model with too little
of the total ux in the MIR range
Thirdly PRR model the MIR galaxy LF using a shifted
60m LF but as the L60L12 ratio of galaxies tends
ccid13 0000 RAS MNRAS 000 000000
Modelling ISO Galaxy Counts
Fourthly
to increase with bolometric luminosity Rush et al 1993
Spinoglio et al 1995 the true galaxy LF in the MIR will
be steeper than at 60m In particular PRR use a faint-end
slope   127 for the starburst galaxies whereas MIR and
optical observations give   18
in the PRR model most of the evolution
is concentrated into the starburst galaxies which number
about one-seventh of the total whereas in our model the
luminosity evolution is distributed more evenly amongst
ES0s spirals and merger-starbursts allowing the counts to
be tted with a more moderate rate of evolution The lat-
ter seems more consistent with optical evidence that ES0s
early-type and late-type spirals all have similar rates of lu-
minosity and surface brightness evolution out to z  1 eg
Schade et al 1995 1996 Roche et al 1998a Glazebrook
et al 1998 Elbaz et al 1998 claim that a steepening of
the counts at S15m  2 mJy supports an even more
extreme division into non-evolving galaxies and starburst
galaxies evolving almost as 1  z6 However the reported
steepening occurs at exactly the ux where there is a slight
steepening of the counts in our evolving model as redshifted
emission lines begin to enter this passband and is based on
a single eld where statistical errors andor clustering might
have exaggerated the change in slope
The AF model includes ES0 galaxies with very sim-
ilar SEDs and evolution as our model and so does t the
steep 675m counts The AF model is much more similar to
ours in that it includes the full range of Hubble types with
evolution derived from evolving SFRs and it appears more
consistent with the deep NIR and optical galaxy counts than
PRR see the AF and PRR papers The AF model includes
a starburst population with only slight evolution and a steep
LF similar to our models Sdm-starbursts and predicts the
ratio of starburst to normal spiral galaxies to decrease on
going faintwards with only an 18 per cent fraction of star-
burst galaxies at S15m  250Jy However observations
suggest that the ratio of peculiar to spiral morphologies in
ISO surveys increases with redshift Elbaz et al 1998 and
the high F 15F 081 ratios Fig 11 of many sources indi-
cate a starburst galaxy fraction closer to 50 per cent These
discrepancies can be resolved simply by adding as we have
done a second population of starburst galaxies  spirals un-
dergoing major mergers with a more rapidly evolving LF
The inclusion of density evolution corresponding to a
1  z2 merger rate reduces the luminosity evolution re-
quired for the merger-starbursts from that of AGN or greater
eg Elbaz et al 1998 to a rate similar to their spiral pro-
genitors which is surely more easily explained physically
Luminosity evolution will have a greater eect on mean red-
shift relative to its eect on the number counts than den-
sity evolution hence our models consistency with the mean
redshift of 6 interacting galaxies Section 43 supports the
adopted balance of these two processes but clearly a much
larger sample is needed to conrm this
At 675m our model may underpredict the number and
F 675F 081 ratio Fig 12 of starburst galaxies at 05 
z  10 This discrepancy may be the result of our simple
interpolation of the starburst SEDs in the 36    58m
range where there is little data available The SED of the
nearby Circinus galaxy Moorwood et al 1996 although
noisy in this range suggests the presence of emission features
at   40m which would add to the 675m uxes from
N Roche and S A Eales
starburst galaxies at these redshifts  another possibility is
that many of these starburst galaxies have an additional
contribution to the ux at this wavelength from obscured
53 Future Prospects
Considering future MIR observations surveys at  15m
on account of the relatively clean sensitivity to star-
formation should be particularly useful for studying various
types of starburst galaxy including the merging spirals and
Sdm galaxies of our model comparing their properties such
as dust extinction and determining their evolution to z  1
beyond which k-corrections become unfavourable This red-
shift has already been reached at 200Jy However to in-
terpret the results it is important that sources are carefully
classied by spectroscopy high-resolution imaging etc to
study the rate and type of evolution of each type of galaxy
Hence at this wavelength it is probably most useful for fu-
ture surveys to be aimed at acquiring much larger source
samples to similar  02mJy limits this should be achieved
by the forthcoming WIRE Deep Survey
The 675m passband may be less useful until galaxy
SEDs at  36m are better determined thereafter it may
be particularly suited to studying the evolution of ES0s and
disk-plus-bulge spirals As these types are expected to evolve
most rapidly at z  1 and as their 675m k-correction be-
comes increasingly favourable to z  4 it might be most
useful in this passband to survey small elds to the great-
est possible depths ie the confusion limit in the hope of
reaching the Lyman break galaxies at 25  z  40 At
these redshifts 675m corresponds approximately to the
rest-frame K-band and uxes will aid our understanding of
these objects by giving an indication of the mass of stars
already formed rather than the star-formation rate
Our model which assumes all ES0s are formed at z 
4 predicts that Lyman break ES0s will suddenly appear
at the level of one per HDF-size eld at S675m  35Jy
and therefore that two or three may already have been de-
tected on the Lockman Hole eld of Taniguchi et al 1998
However if a high proportion of ES0s formed from merg-
ers at z  25 or did not form the bulk of their stars until
z  25 the numbers andor uxes of Lyman break ES0s
will be correspondingly reduced
