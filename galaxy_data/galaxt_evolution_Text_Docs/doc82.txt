Abstract
At the present epoch clusters of galaxies are known to be a hostile environment
for emission-line galaxies which are more commonly found in low density re-
gions outside of clusters In contrast going to higher redshifts the population
of emission-line galaxies in clusters becomes progressively more conspicuous
and large numbers of star-forming late-type galaxies are observed I present an
overview of the observational ndings and the theoretical expectations regard-
ing the evolution of emission-line galaxies in dense environments discussing
the properties of these galaxies and the current evidence for environmental in-
uences on their evolution

Introduction
This review focuses on galaxies with emission lines in their optical spectra
In the great majority of cases at least in clusters an emission-line galaxy can
be assumed to be currently forming stars1 thus the subject of this contribu-
tion is essentially the whole population of cluster galaxies with ongoing star
formation at any given epoch One of the major goals of current studies of
galaxy formation and evolution is to understand when each galaxy formed or
will form its stars and why Naturally star-forming galaxies are at the heart
of this investigative effort Knowing their frequency and their evolution as a
function of the environment is fundamental to trace the evolution of the star
formation activity with redshift and to start gaining insight on the processes
that regulate such activity
This is an area of research that really encompasses many scales of the
Universe from the star formation on the scale of a single star-forming region
within a galaxy to the integrated properties on a galaxy scale to a galaxy-
cluster scale and to the evolution of the global star formation history on a
cosmic scale I will briey touch upon each of these scales and I will focus
on the following main questions how many emission line galaxies are there in
clusters at different redshifts What are their properties star formation rates
Hubble types gas content What is their fate How do they evolve and why
And nally what can they teach us about galaxy formation and evolution in
general
High redshift
Star formation activity
At any given redshift the properties of cluster galaxies display a large clus-
ter to cluster variance The average galaxy in the Coma cluster looks quite
different from the average galaxy in the Virgo cluster the rst cluster being
dominated by passively evolving early-type galaxies and the second one hav-
ing a larger population of star-forming spirals Moreover clusters of galaxies
far from being closed boxes continuously form and evolve accreting single
galaxies pairs groups or merging with other clusters The galaxy content of
a cluster thus changes with redshift Keeping these two things in mind it is
possible to look for evolutionary trends with redshift
Historically the rst evidence for a higher incidence of star-forming galax-
ies in distant clusters compared to nearby clusters came from photometric stud-
ies Butcher  Oemler 1978 1984 Ellingson et al 2001 Kodama  Bower
2001 Spectroscopy is of course the most direct way to identify emissionline
galaxies For distant galaxies the H line is redshifted at optical wavelengths
that are severely affected by sky or in the near-IR thus the feature most com-
monly used is the Oii3727 line
In the MORPHS sample of 10 clusters at z  04  05 the fraction of
emissionline galaxies is  30 for galaxies brighter than MV  19 
5log h1 Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 In the CNOC cluster
sample at an average redshift z  03 this fraction is about 25 Balogh et al
1999 This incidence is much higher than it is observed in similarly rich clus-
ters at z  0 Dressler Thompson  Shectman 1988 Signicant numbers of
emission-line galaxies have been reported in virtually all spectroscopic surveys
of distant clusters Couch  Sharples 1987 Fisher et al 1998 Postman et al
1998 2001
The importance of the Oii emission can also be assessed from cluster
composite spectra that are obtained summing up the light from all galaxies
in a given cluster to produce a sort of cluster integrated spectrum Fig 1
Dressler et al 2004 As expected the strength of Oii in these composite
spectra displays a large clustertocluster variation at any redshift but there is
a tendency for the z  05 clusters to have on average a stronger composite
EWOii than the clusters at z  0
If numerous observations indicate that emissionline galaxies were more
prominent in clusters in the past than today and if these results are unsurprising
given the evolution with z of the star formation activity in the general eld

quantifying this evolution in clusters has proved to be very hard The fact
that the emissionline incidence varies strongly from a cluster to another at
all redshifts and the relatively small samples of clusters studied in detail at
different redshifts have so far hindered our progress in measuring how the
fraction of emissionline galaxies evolves with redshift as a function of the
cluster properties
Discriminating between cosmic evolution and clustertocluster variance is
a problem also for H clusterwide studies Using narrowband imaging or
multiplex multislit capabilities a handful of clusters have been studied to date
at z  02 Couch et al 2001 Balogh et al 2002a Finn et al 2004 and
submitted Kodama et al 2004 Umeda et al 2004 These studies have con-
rmed that the fraction of emissionline Hdetected in this case galaxies
is lower in clusters than in the eld at similar redshifts and have shown that
the bright end of the H luminosity function does not seem to depend strongly
on environment As shown in Fig 2 the number of clusters studied is still
insufcient to pin down the star formation rate SFR per unit of cluster mass
as a function of redshift AND of global cluster properties such as the cluster
velocity dispersion

A word of caution is compulsory when using emissionlines and assuming
they provide an unbiased view of the evolution of the star formation activity
in cluster galaxies There are several indications that dust extinction is in fact
important and strongly distorts our view of the star formation activity in at
least some cluster galaxies Evidence for dust arises from optical spectroscopy
itself which nds many dusty starbursting or starforming galaxies with rel-
atively weak emissionlines both in distant clusters and in the eld at similar
redshifts Poggianti et al 1999 Shioya et al 2000 Poggianti et al 2001
Bekki et al 2001 The radiocontinuum detection of galaxies with no optical
emission lines Smail et al 1999 Miller  Owen 2002 and mid-IR estimates
of the star formation rate Duc et al 2002 Coia et al 2004 submitted Biviano
et al 2004 indicate that even the majority or all of the star formation activity
of some cluster galaxies can be obscured at optical wavelengths Whether tak-
ing into account dust obscuration changes signicantly the evolutionary picture
inferred from emission lines is still a critical open question
Finally precious informations about emissionline galaxies can be obtained
from absorptionline spectra In distant clusters the presence of galaxies with
strong Balmer lines in absorption in their spectra and no emission lines testi-
es that these are post-starburstpost-starforming galaxies observed soon after
Emission line galaxies in clusters
their star formation activity was interrupted and observed within 1-15 Gyr
from the halting Dressler  Gunn 1983 Couch  Sharples 1987 see Pog-
gianti 2004 for a review These galaxies have been found to be proportion-
ally more numerous in distant clusters than in the eld at comparable redshifts
Dressler et al 1999 Poggianti et al 1999 Tran et al 2003 2004  Their
spectral characteristics and their different frequency as a function of the envi-
ronment are a strong indication for a truncation of the star formation activity
related to the dense environment
Galaxy morphologies
In this section I summarize the results concerning the morphologies of emission-
line galaxies in distant clusters obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary
Camera 2 At the time of writing highquality data of distant clusters have
been obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys by several groups and
results should appear soon Desai et al in prep Postman et al in prep
The HST images have revealed the presence of large numbers of spiral
galaxies in all distant clusters observed Comparing HST morphologies and
spectroscopy it has been shown that emissionline galaxies in distant clusters
are for the great majority spirals Dressler et al 1999 The viceversa is not
always true several of the cluster spirals in fact do not display any emission
line in their spectra and both their spectra and their colors indicate a lack of
current star formation activity Poggianti et al 1999 Couch et al 2001 Goto
et al 2003
These passive spirals might be an intermediate stage when starforming
spirals are being transformed into passive S0 galaxies A strong reason to
believe that a signicant fraction of the spirals in distant clusters evolve into
S0s comes from the evolution of the Morphology-Density MD relation The
MD relation is the observed correlation between the frequency of the various
Hubble types and the local galaxy density normally dened as the projected
number density of galaxies within an area including its closest neighbours In
clusters in the local Universe the existence of this relation has been known for
a long time ellipticals are frequent in high density regions while the fraction
of spirals is high in low density regions Oemler 1974 Dressler et al 1980
At z  04  05 an MD relation is already present at least in concentrated
clusters but it is quantitatively different from the relation at z  0 the frac-
tion of S0 galaxies at z  05 is much lower at all densities than in clusters
at z  0 Dressler et al 1997 The fraction of S0s in clusters appears to
increase towards lower redshifts while the proportion of spirals correspond-
ingly decreases Dressler et al 1997 Fasano et al 2000 Interestingly el-
lipticals are already as abundant at z  05 as at z  0 Adopting a more
conservative distinction between early-type EsS0s and late-type spirals
galaxies a similar evolution is found with the early-type fraction decreasing
at higher redshifts van Dokkum et al 2000 Lubin et al 2002 First results at
z  07  13 seem to indicate that between z  05 and z  1 what changes
in the MD relation is only the occurrence of early-type galaxies in the very
highest density regions Smith et al 2004
Alltogether the ndings described in this and the previous section suggest
that many galaxies have stopped forming stars in clusters quite recently as
a consequence of environmental conditions switching off their star formation
activity and that many galaxies have morphologically evolved from late to
early type galaxies What can be the causecauses for these changes
Physical processes
The physical mechanisms that are usually considered when trying to assess
the inuence of the environment on galaxy evolution can be grouped in four
main families
1 Mergers and strong galaxy-galaxy interactions Toomre  Toomre 1972
Hernquist  Barnes 1991 see Mihos 2004 for a review These are most
efcient when the relative velocities between the galaxies are low thus
are expected to be especially efcient in galaxy groups
2 Tidal forces due to the cumulative effect of many weaker encounters
also known as harassment Richstone 1976 Moore et al 1998
These are expected to be especially important in clusters and particu-
larly on smaller  lower mass galaxies
3 Gas stripping - Interactions between the galaxy and the inter-galactic
medium IGM Gunn  Gott 1972 Quilis et al 2000 The interstellar
medium of a galaxy can be stripped via various mechanisms including
viscous stripping thermal evaporation and  the most famous member
of this family  ram pressure stripping Ram pressure can be efcient
when the IGM gas density is high and the relative velocity between the
galaxy and the IGM is high and such conditions are expected to be met
especially in the very central regions of cluster cores
4 Strangulation also known as starvation or suffocation Larson Tinsley
 Caldwell 1980 Bower  Balogh 2004 Assuming galaxies possess
an envelope of hot gas that can cool and feed the disk with fuel for star
formation the removal of such reservoir of gas is destined to inhibit
further activity once the disk gas is exhausted In semi-analytic models
for example the gas halo is assumed to be removed when a galaxy enters
as satellite in a more massive dark matter halo
Emission line galaxies in clusters
Note that while stripping gas from the disk induces a truncation of the star
formation activity on a short timescale  107 yrs strangulation is expected to
affect a galaxy star formation history on a long timescale  1 Gyr provoking
a slowly declining activity which consumes the disk gas after the supply of
cooling gas has been removed
The former two of these families of processes affect the galaxy structure
thus morphology in a direct way the merger of two spirals can produce an
elliptical galaxy and repeated tidal encounters can change a latetype into an
early-type galaxy The latter two families instead act on the gas content of
galaxies hence their star formation activity and can modify their morpholo-
gies in an indirect way once star formation is halted in a disk this can fade
signicantly the bulge-to-disk relative importance can change and the galaxy
appearance and morphology can appear signicantly modied
Low redshift
Numerous excellent works have been carried out on a single cluster or sam-
ples of clusters in the local Universe Summarizing them is beyond the scope
of this paper and the reader can nd a comprehensive review in Gavazzi 
Boselli in prep I have chosen to mention two low-redshift results here to
compare and contrast them with the results at higher redshifts the observed
trends of star formation with local environment and the gasSF distribution
within galaxies
Trends of star formation with local environment
It has been known for a long time that in the nearby Universe also the aver-
age star formation activity correlates with the local density in higher density
regions the mean star formation rate per galaxy is lower This is not surpris-
ing given the existence of the MD relation the highest density regions have
proportionally more early-type galaxies devoid of current star formation
Interestingly the correlation between mean SF and local density extends to
very low local densities comparable to those found at the virial radius of clus-
ters and such a correlation exists also outside of clusters Lewis et al 2002
Gomez et al 2003 Again this seems to parallel the fact that an MD relation
is probably existing in all environments and it has been observed in clusters of
all types Dressler et al 1980 and groups Postman  Geller 1984  though
the MD relation is not the same in all environments eg in concentrated vs ir-
regular high- vs low- LX clusters Dressler et al 1980 Balogh et al 2002b
A variation in the mean SFgalaxy with density can be due either to a differ-
ence in the fraction of star-forming galaxies or in the star formation rates of
the star-forming galaxies or a combination of both In a recent paper Balogh
et al 2004a have shown that the distribution of H equivalent widths EW
in star-forming galaxies does not depend strongly on the local density while
the fraction of star-forming galaxies is a steep function of the local density in
all environments Again a dependence on the global environment is observed
in the sense that at a given local density the fraction of emission-line galaxies
is slightly lower in environments with high density on large scales  5 Mpc
but see Kauffmann et al 2004 for an opposite result
The fact that a relation between star formation and density is observed also
outside of clusters has often been interpreted as a sign that the environment
starts affecting the star formation activity of galaxies provoking a decline in
star formation in galaxies that if isolated would continue forming stars at rel-
atively low densities when a galaxy becomes part of a group Personally I
believe the existence of such a correlation is more probably the result of a
correlation between initial conditions galaxy mass andor local environment
very early on at the time the rst stars formed in galaxies and type of galaxy
formed The exact shape of the correlation instead is probably inuenced by
transformations happening in galaxies when they enter a different environment
Gas content and gasSF distribution within galaxies
In order to understand what happens to galaxies in clusters two crucial
pieces of information are 1 the gas content of cluster galaxies and 2 the spatial
distribution of the gas and of the star formation activity within each galaxy
It has been several years since it became evident that many spirals in clusters
are decient in HI gas compared to similar galaxies in the eld Giovanelli 
Haynes 1985 Cayatte et al 1990 see van Gorkom 2004 for a review Most
but not all of the HI decient spirals are found at small distances from the
cluster centre In the central regions of clusters the sizes of the HI disks are
smaller than the optical disks and a spatial displacement between the HI and
the optical occurs in several cases Bravo-Alfaro et al 2000 The fraction
of HIdecient spirals increases going towards the cluster centre and a corre-
lation is observed between deciency and orbital parameters more decient
galaxies tend to be on radial orbits Solanes et al 2001
All of these ndings strongly suggest that ram pressure stripping or at least
gas stripping in general plays an important role see also Bravo-Alfaro and
Solanes contributions in these proceedings On the other hand the work from
Solanes et al 2001 has unexpectedly shown that the HI deciency is ob-
served out to 2 Abell radii This result has raised the question whether the
origin of the HI deciency in the cluster outskirts can be consistent with the
ram pressure scenario and whether can be simply due to effects such as large
distance errors or rebounding at large clustercentric distances of galaxies that
have gone through the cluster center Balogh Navarro  Morris 2000 Mamon
et al 2004 Moore et al 2004 Sanchis et al 2004
Emission line galaxies in clusters

in different classes according to their H distribution The rst two panels show proles that
can be considered normal reproduced also in other panels Truncated anemic enhanced
classes are shown in all the other panels
Recent works have yielded a census of the spatial distribution of the star for-
mation as observed in H emission within cluster galaxies These works have
shown that the majority of the cluster galaxies have peculiar H morphologies
compared to eld galaxies Moss  Whittle 1993 2000 Koopmann  Ken-
ney 2004 Vogt et al 2004 More than half of the spirals in the Virgo cluster
for example have H radial proles truncated from a certain radius on while
others have H suppressed throughout the disk and in some cases enhanced
Fig 3 Koopmann  Kenney 2004 On a sample of 18 nearby clusters sim-
ilar classes of objects are observed spirals with truncated H emission and
HI gas on the leading edge of the disk spirals stripped of their HI with their
star formation conned to the inner regions and quenched spirals in which
the star formation is suppressed throughout the disk Vogt et al 2004 From
these works gas stripping appears a very important factor in determining both
the gas content and the star formation activity of cluster spirals though tidal
effects are also found to be signicant Moss  Whittle 2000 Koopmann 
Kenney 2004 Spirals in clusters thus appear to be heavily affected by the en-
vironment and to be observed in different stages of their likely transformation
from infalling star-forming spirals to cluster S0s
It is apparently hard to reconcile the peculiar H morphologies of spirals
in nearby clusters with the fact that the distribution of H equivalent widths
EWs for blue galaxies in the 2dF and Sloan does not seem to vary signi-
cantly in clusters groups and eld Fig 9 in Balogh et al 2004 This apparent
contradiction still awaits an explanation
Trends with galaxy mass and downsizing effect
How do the results described above depend on the galaxy mass Does the
environmental dependence of galaxy properties change with galaxy mass
It has always been known that fainter lower mass galaxies on average are
bluer than higher mass galaxies and on average have more active star forma-
tion The references to old and new papers showing this could easily ll this
review
Recently the interest in this well established observational result has grown
and its implications have been more and more appreciated In all environments
lower mass galaxies have on average a more protracted star formation history
This implies that on average going to lower redshifts the maximum lumi-
nositymass of galaxies with signicant star formation activity progressively
decreases This downsizing effect observed in and outside of clusters in-
dicates an anti-hierachical history for the star formation in galaxies which
parallels a similar effect observed for AGNs Cristiani et al 2004 Shankar
et al 2004 The downsizing effect is thus another effect besides any envi-
ronmental effect see eg Fig 4 and Kauffmann et al 2003 2004 and the
dependence on the galaxy massluminosity cannot be ignored when trying to
trace evolutionary effects
In clusters innumerable results have shown the existence of a downsizing
effect Smail et al 1998 Gavazzi et al 2002 De Propris et al 2003 Tran et
al 2003 De Lucia et al 2004 Kodama et al 2004 Poggianti et al 2004 to
name a few A direct observation of this effect at high redshift is shown in
Fig 5 and illustrates the consequence of downsizing on the characteristics of
the color-magnitude red sequence in clusters A deciency of faint red galaxies
is observed compared to Coma in all four clusters studied despite of the variety
of cluster properties The red luminous galaxies are already in place on the red
sequence at z  08 while a signicant fraction of the faint galaxies must
have stopped forming stars and consequently moved on to the red sequence
at lower redshifts

in clusters in particular a description of the IR and radio-continuum studies

and kinematics of various types of galaxies the link between the star-formation

nonemission line galaxies as a function of the environment and the line emis-
sion from AGNs
By now mostly thanks to the scientic debate of the latest years it is
widespread wisdom that we are investigating a three-dimensional space whose
axis are redshift environment and galaxy mass In fact the evolutionary his-
tories and in particular the star formation activity of galaxies have similar
increasing trends as a function of higher redshift lower galaxy mass and
lower densitymass of the environment While observationally we are begin-
ning to ll this 3-parameter space the great theoretical challenge is to help
comprehend from a physical point of view why this is the history of our Uni-
Emission line galaxies in clusters
The results mentioned above do not yet match together into one coherent
picture and in some cases they might be apparently clashing with each other
The observational results in distant clusters both those regarding the star for-
mation activity and the morphologies point to a strong evolution Many galax-
ies have stopped forming stars in clusters quite recently and the morphology
of many disk galaxies must have changed Dense environments seem to accel-
erate the transformation of star-forming late-type galaxies into passive early-
type galaxies The local large redshift surveys have highlighted the existence
of trends of galaxy properties with local density that exist in all environments
This as well as several other lines of evidence suggests that whatever induces
the existence of a morphology-density and of a star-formation-density relation
is not effective solely in clusters On the other hand there is now solid evidence
and the gasstar formation results in nearby clusters are most convincing in
this respect that gas stripping is at work and affects most of the emission-line
galaxies in clusters or at least most of those galaxies in clusters that today
still have emission lines
Twenty years ago an expression often used in this eld was nature or nur-
ture Nowadays especially within the context of a hierarchically growing
Universe the distinction between nature and nurture has become very subtle
also from a philosophical point of view
The example of the most massive ellipticals is instructive in this respect
They are found in the cluster cores and the current cosmological paradigm
tells us that they were in the highest density peaks of the primordial uctu-
ations thus have always been in the highest density regions since very high
redshifts Therefore at least part of the morphology-density relation and of
the star-formation density SFD relation since their stars all formed very early
on must have been in place at z  3 Is it more correct to call this a primor-
dial effect  because established at very high redshift  or environmental 
because related to the local density of the environment but the environment
of these ellipticals at z  10 is strongly related to their environment today can
we speak of galaxy destiny
On the other hand we know that the morphology-density relation in clusters
has evolved with redshift at least as far as the disk galaxies are concerned
and we can directly observe its evolution Therefore we know that while the
existence of a morphology-density relation can be traced back to the rst epoch
of galaxy formation its evolution and thus its exact shape at any time depends
on the subsequent evolution likely strongly inuenced by the environment
Is the existence of the MD and SFD relation primordial and its evolution
environmental
Perhaps also we as behavioural psychologists Ridley 2003 are coming to
realize that nature and nurture are so intertwined that they become to a certain
extent indistiguishable and unseparable
