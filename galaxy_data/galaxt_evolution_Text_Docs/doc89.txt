Abstract
Giant Low Surface Brightness GLSB galaxies are amongst the most massive spiral
galaxies that we know of in our Universe Although they fall in the class of late type spiral
galaxies their properties are far more extreme They have very faint stellar disks that
are extremely rich in neutral hydrogen gas but low in star formation and hence low in
surface brightness They often have bright bulges that are similar to those found in early
type galaxies The bulges can host low luminosity Active Galactic Nuclei AGN that
have relatively low mass black holes GLSB galaxies are usually isolated systems and are
rarely found to be interacting with other galaxies In fact many GLSB galaxies are found
under dense regions close to the edges of voids These galaxies have very massive dark
matter halos that also contribute to their stability and lack of evolution In this paper we
briey review the properties of this unique class of galaxies and conclude that both their
isolation and their massive dark matter halos have led to the low star formation rates and
the slower rate of evolution in these galaxies

Introduction
Giant low surface brightness GLSB galaxies are some of the largest spiral galaxies in
our nearby universe However for decades these galaxies remained undetected in galaxy
surveys This is because their optically dim stellar disks have a brightness that lies close to
or below the brightness of the night sky Early photometric studies of galaxies determined
that the central surface brightness of galaxies always lies above the brightness limit of
B0  2165 mag arcsec1 this is called the Freemans Law Freeman 1970 How-
ever Disney 1976 predicted that there may be a population of galaxies that lie below
this brightness limit His study indicated that the brightness of the night sky biased ob-
servations against detecting low luminosity galaxies such as low surface brightness LSB
galaxies Decades later with better telescopes it became possible to detect sources well
below the Freeman limit Recent surveys have revealed that LSB galaxies contribute a
very signicant fraction of the total galaxy number density in the local z  01 universe
Trachternach et al 2006 The rst large LSB or GLSB galaxy to be detected was Ma-
lin 1 It was accidentally discovered in a survey of low luminosity galaxies Bothun et al
1987 In the following years several GLSB galaxies were discovered Bothun et al 1990
Schombert et al 1992 Sprayberry et al 1993
Although morphologically LSB galaxies span a very wide range from dwarfs and ir-
regulars to very large disk galaxies McGaugh et al 1995 they are broadly of two types
1 LSB dwarf and irregular galaxies and 2 disk LSB galaxies of which the larger ones
are called GSLB galaxies Regardless of their size or morphology all LSB galaxies share
the following common characteristics poor star formation rates low metallicities diuse
stellar disks and extended HI gas disks Impey  Bothun 1997 The LSB dwarfs and
irregulars form the larger fraction of LSB galaxies studies indicate that they are the
most dominant component of the faint end of the luminosity function in our local Uni-
verse Geller et al 2012 Although optically they are often dicult to detect they are
easily detected in HI surveys Unlike the more isolated larger LSB galaxies dwarf LSB
galaxies can be found in relatively densely populated parts of the universe such as galaxy
groups Sabatini Davies Scaramella et al 2003 The fainter ones are generally found in
underdense environments such as nearby voids eg Pustilnik et al 2011
Disk LSB galaxies are not as common as LSB dwarf galaxies Studies show that they
can span a range of sizes eg Beijersbergen et al 1999 but their Hubble morphological
type is well dened as late type spirals - Sc or Sd
In some cases where there is a
very prominent bulge eg UGC 6614 RSAr the galaxies are classied as early type
spirals see Figure 1a But their low surface brightness disks and other properties such
as extended HI disks conrm that they are extreme late type spirals The really large
LSB galaxies are usually referred to as giant LSB GLSB galaxies and are generally
isolated systems Bothun et al 1993 They are found to lie closer to the walls of voids
Rosenbaum et al 2009 This review will focus only on GLSB galaxies their nuclear
and disk properties are very distinct from the LSB dwarfs galaxies or smaller LSB disk
galaxies
Apart from their rather exotic and rare nature GLSB galaxies provide an interesting
sample to study how massive dark matter halos can aect star formation and even nuclear
activity in galaxies They also provide an opportunity to understand how galaxies evolve
in relative isolation In this paper we will review the overall properties of GLSB galaxies
and then discuss how their dark matter content and isolation shapes their evolution
2 Structural Properties  Disks and Bulges
GLSB galaxies like high surface brightness HSB spiral galaxies have radial surface
brightness proles that follows an exponential form ie r  0er where r is the
disk radius and  is the disk scale length de Blok van der Hulst  Bothun 1995 The
main dierence is that the extrapolated disk central brightness B0 lies between 22 to
23 magarcsec2 which is much lower thani thant observed in regular galaxies and lower
than the the Freeman limit Some GLSB galaxies have prominent bulges eg UGC 6614
and UGC 9024 McGaugh and Bothun 1994 In such cases the surface brightness prole
can be tted with two exponential proles The stellar disks are usually very large and
greater than  10 Kpc McGaugh and Bothun 1994 but the smaller LSB disk galaxies
have stellar disks with  4-5 Kpc
The low luminosity of the LSB disks indicates a low surface density of stars The
maximum disk hypothesis can be applied to these stellar disks to determine upper limits
to the mass to luminosity ML ratios and stellar disk masses These upper mass limits
show that LSB galaxies have lower stellar surface mass densities than normal spiral galaxies
de Blok McGaugh  Rubin 2001 Mass modeling of LSB galaxy rotation curves using
stellar population synthesis models also indicates a high ML and low stellar disk surface
densities Swaters et al 2000 The diuse disks of GLSB galaxies contrasts sharply with
their bright bulges Pickering et al 1999 A good example is UGC 6614 Figure 1a its
LSB stellar disk is barely visible except for the tightly wound spiral arms GLSB galaxy
disks often have spiral arms that can be followed well into their disks  eg NGC 5905
Figure 1b But the arms are notably thin indicating that they are not associated with
very massive star forming regions as seen in HSB galaxies In some galaxies the arms are
practically absent eg UGC 1922 ONeil  Schinnerer 2003 Bars are not common in
GLSB galaxies and only 10-15 of LSB disk galaxies have bars in the centers of their
disks Bars and evidence for tidal interactions are weak in LSB galaxies Mihos et al
1999 The overall lack of strong disk instabilities suggests that the dark halo must be
strong in all LSB galaxies and especially for the more massive GLSB galaxies Mayer 
Wadsley 2004
Although most LSB disk galaxies appear to be late type systems with relatively small
bulges their near-infrared images clearly show that a large fraction of them have signicant
bulges Galaz et al 2002 Beijersbergen et al 1999 These bulges are very prominent in
the GLSB galaxies eg UGC 6614 Malin 1 Malin 2 and are usually classical bulges In
some GLSB galaxies such as UGC 2936 the bulge is boxy and is possibly a pseudobulge
UGC 2936 also has signicant star formation in its disk both features indicate that there
maybe ongoing secular evolution in this galaxy resulting in a more oval than spherical
bulge Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 GLSB galaxy bulges are notably bright and studies
suggest that they are similar to the bulges of HSB galaxies both in stellar population
and metallicities Morelli et al 2012 Thus their bulges are suprisingly very dierent
from their low luminosity disks McGaugh et al 1995 both in structure and composition
This suggests that the disks and bulges have dierent evolutionary histories and did not
co-evolve
3 Gas Content  HI and Molecular Gas
One of the main features of all LSB galaxies dwarf irregulars and disks is that they
have large amounts of HI gas ONeil et al 2004 The HI masses are so large in GLSB
galaxies 109
 1010 that they are comparable to the typical stellar masses of late type
galaxies Matthews et al 2001 and make up a considerable fraction of their baryonic mass
McGaugh et al 2000 The HI proles and maps show that the gas is far more extended
than the stellar disks Pickering et al 1997 de Blok McGaugh van der Hulst van 1995
But although the HI masses are large the HI gas surface densities  in M pc2 are
much lower than that of normal late type spirals de Blok McGaugh  van der Hulst
1996 The low  of the HI distribution has important implications for the star formation
properties of GLSB and LSB galaxies in general see next section The HI disks are often
ared or warped Matthews  Kenneth 2003 Pickering et al 1999 or lopsided Das et
al 2007 Such features are more commonly found at larger radii where the stellar disk
surface density decreases and the HI disk begins to be more dominant Thus they appear
more prominent in the outer disks of spirals where the eect of the halo becomes more
prominent Reichard et al 2008 The HI rotation curves of GLSB galaxies are usually
slowly rising but atten at relatively high velocities or in some cases continue rising well
into their disks This is a clear indication of their large dark matter content which is also
seen in their relatively high mass to luminsoity ML ratios
Molecular hydrogen gas H2 is rare in LSB galaxies de Blok  van der Hulst 1998
Braine Herpin  Radford 2000 but is this is not suprising considering their low star
formation rates and low metallicities Schombert et al 1992 H2 has been detected in
only a handful of GLSB galaxies and so far never detected in LSB dwarf galaxies ONeil
et al 2000 Matthews  Gao 2001 ONeil et al 2003 Matthews et al2005 Das et al
2006 The masses detected are in the range 108
 109 M which though signicant are
low compared to the galaxy HI gas masses and also low compared to the MH2MHI
fractions observed in normal galaxies The molecular gas distribution has been studied
in very few galaxies Malin 2 Das et al 2010 UGC 1922 ONeil  Schinnerer 2003
In UGC 1922 it is mainly concentrated within the inner disk but in Malin 2 it is more
extended and supports star formation Pickering et al 1997 In all these studies CO10
or CO21 was used as a tracer for molecular hydrogen It is possible that the H2 exists
as cold molecular gas or dark gas and resides within photodissociation regions where
the CO molecule has been dissociated by ionizing stellar radiation but H2 molecules still
exist Planck Collaboration et al 2011 Grenier et al 2005
In such cases the cold
molecular hydrogen gas may exist as diuse dark gas but will go undetected in millimeter
CO observations But this is unlikely to be the case in GLSB or dwarf LSB galaxies as
these galaxies are so poor in dust and low in metallicities that the neutral gas will not
be able to cool enough or fast enough to form H2 molecules via dust particles adsorption
Thus the lack of H2 gas in these galaxies is probably real Gerritsen  de Blok 1999
4 Star formation Properties
In general LSB galaxies are low in star formation ONeil Oey  Bothun 2007 especially
when measured per unit stellar mass Schombert Maciel McGaugh 2011 This is es-
pecially true for LSB dwarf galaxies which are some of the most dark matter dominated
systems in our Universe H observations of the larger LSB disk galaxies and epsecially
GLSB galaxies reveal that they have patches of localized star formation eg Auld et
al 2006 associated with faint spiral arms or distributed sporadically over their disks
Suprisingly in spite of their low star formation rates SFR many studies clearly show
that their colors ie B-V or B-R are ususally blue and comparable to normal galaxies
van der Hulst et al 1993 This is partly due to the larger number of localized pockets
of star formation in GLSB disks which are generally large But it may also be due to
the fact that the V or R magnitude of these galaxies are low since their stellar disks are
diuse So the color ie B-V or B-R is high even though the star formation rates
are low A signicant population of red LSB galaxies have also been observed But these
are generally smaller galaxies and do not have GLSB disks ONeil Bothun Schombert
The star formation in GLSB galaxies is predominantly associated with their bulges
and very inner disks In contrast to the LSB disks the bulges have a younger population
of stars and show ongoing star formation Morelli et al 2012 The metal content is
often solar and similar to HSB galaxies Evidence for bulge star formation is also seen
in the X-ray observations of GLSB galaxies as the diuse emission associated with star
formation is mainly conned to their bulges Das et al 2009 Thus in general GLSB
bulges are similar to the bulges of HSB galaxies in terms of star formation properties In
some galaxies such as the very massive and distant GLSB galaxy Malin 1 there is both
a bright bulge and inner disk that appears to be similar to normal galaxies in surface
brightness and structure Barth 2009 Galex UV observations of the disks indicate that
GLSB galaxies have UV emission that extended well beyond their optical disks Wyder
 Treyer 2011 The extended morphology and UV colors indicate that star formation
occurred in bursts and had an eciency far lower than that found in normal galaxies
Boissier et al 2008 Thus the bright bulges and LSB disks of GLSB galaxies appear to
have had very dierent star formation histories
Several studies have tried to understand the lack of star formation in LSB galaxies
In general the presence of copious amounts of neutral hydrogen gas in galaxies indicates
that they have the capacity to form stars through cloud collapse and star formation But
although LSB galaxies are gas rich they are very poor in star formation Both their
star formation rates SFRs and metallicities are low Also as mentioned in the previous
section molecular gas which is always found associated with star formation is rarely
detected in these galaxies One of the reasons for the low SFR is the lack of strong
global instabilities as well as local disk instabilities Both types of instabilities induce
cloud collisions and shocks that result in gas compression and gas cooling these processes
can trigger star formation The global disk instability criterion Xm depends on  see
Mihos de Blok  McGaugh 1997 If  is low global nonaxisymmetric disk instabilities
such as spiral arms and bars cannot form In GLSB galaxies the low surface densities of
both the stellar and HI disks results in the formation of only small bars and weak spiral
features Such weak nonaxisymmetric instabilities cannot drive the large scale massive
star formation that is commonly observed in HSB galaxies Alternatively localized star
formation can be produced by local disk instabilities The latter is measured by Toomres
Q parameter which also depends on the  of the HI gas disk But again since  is low in
GLSB galaxies local instabilities are also dicult to form van der Hulst et al 1993 Das
et al 2010 Localized star is observed in some GLSB disks it may be due to distant tidal
interactions eg NGC 5905 van Moorsel 1982 or small accretion events eg Malin 2
Pickering et al 1997 The other two factors responsible for low SFRs in LSB galaxies
are their low metal content and low dust masses Gerritsen  de Blok 1999 Metals are
important for gas cooling and the presence of dust is important for the formation of H2
molecules The lack of both which is intimately related to the low SFRs in GLSB galaxies
contributes to the slow evolution of these galaxies
5 Nuclear Properties
LSB dwarfs irregulars and smaller disk galaxies show very little nuclear activity But the
larger LSB disk galaxies often show nuclear star formation and some have Active Galactic
Nuclei AGN A large fraction of GLSB galaxies are relatively bulgeless McGaugh 
Bothun 1994 but there is often a bright core due to nuclear star formation
In most
bulgeless galaxies the nuclear activity appears as a luminous point in an often featureless
low luminosity disk Matthews et al 1999 Strong H and OI emission lines in their
spectra indicate ongoing nuclear star formation High resolution ground based imaging
indicates that the star formation is often in the form of Kpc scale rings as seen in
the GLSB galaxy NGC 5905 Comeron et al 2010 Hubble space telescope HST
observations have shown that the nuclear star formation can lead to the formation of
compact nuclear star clusters that may sometimes co-exist with AGN activity Seth et al
2008 This activity can contribute to the formation of a central massive object CMO
and lead to the buildup of a bulge in an otherwise bulgeless galaxy Davies Miller 
Bellovary 2011
A signicant fraction of bulge dominated GLSB galaxies show AGN activity Spray-
berry et al 1995 Galaz et al 2011 This is not suprising as studies indicate that the
growth of nuclear black holes in galaxies is intimately linked to the growth of their bulges
eg Silk  Rees 1998 Heckman et al 2004 The strong correlation of black hole mass
M with bulge mass or bulge luminosities in galaxies M   is due to this supermassive
black hole SMBH - bugle co-evolution eg Gultekin et al 2010 Early studies by
Schombert 1998 suggested that half of all GLSB galaxies have AGN but later studies
of larger samples show that only about 15 have AGN Burkholder Impey Sprayberry
2001 AGN activity will give rise to relatively broad H and H emission lines that can
be detected in the optical spectra of the galaxies whereas star formation will result in
narrower lines emission Schombert 1998 Depending on whether the lines have a broad
component or not the nuclei are either Seyfert 1 Sy 1 or Seyfert 2 Sy 2 type AGN
We examined at the SDSS spectra of a large sample of LSB disk galaxies collected from
the literature and conclude that the fraction of GLSB galaxies hosting AGN activity is
not more than 10 Subramanium et al 2013 in preparation The presence of an AGN
can also be conrmed from X-ray observations Compact X-ray emission associated with
the nucleus of a galaxy is a signature of AGN activity and has been detected in a few
GLSB galaxies such as UGC 6614 Naik et al 2009 UGC 2936 Das et al 2009a and
UGC 1455 Das et al 2009a Radio emission associated with AGN activity has also
been detected in several GLSB galaxies Das et al 2007 Mishra et al 2013 in prepara-
tion For example in UGC 6614 the nuclear emission has a compact core at millimeter
wavelengths 110 GHz Das et al 2006 as well as longer wavelengths 14 GHz Das et
al 2009b also see Figure 1a The spectral index  between these frequencies is close to
0 ie a at core suggesting that the source is denitely an AGN At lower frequency
of 610 MHz the emission is extended beyond the core Das et al 2009b and resembles
jets or outows associated with the AGN activity Mishra et al 2013 in preparation
Extended emission is also seen in 2327-0244 or UM 163 and resembles a one sided jet
Das et al 2009b Another example of compact radio emission associated with an AGN
is Malin 2 see Figure 1b
Not much is known about the black hole BH masses in LSB galaxies The large
bulges of GLSB galaxies suggests that they may harbour SMBHs ie BHs with masses
larger than 106
 107 M Rees 1984 The bulge mass and galaxy sizes suggest that
the BH masses may be comparable to the SMBHs in ellipticals However studies of the
optical spectra of Sy 1 type nuclei in GLSB galaxies suggest that the BH masses lie in the
 106 M range instead Ramya et al 2010 also see Table 2 Sy 1 AGN ususally
have a broad component in their H or H emission lines due to the eect of the broad
line region BLR clouds on the emission from the AGN Assuming virial equilibrium in
the BLR region the BH mass can be estimated from the width of the broad component of
the H or H emission lines and the line luminosities Greene  Ho 2007 This is a virial
approximation and hence does not give as accurate a BH mass as reverberation mapping
or stellar kinematic techniques But it does give an estimate of the BH mass range The
studies done so far Table 2 indicate that the the masses lie more in the intermediate black
hole IMBH mass range rather than SMBH rangei Ramya et al 2011 When the bulge
velocity dispersions are plotted against the BH masses to obtain the M- correlation for
these galaxies most GLSB galaxies are found to lie below the standard M- correlation
Gultekin et al 2011 The points have a scatter but their distribution suggests that
as the BH masses aproach 107 M they begin to follow the M- correlation for bright
galaxies Thus only GLSB galaxies that have SMBHs of mass larger than 107 M follow
the same evolutionary track as normal galaxies on the M- relation Subramanium et al
2013 in preparation
6 Dark Matter in GLSB galaxies
LSB galaxies are one of the most dark matter dominated systems in our nearby Universe
de Blok  McGaugh 1997 The only class of galaxies that have comparable baryon
to dark matter ratios are dwarf spheroidal galaxies which are the prime targets for dark
matter particle searches eg Abdo et al 2010 Traditionally low luminocity galaxies have
been associated with massive dark matter halos Kormendy 1990 Kormendy  Freeman
2004 In the case of GLSB galaxies the main observational evidence that suggests the
the presence of massive dark halos in these galaxies is the large ML ratios derived from
rotation curve tting methods McGaugh  de Blok 1998 Even when a maximum disk
is applied to the galaxies the dark matter is substantially more than the stellar and gas
mass combined The rotation curves in GLSB galaxies are slowly rising and atten at
velocities of 200 - 300 kms indicating the presence of very massive halos that have large
dynamical masses Pickering et al 1997 Another approach is to derive the ML ratio
from the galaxy colors Bell et al 2003 This method suggests that like most faint
galaxies LSB galaxies lie at the lower end of the luminosity curve and their masses were
undersestimated in earlier photometric surveys
One of the suprising and puzzling aspects of dark matter in LSB galaxies is that the
distribution does not follow predictions of cold dark matter CDM theories of structure
formation CDM predicts that the dark matter proles of galaxies should have cuspy
cores which follow the NFW proleNavarro Frenk White 1996 However rotation curve
studies show that in general LSB galaxies have proles that are closer to isothermal or at
core in shape there is no evidence for cuspy halos in these galaxies McGaugh Rubin 
de Blok 2001 Mass modeling of the hybrid H and HI rotation curves indicate core sizes
of the order of 1 Kpc de Blok et al 2001 However beam smearing in rotation curve
modeling has always cast some doubts against the isothermal core model  as it can result
in inaccuracies in estimating velocities in the very inner regions But further studies using
two dimensional high resolution optical velocity elds of LSB galaxies conrmed that the
the NFW model cannot work for the dark matter halos in low luminosity galaxies Kuzio
de Naray McGaugh de Blok 2008
7 Formation of GLSB galaxies
Not a lot is known about the formation of LSB galaxies and why they are so dierent
from HSB galaxies The early theoretical study by Homan et al
1992 which was
based on the hierarchical picture of galaxy formation showed that GLSB galaxies will
form in voids due to rare 3 perturbations in underdense regions of the universe The
smaller amplitude peaks 1-2 can be associated with the smaller dwarf LSB galaxies
Dekel  Silk 1986 Unlike GLSB galaxies their distribution does not depend so much on
the large scale structure and their distribution is more uniform In this picture the GLSB
galaxies that form in underdense regions will have normal bulges but extended unevolved
disks Although observations do indicate that GLSB galaxies are often isolated they do
not always populate the interior of voids Bothun et al 1986 Instead recent studies using
the SDSS show that the larger LSB galaxies are in fact more clustered towards the outer
edges of the void walls and laments Rosenbaum et al 2009 They reside in relatively
isolated environemnts compared to HSB galaxies Ceccarelli et al 2012 and their relative
isolation must have contributed to their slow evolution
Another possibility is that GLSB galaxies formed in halos with large angular momen-
tum Jimenez et al 1998 However in this picture GLSB galaxies form rather late at
z07 Other models of protogalaxies with large angular momentum also form extended
galaxy disks that are very similar to GLSB galaxies Dalcanton et al 1997 These results
indicate that there must some connection between the halos of GLSB galaxies and their
properties as well as evolution But halo spin alone cannot account for their relative
isolation and poor evolution Instead it is possible that a combination of both isolation
and halo spin are important to explain the unique properties of these galaxies and how
they t into the picture of hierarchical structure formation
8 Evolution of GLSB galaxies
Galaxies evolve by two methods i The rst is through external triggers such as interac-
tions with other galaxies and accretion of smaller galaxies Even distant interactions can
cause signicant non-axisymmetric disk perturbations that result in cloud collisions and
gas infall from the disks into the galaxy centers Both distant interactions and mergers
result in an overall increase in star formation Interactions can lead to the formation of
global disk instabilities such as bars and spiral arms These perturbations further enhance
the rate of gas infall to nucleus often leading to nuclear starburst Friedli  Benz 1993
All these processes can result in the build-up of central mass concentrations that often
weaken and even destroy bars in the centers of galaxies Norman Sellwood Hasan 1996
Das et al 2003 These processes also contribute to the growth of supermassive black
holes and AGN in galaxy nuclei The GLSB galaxy NGC 5905 is a good example Figure
1a the galaxy is interacting with the relatively distant spiral galaxy NGC 5908 and the
interaction has resulted in the formation of a strong bar The bar is associated with a
bright bulge that shows star formation and relatively tightly wound spiral arms ii The
second mode of galaxy evolution is the slow secular form which is due to internal processes
in galaxies Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 and is called the secular evolution of galaxies
In this process bars play a very prominent role as they exert gravitational torques oni disk
gas resulting in the pileup of gas in innerouter rings and in the centers of galaxies disks
Bars can become unstable resulting in the formation of disky bulges called pseudobulges
The GLSB galaxy UGC 2936 is a good example of secular evolution in an isolated galaxy
It has ongoing disk star formation which is evident from the radio continuum emission
maps Das et al 2009b and a disky bulge Pickering et al 1999
The two most crucial factors that aect the evolution of GLSB galaxies is their isolation
and their massive dark matter halos Since their discovery more than two decades ago
it has been clear that GLSB galaxies are relatively isolated compared to HSB galaxies
Sprayberry et al 1995 More recent studies using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
conrm that GLSB galaxies are generally isolated and often found close to the edges of
voids Galaz et al 2011 Rosenbaum et al 2009 The lack of interactions thus results
in less disk instabilities and hence lower star formation rates in GLSB galaxies This
leads to a slower pace of evolution in these galaxies But perhaps the most important
factor inuencing GLSB galaxy evolution is the massive dark matter halos found in these
systems It has been known from the early work of Ostriker  Peebles 1973 that galaxies
become more stable against the formation of disk instabilities when there is a massive halo
component Later numerical studies have shown that this result is very relevant to LSB
galaxies Mayer  Wadsley In fact simulations show that the dark matter halos stabilise
disks even in tidal interactions with other galaxies Mihos et al 1997 Thus the dark
matter halos slow down the formation of global and local non-axisymmetric instabilities
and hence lead to a slower rate of galaxy evolution in GLSB galaxies
9 Conclusions
1 GLSB galaxies are an extreme form of late type spiral galaxies They are characterised
by very faint extended disks that are low in stellar density but very rich in neutral
hydrogen gas They have low metal content and low star formation rates Molecular gas
which is associated with star formation is rarely detected in these galaxies
2 Their disks are embedded in very massive dark matter halos that make them very stable
against disk instabilities such as bars and spiral arms Hence star formation is low this
leads to very low surface brightness disks that often lie close to or below the brightness of
the night sky
3 Their nuclei sometimes host AGN activity Indirect estimates of the associated black
masses yield values 105
 107 M The AGN can also be detected in X-ray and radio
emission
4 The distribution morphology and disk dynamics of GLSB galaxies indicate that both
their isolation and dominant dark matter halos contribute to their extremely slow rate of
evolutuion compared to normal galaxies

Figure 1 a Figure on the left shows the R band image of the GLSB galaxy UGC 6614
The bar on the top right corner gives the lengthscale in Kpc The galaxy has a very
prominent bulge and tightly wound spiral arms that form a ring like structure outside the
bulge The LSB disk extends well beyond the plot boundaries b Figure on the right is
the 36 micron IRAC mid-infrared image of the GLSB galaxy NGC 5905 This is one of the
few GLSB galaxies that is also interacting with a nearby companion galaxy NGC 5908
The interaction has probably induced the formation of the bar and spiral arms
Figure 2 a The contours of VLA 14 GHz continuum emission from UGC 6614 overlaid
on the R band image of the galaxy The gure shows some extended features which could
be due to outows associated with the AGN This is clearer in the 610 GHz observations
Mishra et al 2013 in preparation b The contours of VLA 14 GHz continuum emission
from Malin 2 overlaid on the 2MASS K band image of the galaxy The compact emission
is centered on the galaxy nucleus and does not show extended features at 610 GHz Mishra
et al 2013 in preparation
