Abstract We use a new ber spectroscopic survey of 12 nearby poor
groups of galaxies to examine the dynamics and evolution of galaxies in
these common but poorly studied environments Some of our conclu-
sions are 1 The nine groups in our sample with diuse X-ray emission
are in fact bound systems with at least 20-50 group members with abso-
lute magnitudes as faint as MB  14  5 log10 h 2 Galaxies in each
X-ray-detected group have not all merged together because a signicant
fraction of the group mass lies outside of the galaxies and in a common
halo thereby reducing the rate of galaxy-galaxy interactions
3 The
similarity of the recent star formation histories and the fraction of early
type galaxies in some poor groups to those in rich clusters suggests that
cluster-specic environmental eects may not play a dominant role in the
recent evolution of cluster galaxies The evolution of group and cluster
members may be driven instead by galaxy-galaxy interactions which are
likely to occur with equal frequency in eld groups and in groups that
have recently fallen into clusters ie subclusters
Introduction
Most galaxies in the nearby universe including our own Galaxy belong to poor
groups of galaxies Despite the ubiquity of the group environment we know
little about the internal dynamics of groups and the evolution of group galaxies
outside of the Local Group To learn whether the diverse and detailed results on
the Local Group presented at this meeting apply elsewhere we must also survey
other poor groups
Because poor groups are apparent systems of fewer than ve bright  M 
galaxies past studies have been hampered by small number statistics Some of
the critical unanswered questions are 1 whether most poor groups are real
systems instead of chance projections of galaxies along the line-of-sight 2 why
many poor groups with their favorable environments for galaxy-galaxy merg-
ers have survived until now 3 and how galaxies evolve in groups where the
collisional eects of the intragroup gas and the tidal inuences of the global po-
tential are weaker than in rich clusters The advent of multi-object spectroscopy
now makes it possible to address such questions in unprecedented detail In this
talk I discuss the rst results obtained in collaboration with John Mulchaey
Carnegie Observatories from a ber spectroscopic survey of 12 nearby poor
groups Zabludo  Mulchaey 1998a Mulchaey  Zabludo 1998 Zabludo

2 Poor Groups What are They
21 Three Classes of Groups
Poor groups in the literature have been identied optically and fall into several
classes that can be distinguished by their X-ray properties and bright galaxy
morphologies Groups with detectable hot intra-group gas typically have a
giant  M   1 elliptical that is the brightest group galaxy BGG and that
lies near or on the peak of the smooth symmetric X-ray emission Mulchaey et
al 1996 In contrast groups without extended X-ray emission tend to optically
resemble the Local Group which consists of a few bright late-type galaxies and
their satellites If some non-X-ray-detected late-type-dominated groups evolve
into groups with a central giant elliptical and a detectable intra-group medium
then groups in transition may form a third class of objects We would expect the
cores of such systems to have signatures of recent dynamical evolution including
interacting galaxies and X-ray gas that does not coincide with the galaxies To
construct our sample we select poor groups from these three classes that also
have complementary X-ray images
The sample consists of 12 nearby 1500  cz  8000 km s1 optically-
selected groups from the literature for which there are existing sometimes
serendipitous pointed ROSATPSPC X-ray observations NGC 533 NGC 5129
NGC 5946 NGC 4325 NGC 741 NGC 2563 HCG 42 HCG 62 HCG 90 NGC
664 NCG 491 and NGC 7582 Nine of the groups are X-ray-detected HCG 90
Hickson 1982 a possible transitional object with several interacting galaxies
in its core Longo et al 1994 is only marginally X-ray-detected Ponman et
al 1996
It is important to stress that our group sample is biased with re-
spect to published group catalogs in which less than half of the groups are
X-ray-detected The sample is weighted toward X-ray groups because of the
likelihood that they are bound systems and the most evolved poor groups
22 Bound or Superpositions
The issue of whether many poor groups even those identied from redshift
surveys are bound systems instead of chance superpositions of galaxies along
the line-of-sight has been a puzzle The existence of one poor group our Local
Group is unchallenged In contrast Ramella et al 1989 show that  30 of
groups of three or four galaxies in the CfA Redshift Survey Huchra et al 1995
are probably unbound geometric projections The detection of a signicant
population of fainter members would be an important rst step in identifying
poor groups that are real
Using the Las Campanas ber spectrograph designed by Steve Shectman
we measured the  100 brightest galaxies projected within 15  15 deg2 of
the center of each of the 12 sample groups The radial velocity distributions for
galaxies in the elds of the nine X-ray-detected groups each reveal  20-50 group
members down to absolute magnitudes of MB  14 to 16  5 log10 h The
surprisingly large membership the central concentration of early type galaxies
the similarity of the BGGs position and orientation to those of the diuse X-
ray emission the consistency of the optical velocity dispersion and the X-ray
temperature and the short crossing times  005 of a Hubble time of the X-
ray groups suggest that they are bound systems not geometric superpositions
of galaxies and that the group cores are close to virialization or virialized
Because we do not detect diuse X-ray emission and nd only 5-8 members
in the three non-X-ray-detected groups we are unable to determine their dy-
namical state The non-X-ray groups which consist of one or two M  or brighter
spirals with several fainter galaxies that may be satellites are morphologically
akin to the Local Group although our samples are not suciently deep to ascer-
tain whether any group has a dwarf spheroidal population like that of the Local
Group van den Bergh 1992 If the non-X-ray groups are dynamically similar
to the Local Group they are bound see Zaritsky 1994 Our current data do
not exclude this possibility  the velocity dispersions of the non-X-ray groups
are consistent with the upper limits on their X-ray luminosities Mulchaey 
Zabludo 1998
3 Poor Groups Why are They
If some poor groups are bound systems then another critical question is why
they exist at all Poor groups have higher galaxy densities than the eld and
lower velocity dispersions than cluster cores making them favorable sites for
galaxy-galaxy mergers Barnes 1985 The likelihood of mergers and the short
group crossing times  005 of a Hubble time suggest that most groups should
have already merged into one object Therefore either bound groups are collaps-
ing for the rst time like the Local Group Zaritsky 1994 or only a small fraction
of the group mass is tied to the galaxies lowering the rate of galaxy-galaxy inter-
actions relative to a galaxy-dominated system and allowing the group to survive
many crossing times Governato et al 1991 Bode et al 1993 Athanassoula et
al 1997 To address this issue by measuring the underlying mass distribution
of poor groups we use the improved statistics of our spectroscopic survey
The velocity dispersion of the combined group sample does not decrease
signicantly with radius from the central  01h1 Mpc to at least  05h1
Mpc in contrast to the more than factor of two decrease that would be observed
if the entire mass were concentrated within 01h1 Mpc The extended mass is
either in the galaxies in a common halo through which the galaxies move or in
both the galaxies and a diuse halo If all the mass were tied to the galaxies most
of the mass would be associated with the bright central elliptical in those groups
in which the BGG dominates the light For groups with a few galaxies that have
luminosities comparable to the BGG the velocity dispersion would be increased
at large radii by subgroups consisting of a massive galaxy and the subgroup
members that are orbiting it If this picture were accurate we would expect the
velocity dispersion proles of groups with several comparably bright galaxies to
be shallower than those in which the BGG is dominant However the combined
velocity dispersion prole of a subsample of two groups HCG 42 and NGC 741
in which the BGG dominates the light ie the BGG luminosity exceeds the
combined luminosity of the other M  or brighter galaxies is indistinguishable
from that of the entire sample Therefore we conclude that most of the group
mass lies in a smooth extended dark halo
This result argues that poor groups survive longer than predicted by models
in which all the mass is tied to individual galaxies and may explain why so many
poor groups are observed in lieu of single merger remnants
4 Poor Groups How do Galaxies Evolve in Them
41 Distribution of Early Type Fractions
The factors that might aect the evolution of galaxies in poor groups are dierent
from those present in rich clusters If clusters evolve hierarchically by accret-
ing poor groups of galaxies subclusters members of an infalling group have
recently experienced the hot dense cluster environment for the rst time There-
fore galaxies in poor groups in the eld are a control sample for understanding
the factors that inuence the evolution of their counterparts in subclusters
For example we can compare the morphologies and recent star formation
histories of galaxies in the subclusters of complex clusters like Coma Caldwell
 Rose 1997 with those of galaxies in poor eld groups Dierences between
the samples would argue that cluster environment is important in transforming
galaxies at the present epoch On the other hand the lack of such dierences
would suggest as the simplest explanation either that star formation and mor-
phology are inuenced by mechanisms present in both eld groups and sub-
clusters such as galaxy-galaxy encounters or that the eects of environment
on galaxies are insignicant compared with conditions at the time of galaxy
formation
Despite the usefulness of group galaxies as a control sample their properties
especially at faint magnitudes are not well-known Past work has included only
the four or ve brightest galaxies which biases samples toward ellipticals and
has targeted only the central  03h1 Mpc where early types concentrate
Therefore to compare the morphologies and star formation histories of group
and cluster members we must sample both environments to similar physical
radii and absolute magnitude limits
In the X-ray groups the early type fraction f  ranges widely from  55
HCG 62 NGC 741 and NGC 533 to  25 eg NGC 2563 The latter value
is characteristic of the eld  30 Oemler 1992 We nd no early types among
the 6-8 galaxies in each of the three non-X-ray groups The early type fractions
of  55 in NGC 533 NGC 741 and HCG 62 are most surprising because they
are consistent with those of rich clusters for similar physical radii and absolute
magnitude limits  055-065 Whitmore et al 1993
42 Early Type Fraction vs Velocity Dispersion
The correlation between early type fraction and group velocity dispersion is
signicant at the  0999 level The form of the relation cannot be the same for
rich clusters  our t to the group data predicts that the early type fraction in
a r  1000 km s1 cluster is an unphysical f  124 Therefore the relation
must turn up between the poor group and rich cluster regimes The group f  r
relation implies either that galaxy morphology is set by the local potential size
at the time of galaxy formation Hickson Huchra  Kindl 1988 andor that
r and f increase as a group evolves Diaferio et al 1995
The early type fractions in our highest velocity dispersion groups r  400
km s1 are as high as in rich clusters If some early type galaxies are evolved
merger remnants then the galaxy populations of higher velocity dispersion
groups are more evolved on average At some point in the groups evolution
perhaps at a velocity dispersion near 400 km s1 any morphological evolution
resulting from galaxy mergers ceases and the fraction of merger remnants in
poor groups and rich clusters is comparable The implicit upturn in our f  r
relation suggests such a saturation point
Alternatively the similarity of some group and cluster early type fractions
and the steepening of the f  r relationship at high r might arise from con-
ditions at the time of galaxy formation For example it is possible that poor
groups such as NGC 533 and rich clusters like Coma begin as similar mass density
perturbations with correspondingly similar galaxy populations In this simple
picture NGC 533 does not develop a cluster-size potential because its eld lacks
the surrounding groups that Coma later accretes
In summary the cluster-like fraction of early type galaxies in NGC 533
NGC 741 and HCG 62 indicate that clusters are not the only environments
with copious quantities of E and S0 galaxies The simplest explanation is either
that uctuations in the initial conditions permitted early types to form in these
groups comparatively low velocity dispersion low galaxy density environments
or that the galaxies subsequent evolution was the product of a mechanism such
as galaxy-galaxy interactions common to both groups in the eld and groups
that become subclusters Although additional environmental mechanisms may
aect the evolution of cluster galaxies such cluster-specic processes are not
required to explain the current data A cluster that evolves hierarchically from
subclusters with the properties of NGC 533 NGC 741 and HCG 62 will have at
least initially a similar galaxy population
43 Star Formation in Early Types
The star formation histories of galaxies in poor groups provide additional insight
into the environmental factors that may inuence the evolution of galaxies One
approach is to examine the spectra of the early types for evidence of on-going star
formation or of a young stellar population We can then compare the fraction
of E and S0 group members that have recently formed stars with a sample from
rich clusters with complex structure
Star formation is on-going or has ended within the last  2 Gyr in eight
of the 64 early type group members for which we have spectra 12 This
fraction is roughly the same for clusters such as Coma with infalling groups
 15 Caldwell  Rose 1997 This result and the similarity of the early type
fractions of some poor groups to rich clusters suggests that an environmental
mechanism present in both groups and subclusters may be responsible For
example galaxy-galaxy encounters can produce bursts of star formation eg
Londsdale et al 1984 Kennicutt et al 1987 Sanders et al 1988 in which the
gas is consumed or stripped away
Although our observations of poor groups suggest that the eects of cluster
environment are not necessary to produce the early type fractions and star for-
mation episodes of nearby clusters we suspect that the star formation histories
of group and subcluster galaxies will begin to deviate after the subcluster and
cluster mix Proposed gas removal processes including ram pressure stripping
and the tidal limitation of galaxy halos which are more ecient in clusters than
in groups may eventually suppress star formation in cluster galaxies Compar-
ative studies of the Hi content of eld group and cluster galaxies will help to
resolve this issue

Discussion
Terndrup Could you please elaborate on your remarks about the coupling be-
tween the elliptical fraction in groups and group environment
Zabludo We observe a strong correlation between group early-type fraction
and velocity dispersion This correlation could result either from an increase in
the early type fraction and velocity dispersion as a group evolves where galaxy
morphologies change due to a mechanism such as galaxy-galaxy mergers or from
conditions at the time of galaxy formation that tie the E and S0 fraction to the
potential well depth early on One point suggesting that group galaxy evolution
is aected by environment at later epochs is that this correlation has a more
shallow slope than that for rich clusters In other words there seems to be a
saturation point at which early type fraction stops increasing with velocity dis-
persion This point is at about 400 to 500 km s1 which is about the velocity
dispersion that a poor group would require such that an M  galaxy would ex-
perience a merger within a Hubble time Therefore it is possible that mergers
cause some evolution in the early type fraction of poor groups and cease to be
eective in richer groups and clusters
