Abstract The SydneyAAO Multi-object Integral eld spectrograph SAMI Galaxy Survey
is an ongoing project to obtain integral eld spectroscopic observations of 3400 galaxies by
mid-2016 Including the pilot survey a total of 1000 galaxies have been observed to date
making the SAMI Galaxy Survey the largest of its kind in existence This unique dataset allows
a wide range of investigations into dierent aspects of galaxy evolution
The rst public data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey consisting of 107 galaxies drawn from the
full sample has now been released By giving early access to SAMI data for the entire research
community we aim to stimulate research across a broad range of topics in galaxy evolution As
the sample continues to grow the survey will open up a new and unique parameter space for
galaxy evolution studies

1 Introduction
Large-scale spectroscopic galaxies surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS
York et al 2000 and Galaxy And Mass Assembly GAMA Driver et al 2009 2011
survey are well established and powerful tools for investigations of galaxy evolution
However they are limited by only observing a single aperture in the centre of each galaxy
so are inherently unable to investigate the spatially distributed properties of galaxies
Integral eld spectrographs IFSs provide the information missed by traditional bre-
based surveys The spatially resolved spectroscopic data produced by an IFS can be used
to measure diverse quantities such as rotation curves spatial distributions of star forma-
tion and radial variation in stellar populations Until recently technical limitations made
IFS observations dicult and time-consuming limiting sample sizes to a few hundred
at most eg 260 in ATLAS-3D Cappellari et al 2011 and 600 in CALIFA Sanchez
et al 2012
A massive step forward is now being taken by instruments that can make IFS observa-
tions of multiple objects at once The SydneyAAO Multi-object Integral eld spectro-
graph SAMI is one of the rst of such instruments with 13 integral eld units IFUs
each with a eld of view of 15cid48cid48 that can be deployed across a 1-degree patrol eld
Croom et al 2012 Each IFU consists of a bundle of 61 optical bres lightly fused to
have a high 75 lling factor Bryant et al 2014a SAMI is installed on the 39-m
Anglo-Australian Telescope AAT feeding the existing AAOmega spectrograph Sharp
et al 2006 For the rst time SAMI allows the rapid generation of large samples of IFS
observations

2 The SAMI Galaxy Survey
The SAMI Galaxy Survey is an ongoing project using SAMI to obtain integral eld
spectroscopic data for 3400 galaxies with an expected completion date of mid-2016
At the time of writing 1000 galaxies have been observed including the pilot survey
of 100 galaxies Early science investigations have included studies of galactic winds

et al 2014 and star formation in dwarf galaxies Richards et al MNRAS accepted

21 Target selection
The target galaxies for the SAMI Galaxy Survey are split into two samples a eld and
group sample from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly GAMA survey G09 G12 and
G15 elds and a cluster sample from a set of eight galaxy clusters The inclusion of a
dedicated cluster sample extends the range of environmental densities to higher values
than a simple mass- or luminosity-selected sample of galaxies would provide Full details
of the target selection are provided in Bryant et al 2014b
The target selection for the GAMA regions consisting of a tiered set of volume-limited
samples is illustrated in Fig 1 The gure also marks the galaxies included in the Early
Data Release EDR discussed in Section 3
22 Data reduction
The initial steps in the SAMI data reduction up to the production of row-stacked spec-
tra RSS are carried out using version 562 of 2dfdr The dedicated SAMI pipeline
Allen et al 2014a then performs ux calibration using separate observations of spec-
trophotometric standard stars and corrects for telluric absorption based on simultaneous
observations of a secondary standard star in the galaxy eld The set of 7 dithered
frames in each eld are then resampled onto a regular grid and combined to produce a
pair of datacubes representing the blue and red arms of AAOmega for each galaxy

et al 2014
23 Data quality
A comprehensive assessment of the quality of the data produced by SAMI is presented
in Allen et al 2014b here we provide some key results
Through the use of dome at elds we achieve a at eld accuracy of 051 in most
of the blue arm and 0304 in the red arm We use a combination of CuAr arc lamps
and sky lines to achieve a wavelength calibration accuracy of cid3901 pixels or better The
continuum sky emission is typically subtracted with an accuracy of 1
Comparing synthetic g  r colours to established photometry we nd a mean oset
of 0043 mag SAMI data redder with standard deviation 0040 mag The observed g-
band magnitudes have a mean oset of 0047 mag relative to SDSS photometry SAMI
data brighter with a scatter of 027 mag although a signicant contribution to this
scatter comes from diculties in dening magnitudes for extended irregular sources
The median full width at half maximum FWHM of the nal point spread function in
the datacubes is 2cid48cid481 with a typical range from 1cid48cid485 to 3cid48cid480
24 Ancillary data
The SAMI Galaxy Survey is backed up by a wide range of ancillary datasets By tar-
getting the GAMA elds we have available deep spectroscopic data as well as imaging
from current and future surveys ranging from the UV to radio including GALEX MIS
VST KiDS VISTA VIKING WISE Herschel-ATLAS GMRT and ASKAP Driver et al
2011 The spectroscopic information is crucial for robustly dening the environments of
the SAMI Galaxy Survey targets Brough et al 2013 while the multi-wavelength imag-

ing data provides a wealth of information on processes eg dust-obscured star formation
radio AGN that may not be apparent in the optical data The cluster sample also has
a variety of ancillary data including archival X-ray observations from XMM-Newton and
Chandra and we have carried out a dedicated redshift survey to characterise the clusters
and give robust classications of cluster membership Owers et al in prep
3 Early Data Release
We have recently made available a set of fully calibrated datacubes for 107 galaxies
forming the SAMI Galaxy Survey Early Data Release EDR Allen et al 2014b The
galaxies were selected from the GAMA regions of the survey Also available are the
datacubes of the corresponding secondary standard stars and a table of ancillary data
including quantities such as stellar mass eective radius and surface brightness All data
can be downloaded from the SAMI Galaxy Survey EDR website
4 Conclusions
The SAMI Galaxy Survey now includes 1000 galaxies with IFS observations and will
grow to 3400 galaxies by mid-2016 This unique dataset is providing new insight into a
broad range of topics in galaxy evolution from star formation in dwarf galaxies to stellar
kinematics in galaxy clusters As the sample grows further results will come into reach
based on robust statistical analyses of the galaxy population something that has rarely
been possible with IFS data in the past As a starting point we have publicly released
the datacubes for 107 galaxies allowing the research community access for scientic
investigations and preparation for the full dataset
