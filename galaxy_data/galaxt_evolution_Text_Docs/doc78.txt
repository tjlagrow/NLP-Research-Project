RESUMEN
El resumen sera traducido al espanol por los editores We present a model for understanding the
origins and evolution of galaxy morphologies from a phenomenological perspective The model includes an
observationally motivated prescription for star formation in galaxy disks as well as a merger-driven starburst
mode of star formation We consider the formation of bulges and ellipticals both in mergers and by global
instabilities in disks We use our model to investigate the fundamental properties of disk galaxies and the

ABSTRACT
We present a model for understanding the origins and evolution of galaxy morphologies from a phenomenological
perspective The model includes an observationally motivated prescription for star formation in galaxy disks
as well as a merger-driven starburst mode of star formation We consider the formation of bulges and ellipticals
both in mergers and by global instabilities in disks We use our model to investigate the fundamental properties
of disk galaxies and the eects of surface-brightness limits on large galaxy surveys
Key Words GALAXIES FORMATION
1 INTRODUCTION
Our understanding of galaxy formation in a cos-
mological context has increased considerably over
the last decade through the use of phenomenologi-
cal models In these models stars form primarily in
galaxy disks and bulges are assumed to form when
two or more disk galaxies merge or when bar in-
stabilities lead to vertical heating of the disk We
use such a model for the evolution of galaxy mor-
phologies to investigate the statistics of the fun-
damental parameters of disk galaxies These re-
sults are particularly important for the interpreta-
tion of magnitude- or diameter-limited galaxy sur-
veys which may miss a signicant population of low-
surface-brightness LSB galaxies
2 MODEL INGREDIENTS
The model used in this work is presented and
discussed in detail in a paper soon to be published

The basic ingredients are
1 the merging history of dark-matter haloes
taken directly from an N-body simulation
2 galaxy-galaxy merging and hot gas stripping
3 the formation and evolution of gas disks includ-
ing the gravitational eects of the baryons
4 star formation in galaxy disks according to a

6 injection of gas and metals from star formation
into the cold ISM
7 reheating of the cold ISM by supernovae
8 stellar population synthesis

fects of dust extinction
3 PROPERTIES OF DISK GALAXIES AT z  0
In gure 1 we plot the number density of galax-
ies as a function of central disk surface-brightness
and exponential scale length in the B -band as pre-
dicted by our model The predicted distribution cov-
ers the full range of the observational data which in-
clude surveys of both high and low surface-brightness
galaxies and extends well beyond the limits of cur-
rent observations with no signicant fall-o in num-
 30 B-mag as2 The exis-
bers seen until 0 
tence of large numbers of LSB galaxies down to
0  25 B-mag as2 has been recognised for some
time eg Impey  Bothun 1997 and has important
consequences both for observations and for theories
of galaxy formation
The lack of small ultra-high surface-brightness
galaxies is a consequence of disk self-gravity Com-
pact self-gravitating disks are susceptible to bar in-
stabilities Efstathiou Lake  Negroponte 1982
which lead to vertical heating and the eventual de-
struction of the disk

4 SELECTION EFFECTS IN GALAXY
SURVEYS
Understanding the processes that determine the
spatial distribution of light in galaxies is important
because it is this not the total ux that primar-
ily determines whether or not a galaxy is included
in an observational sample It has been pointed out
Cross et al 2001 that a large part of the varia-
tion in measurements of the faint-end slope of the
luminosity function may be due to the dierent lim-
iting isophotes of the surveys used To test this we
created mock surveys of a 7
 7 area of sky by lay-
ing eight N-body simulation boxes end-to-end along
the line of sight and selecting galaxies with isophotal
magnitudes of Biso  25 and isophotal diameters of
diso  2 for dierent limiting isophotes In gure 2
we compare the intrinsic B -band luminosity function
of the galaxies in our simulation with the luminosity
functions derived from our mock surveys The in-
trinsic luminosity function has a faint-end slope far
steeper than any of the observational measurements
plotted in gure 2 a problem that has traditionally

trinsic luminosity function the others are the predicted
measurements for surveys with isophotal limits of top
to bottom 26 25 24 and 23 B -mag as2
been resolved by invoking strong feedback from su-
pernovae to suppress star formation in dwarf galax-
ies Our results demonstrate that if selection eects
in the observed samples are accounted for strong
feedback may no longer be necessary our ducial
model has weak feedback
In a future paper we intend to model selection ef-
fects in real galaxy surveys and show that this can re-
solve many of the discrepancies between theory and
observations
