THE EDGE-ON PERSPECTIVE OF BULGELESS SIMPLE DISK GALAXIES
Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacic 1211297-1306 2009 December
Stefan J Kautsch1
ABSTRACT
This review focuses on at and superthin galaxies These are edge-on bulgeless galaxies which
are composed of a simple stellar disk The properties of these simple disks are at the end of a
continuum that extends smoothly from bulge-dominated disk galaxies to the pure disks On average
simple disks are low-mass galaxies with low surface brightnesses blue colors and slow rotational
velocities Widely-accepted cosmological models of galaxy formation and evolution were challenged
by a relatively large observed fraction of pure disk galaxies and only very recent models can explain
the existence of simple disk galaxies This makes simple disks an optimal galaxy type for the study
of galaxy formation in a hierarchical Universe They enable us to analyze the environmental and
internal inuence on galaxy evolution to study the stability of the disks and to explain the nature
and distribution of dark matter in galaxies This review summarizes the current status of edge-on
simple disk galaxies in the Universe

1 INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY
After the Great Debate in 1920 Trimble 1995 it be-
came evident that many of the known nebulae were ex-
tragalactic systems Hubble 1926 introduced a classi-
cation scheme for extragalactic nebulae that is still the
most powerful tool today to categorize galaxy morphol-
ogy see also van den Bergh 2007 In this scheme galax-
ies of dierent morphologies can be reduced into two ba-
sic geometric manifestations stellar spheroidal ellipsoid
or stellar disk All other morphologies represent a com-
bination of spheroidal components centered in disks and
span a continuum from the spheroid-dominated early-
type galaxies E S0 Sa to the disky late-type galaxies
Sb Sc Sd Sm Im Irr Peculiar and distorted mor-
phologies are considered to be the result of interaction
processes Peiderer 1963 Toomre 1977
In the 1960s a special type of a thin and elongated
galaxy was found in various galaxy surveys Ogorodnikov
1957 1958 and Vorontsov-Velyaminov 1967 1974
were among the rst scientists who studied these needle-
shaped galaxies Fujimoto 1968 suggested that these
systems are very elongated prolate ellipsoids However
the needles would be gravitationally and kinematically
unstable systems It later became evident that these ob-
jects are bulgeless simple disk galaxies seen edge-on
Heidmann et al 1972 see also Caimmi 2007 Fig-
ure 1 shows an example of an edge-on simple disk galaxy
in contrast to a disk galaxy with bulge
Because of their appearance these galaxies are fre-
quently called at galaxies eg Karachentsev 1989
Karachentsev et al 1993 Flat galaxies are edge-on disks
that are dened to have axial ratios of the semi-major
to semi-minor axis of  7 on blue photographic plates
Karachentsev et al 1993 1999
for instance M33
would be a at galaxy when seen edge-on Almost all at
galaxies are bulgeless disks Objects with even larger ax-

bulgeless and superthin galaxies are part of the class of
simple disk galaxies which ranges from thin late-type
galaxies of morphological Hubble class Scd and later
without a bulge component2 to the thicker puy disks
of bulgeless irregular disks The Large Magellanic Cloud

and pued bulgeless disk Wyse et al 1997 This re-
view focuses on the properties and challenges related to

2 FORMATION
The formation of disk galaxies in general is believed to
be the result of the collapse of a gaseous protogalaxy
within a dark halo Eggen et al 1962 White  Rees
1978 Fall  Efstathiou 1980 Chemodynamical and an-
alytical models of disk evolution within a slowly growing
dark matter DM halo can reproduce many properties
of disk galaxies like the Milky Way Samland  Gerhard
2003 Hernandez  Cervantes-Sodi 2006 Dutton 2009
In these models a Gaussian distribution of initial con-
ditions leads to either a massive disk galaxy after an ef-
cient collapse of a low angular momentum protogalaxy
or to a low surface-brightness LSB exponential disk
out of an inecient cooling protogalaxy with high angu-
lar momentum andor lower mass Sandage et al 1970
Dalcanton et al 1997
Cosmological numerical simulations of galaxy for-
mation are challenged in forming bulgeless galaxies
known as the angular momentum problem or angular
momentum catastrophe Navarro  Benz 1991 The
simulated galaxies are too dense too small too centrally
concentrated and have lower angular momentum than
observed because subhalos in a DM halo cool too fast
which causes angular-momentum loss by dynamical fric-
tion and merging of these clumps DOnghia  Burkert
2004 Piontek  Steinmetz 2009a
Feedback pro-
cesses can suppress dramatic cooling and loss of
angular momentum Sommer-Larsen et al
Okamoto et al 2005 Robertson et al 2006 Mayer et al
2008 Scannapieco et al 2008 Modern cosmological
simulations show that it is possible to form exponential
disk galaxies
that are comparable to observations
feedback Mayer et al
by using realistic models of
2008 Piontek  Steinmetz
2009b Governato et al
However other studies claim that neither
dierent kinds of feedback DOnghia  Burkert 2004
DOnghia et al 2006 nor increased numerical resolu-
tion Kockert  Steinmetz 2007 Piontek  Steinmetz
2009a can resolve the angular momentum problem
completely Therefore the formation of simple disk
galaxies in a cosmological framework is not yet well
understood Burkert 2008 Mayer et al 2008 and
a detailed understanding of this topic is just at the
beginning
3 EVOLUTION
In the current  cold DM CDM framework of struc-
ture formation and evolution galaxies in DM halos grow
hierarchically by the absorption of smaller substructures
in sub halos Searle  Zinn 1978 White  Rees 1978
Blumenthal et al 1984 This means that disk galax-
ies have always been subject to merging and interac-
tion Almost all galaxies with present halo mass com-
parable to the Milky Way MDM  1013M Mstars 
1011M Dutton 2009 are believed to have experi-
enced a major merger ie a merger with a similar
mass partner Stewart et al 2008 Wang  Kaumann
2008 Stewart et al 20093 Major mergers cause dra-
matic morphological transformations of disk galaxies At
the upper limit a merger may cause the total destruc-
tion of the disk and the formation of a spheroidal ellip-
tical galaxy eg Toomre 1977 Barnes 1992 Gardner
2001 Cox  Loeb 2008 Massive disks can then
be rebuilt from gas deposited in a gas-rich major
merger Hammer et al 2009 Robertson  Bullock 2009
Yang et al 2009 supported by the additional accretion
of cold gas Dekel  Birnboim 2006 However these
so-called rebuilt scenarios assume that disks will be re-
formed around preexisting spheroidal bulges Steinmetz
2003 Springel  Hernquist 2005
In less violent
cases of major mergers spheroidal bulges can formed
by dynamically heated disk stars and accreted mate-
rial Aceves et al 2006 Bournaud et al 2007 Khochfar
In addition new bulge stars can be formed
from disk gas that lost its angular momentum by non-
axisymmetric distortions due to galaxy-galaxy interac-
tions Noguchi 2001 Benson et al 2004 Hopkins et al
2009a Koda et al 2009
Simple disk galaxies are low-mass systems compara-
ble to M33 with MDM  10115M Mstars  1010M
Dutton 2009 that are not subject to frequent major
merging events Stewart et al 2008 Wang  Kaumann
2008 However multiple minor mergers with partners
of mass ratios  1
3  are common for low massive galax-
ies at low redshifts Bournaud et al 2007 Bullock et al
2008 Jogee et al 2009 Stewart et al 2009 Minor
mergers heat the thin disks eg Bullock et al 2008
Kazantzidis et al 2008 2009 Purcell et al 2009
bulges grow eg Naab  Burkert 2003 DOnghia et al
2006 Bournaud et al 2007 Khochfar 2009 and could
also form an elliptical galaxy Bournaud et al 2007
Combes 2009
According to these model predic-
tions not many simple disks should have survived
the cosmological evolution
Several recent studies
Robertson et al 2006 Mayer et al 2008 Hopkins et al
2009ab Koda et al 2009 Weinzirl et al 2009 targeted
this challenge and found that low-mass and gas-rich
disk galaxiessuch as simple disksin combination with
feedback processes can prevent substantial damage dur-
ing mergers In these models the large amount of col-
lisional gas suppresses violent relaxation of the angular
momentum in the merger and subsequently conserves the
disk structure of these galaxies
However several observations of simple disk galax-
ies show signatures of galaxy-galaxy interactions For
example many simple disk galaxies show warps a
possible indicator of ongoing morphological transfor-
mations Reshetnikov 1995 Uson  Matthews 2003
Matthews  Uson 2004 It is also observed that some
simple disks host a faint and diuse thick stellar disk
component Yoachim  Dalcanton 2006 see also Sec-
tion 6 These thick disks can be formed during merging
events and contain large fractions of the stellar mass in
such galaxies Yoachim  Dalcanton 2008
Another explanation of the observed frequency of
simple disks is that they are exceptionally stable
Massive spheroidal components like bulges and DM
halos can stabilize disks against external
inuence
Samland  Gerhard 2003 Sotnikova  Rodionov 2006
3 Strictly speaking the model of hierarchical clustering HCM
implies that every structure has experienced a major merger when
its history is followed far enough in the past Khochfar  Burkert
Bulgeless Galaxies
Kazantzidis et al 2009 Simple disks have dominant
non-baryonic DM halos see Section 54 Moreover the
disk thickness Karachentsev et al 1997 of at galax-
ies also is related to the dark halo Zasov et al 2002
Kregel et al 2005 and Mosenkov et al 2010 used
samples of edge-on disk galaxies including simple disks
and found a correlation of the relative thickness of a stel-
lar disk and the relative mass of the spheroidal compo-
nent including the DM halo Nevertheless disk galaxy
evolution remains hotly debated and future papers will
contain exciting insights in this eld
Disk galaxies can be also transformed via inter-
nal secular evolution We are currently in a cos-
mological transition era where secular evolution is
becoming an important process Kormendy  Fisher
2005 Non-axisymmetric structures like bars and oval
disks support internal disk instabilities and transport
gaseous material to the disk center Kormendy 1983
Kormendy  Kennicutt 2004 see also Combes et al
1990 Subsequent central star formation forms a pseu-
dobulge with disk-like properties such as disky isophotes
when seen edge-on exponential surface brightness pro-
les and low velocity dispersion Kormendy  Fisher
2005 Fisher  Drory 2008
Bars are frequently
detected in bulgeless galaxies Matthews  Gallagher
1997 Barazza et al 2008 making simple disks poten-
tial candidates for secular evolution Flat and superthin
galaxies are ideal for studying the predictions of secular
evolution and the growth of pseudobulges because we do
not know how many low-mass disks are aected by this
internal evolution and if it is a common phenomenon in
these objects

Boker et al 2002 Goto et al 2003 Barazza et al 2008
Cameron et al 2009 The rst comprehensive search
for disk-dominated and bulgeless galaxies was initiated
by Karachentsev 1989 in order to map cosmic ows
Karachentsev used a simple but eective method to
classify these galaxies by selecting only edge-on disks
where bulges can be easily detected and the vertical
structure can be studied This work resulted in the
Flat Galaxy Catalog FGC Karachentsev et al
1993 and the Revised Flat Galaxy Catalog RFGC
Karachentsev et al 1999 These optical all-sky surveys
are supplemented by the near-infrared The 2MASS-
selected Flat Galaxy Catalog Mitronova et al 2004
Follow-up optical and HI radio observations for FGC and
RFGC galaxies are collected in Giovanelli et al 1997
Dalcanton  Bernstein 2000 Matthews  van Driel
2000 Makarov et al 2001 Mitronova et al 2005
and Huchtmeier et al 2005
Kautsch et al 2006a used the rst data release of the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS DR1 Abazajian et al
2003 in order to collect a uniform and homogeneous
catalog of edge-on disk galaxies Similar to the FGC
4 The structure of simple disks is determined by a rotation-
supported cold extended stellar disk a dominant spheroidal non-
baryonic DM halo see Section 5 and no bulge On the opposite
end of the morphological spectrum are the ellipticals with a domi-
nant hot stellar spheroid but almost without a cold disk and DM
halo Napolitano et al 2009
and RFGC Kautsch et al 2006ab selected the objects
based on axial ratio  a
b  3 angular diameter a  30
and apparent magnitude m  20 mag in the SDSS g
band within a certain color range The galaxies were
then separated into a morphological sequence ranging
from objects with bulges to bulgeless simple disks and ir-
regulars Saf Sbf Scf Scdf Sdf and Irrf f
indicates that the galaxies contain at disks seen edge-
on This automated classication is based on bulge size
and disk atness The bulge size is represented by the
light concentration index in the SDSS r band This con-
centration index is the ratio of the Petrosian radii given
in the SDSS for each object that contains 90 and 50
of the Petrosian ux in the same band respectively see
Stoughton et al 2002 for the denition of the Petrosian
parameters in the SDSS The disk atness parameter e
is the luminosity weighted mean ellipticity of the ellipti-
cal isophotes in the SDSS r band tted to each catalog
galaxy Kautsch et al 2006a5
The fraction of the simple disk class Sdf is 16
among the disk galaxies in the Kautsch et al 2006a
catalog This fraction increases to 32 if the seem-
ingly bulgeless but less strictly dened Scdf types
are included Kautsch 2009ab conrmed these frac-
tions by using the SDSS DR6 Adelman-McCarthy et al
2008 Kautsch 2009a also compared the fraction of
simple disks in the local Universe with other recent stud-
ies Karachentsev et al 1999 2004 Allen et al 2006
Kautsch et al 2006a Barazza et al 2008 Koda et al
2009 and found a simple disk fraction of 163 on aver-
age among disk galaxies This frequency shows that bul-
geless galaxies comprise a non-negligible fraction of spi-
ral galaxy systems It is possible that small and compact
bulges are obscured due to dust extinction Tus et al
2004 Driver et al 2008 However this is unlikely in
a majority of simple disks because they are observed
to be transparent and these bulges would have dier-
ent properties to those of classical bulges predicted by
theoretical models Cameron et al 2009 Field stud-
ies show that the number density of large bulgeless
galaxies is constant maybe slightly increasing at red-
shifts 0  z  1 whereas the number of galaxies with
bulges decreases at larger distances Sargent et al 2007
Domnguez-Palmero  Balcells 2009
Bulgeless galaxies are located in all environments
ranging from low to high density Kautsch et al 2005
2009 The majority of these galaxies are weakly as-
sociated with galaxy clusters and can be found in
more isolated environments comparable to galaxy groups
and the eld Kudrya et al 1997 Karachentsev 1999b
Kautsch et al 2009 Because of the low relative ve-
locities of group galaxies merging and morphological
processes that transform late-type galaxies into bulge-
dominated and spheroidal galaxies are common in the
group environment eg Barnes 1985 Kautsch et al
2008 Tran et al 2008 This implies that simple disks
either have to be stable against morphological prepro-
cessing or are located in this environment due to recent
infall

symbols above and below the y-axis label illustrate the increasing
bulge size of the galaxies along this axis The bulgeless galaxies
Scdf Sdf and Irrf exhibit lower total surface brightnesses
compared to the disk galaxies with bulges
Simple disks are not a separate morphological class
but rather at the end of a smooth continuum without
a well-dened boundary Matthews  Gallagher 1997
Kautsch et al 2006a The continuum ranges from
massive stellar disk galaxies with substantial bulges
and with high surface brightnesses to the bulgeless
galaxies with lower masses and surface brightnesses
eg Schombert et al 1992 Karachentsev et al 1993
Matthews et al 1999 Dutton 2009 Ganda et al 2009
Figures 26 illustrate these properties for dierent
edge-on galaxies Two prototypical superthin galaxies
UGC 07321 and IC 22336 are highlighted with large
cross symbols The objects in all gures represent a
randomly selected subsample in order to avoid mak-
ing the plots too crowded from the SDSS DR6 edge-on
disk galaxy collection by Kautsch 2009a These galax-
ies are matched with the Giovanelli et al 1997 and
Huchtmeier et al 2005 catalogs in order to obtain their
rotational velocities except for UGC 07321 and IC 2233
for which the kinematic information was collected from
Matthews et al 1999 and Matthews  Uson 2008a
respectively The numbers of the objects slightly vary
between the diagrams because some SDSS parameters or
kinematics are not provided for every individual galaxy
Figure 2 shows the lower total surface brightnesses of
simple disks compared to disks with bulges However
this does not mean that every simple disk is an LSB
galaxy Kautsch et al 2006a nor that every LSB galaxy
is bulgeless Bizyaev  Kajsin 2004 The previously
discussed atness parameter e in the Figures 24 is de-
rived from the SDSS image moments as shown in Kautsch
2009a The SDSS does not contain image moments for
IC 2233 because of a nearby saturated projected star
therefore I use its isophotal ellipticity as given in the
archive as a proxy for e The total surface brightness of
each galaxy in Figure 2 is derived by using the param-
eters   petroMagrho which are given in the SDSS
archive Stoughton et al 2002 rho is ve times the log-
arithm of the Petrosian radius No correction for inclina-
tion and extinction in the individual objects is applied

the rotational velocities for the sample galaxies vrot 
W50c2 Dalcanton  Bernstein 2002 Considering the
rotational velocity as a proxy for the total mass of the
objects the gure implies that at galaxies are low-mass
systems
Only a few edge-on simple disks have been studied in
detail so far Therefore I will focus on studies of LSB su-
perthin simple disks such as UGC 07321 and IC 2233
in this and the next section The results from these
prototypes are presumably valid for most of the sim-
ple disks Generally simple disks have low metallici-
ties and blue global colors Matthews  Gallagher 1997
Matthews  Uson 2008a Cameron et al 2009 which
places them in the blue cloud of galaxies Strateva et al
2001 Baldry et al 2004 Figure 4 shows the apparent
colors for dierent edge-on disk galaxy types The col-
ors are derived from the Galactic extinction corrected
Petrosian g and r magnitudes from the SDSS archive
Stoughton et al 2002 Although no inclination correc-
tion is applied edge-on galaxies with bulges appear to
be redder compared to the average color of simple disks
The color range of bulgeless disks can represent varia-
tions of the recent star-formation rates Lee at al 2009
Bulgeless Galaxies
West et al 2009 Variations in metallicities and red-
dening due to dierent dust content also can cause dif-
ferences in colors but these eects are considered to be
small because simple disks host only small amounts of
interstellar dust discussed later in this section
Simple disks are not necessarily young Many contain
old stellar populations  10 Gyrs Bergvall  Ronnback
1995 de Blok et al 1995 Matthews et al 1999 and
Matthews  Uson 2008a also nd radial color gradi-
ents in edge-on superthins with a central mix of stellar
populations of dierent ages and a very young population
in the outer disk Additionally they nd a population of
redder older stars at higher scaleheights This suggests
that the objects formed slowly in time from the inside
out and experienced vertical dynamical heating
These studies also show signatures of ongoing localized
star formation such as HII regions OB associations and
candidate supergiant populations Bergvall  Ronnback
1995 Matthews et al 1999 Matthews  Uson 2008a
The global star formation rates of the prototypical su-
perthins are UGC 07321 SFRIRAS  0006 Myr1
Matthews  Wood 2003 Uson  Matthews 2003 and
IC 2233 SFRIRAS  002 Myr1 Matthews  Uson
2008a These estimates are at the low end of ob-
served star formation rates for Sd spirals Kewley et al
2002 Therefore Matthews and coworkers conclude
that the superthin galaxies are underevolved systems in
the sense of star formation eg Matthews et al 1999
Matthews  Uson 2008a The low global star formation
rates can be explained by the HI surface density being
too low to eciently form stars eg van der Hulst et al
1993 Schombert et al 2001 and a high velocity disper-
sion of the gas that makes the disks stable against star
formation Banerjee et al 2010 Interesting future work
could be done concerning the star formation rate per
area or star-formation rates normalized to the physical
sizes of the galaxies cf Hunter  Elmegreen 2004 The
specic star formation rates of the superthins might be
also higher than the global star formation when consid-
ering the low stellar masses eg Dutton 2009 of these

Fig 6 This gure shows the rotational velocity vrot versus
the g  r color for the same random sample of Fig 2 Bulgeless
and disk-dominated systems have bluer colors and are slow rotators
compared to galaxies with bulges
lanes appear only in edge-on galaxies with bulges and
relative fast rotational velocities These authors suggest
that the galaxies with organized dust lanes are more
gravitationally unstable which leads to fragmentation
and gravitational collapse along spiral arms and sub-
sequently smaller gas scaleheights pronounced dust
lanes star formation and high surface brightnesses In
contrast the distribution of dust in edge-on simple disks
is clumpy if their rotational velocity is below vrot  120
km s1
In this case the dust has not settled into
a thin lane and therefore appears patchy and diuse
because the simple disks are gravitationally stable and
have low star-formation rates which also implies lower
metallicities and lower mass This explains the lower
total surface brightnesses and slower rotation of simple
disk galaxies compared to galaxies with bulges as shown
in Figure 5 The ideas from Dalcanton et al 2004 are
then also visible in Figure 6 more massive galaxies as
indicated by their larger rotational velocities form more
stars at earlier times and have redder present day colors
In contrast slow rotators tend to have thicker gas disks
and thus less ecient star formation and therefore
spread their star formation out over a longer time see
also Banerjee et al 2010 In this way they can remain
blue for longer times
According to the ideas in Dalcanton et al 2004 Fig-
Stefan J Kautsch
ure 6 suggests that the rotational velocity determined
by the baryonic mass and DM regulates the average star
formation history cf Kennicutt 1998 While bulges
become more common at large vrot their presence is not
necessarily related to a red galaxy color because bulge-
less galaxies can also have red colors
In other words
if a galaxy has a high rotational velocity it forms stars
quickly Dalcanton et al 2004 and so has red colors and
it is also more likely to produce a bulge Both character-
istics are tied to the rotational velocity but it remains un-
clear whether a red color and the presence of a bulge are
correlated independent of vrot The lower surface bright-
nesses of simple disks indicate that the probability for
bulge formation depends on the mass and vrot of the host
galaxy As suggested by Kautsch et al 2006a this cor-
relation can be linked to the models where internal sec-
ular disk instabilities are responsible for forming bulges
through the dependence of the Toomre Q-parameter on
disk surface density eg Immeli et al 2004
The rotation curves of edge-on simple disk galaxies
are generally at and slowly rising throughout their
stellar disk Matthews et al 1999 Mendelowitz et al
2000 Makarov et al 2001 van der Kruit et al 2001
Zackrisson et al 2006 see also Zasov  Khoperskov
2003 These solid-body rotation curves are typical
for late-type irregular galaxies making simple disks
the simplest dynamical type of disk galaxies The
rotation curves and axial ratios indicate that these
galaxies are completely DM dominated even in their
centers and are surrounded by a spherical dark
1991 Mendelowitz et al
2000 Zasov et al
Zackrisson et al 2006 Banerjee et al 2010
rotation curves are also useful to probe DM proles
in disk galaxies Numerical N-body simulations of
CDM predict central dark halo mass densities sig-
nicantly larger and cuspier than observed in LSB
simple disks corecusp problem see Navarro et al
1997 and references therein
In contrast to the
models the observations show nearly constant density

Kuzio de Naray et al 2009

The Tully-Fisher relation of edge-on simple disks can
be used for estimations of distances luminosities diam-
eters and other parameters eg Karachentsev 1991
Kudrya et al 1997 Karachentsev et al 1999c 2002
The dust corrected Tully-Fisher relation for faint and
bulgeless LSB galaxies indicates that their absolute mag-
nitudes appear to be fainter than for spirals with bulges
for a xed HI line width ie faint LSB simple disks ro-
tate faster for a predicted luminosity Kudrya et al 1997
Matthews  Wood 2001
The far end of the continuous sequence of properties is
occupied with bulgeless irregulars see Figures 26 The
main dierence is their thicker appearance The under-
lying reason for this structural dierence may be of kine-
matical origin where turbulent motion can compete with
ordered rotation because of low rotational velocities in ir-
regulars Seiden  Gerola 1979 Sung et a 1998 This
in turn leads to low surface brightnesses because more
stellar material is distributed over a wide range of disk
scale heights which produces low stellar surface densi-
ties Schombert 2006 This trend is visible in Figure 5
although the sample of irregulars is small in the present
study because of the lack of available kinematic informa-
tion for the presented objects Schombert 2006 con-
cludes that the random gas motion leads to stochastic
and slow star formation compared to coherent patterns
of star formation in atter disks see also Banerjee et al
2010 However the dierence between at disks and
puy irregulars is not understood in detail considering
that Irrf objects and at disks can have similar values
of their rotational velocity Fig 3
6 STRUCTURES IN SIMPLE DISKS
The radial surface brightness proles of edge-on sim-
ple disks are close to projected exponentials as they are
also for simple disks at other less inclined viewing an-
gles Matthews et al 1999 Boker et al 2003a Dutton
2009 The proles in some bulgeless LSB galaxies de-
crease from an exponential t in the central regions but
it is unknown whether a strong DM dominance in the
centers of the galaxies is responsible for the decit of the
stellar densities Zackrisson et al 2006
The vertical stellar structure of edge-on simple disks
can be t with a variety of proles isothermal sech2
sech or exponential proles which dier only at small
heights Matthews 2000 and references therein At
large scaleheights single proles sometimes deviate from
one-component ts which could be explained by a sec-
ond thick stellar disk component Yoachim  Dalcanton
2006 These thick disks appear to be older than
the thin disk and have distinct slower kinematics
even counterrotation Matthews 2000 Mould 2005
Yoachim  Dalcanton 2008 Whereas internal or ex-
ternal heating via dynamical friction can be responsi-
ble for the thick disk current studies favor direct ac-
cretion of the thick-disk material during minor mergers
Yoachim  Dalcanton 2008 The sample studied so far
is very small Using larger samples edge-on simple disks
may be an excellent tool to test the dierent thick-disk
formation theories
Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 and Gebhardt et al 2000
see also Ganda et al 2009 found a tight relation be-
tween the mass of supermassive black holes and the veloc-
ity dispersion of bulges in disk galaxies This relation can
be explained in a hierarchical universe where bulge and
black hole growth is a consequence of merging galaxies
Peng 2007 Wang  Kaumann 2008 In this respect
simple disk galaxies are expected to be black hole free
However there is growing evidence that this is not al-
ways true for example NGC 1042 Shields et al 2008
NGC 3621 Satyapal et al 2007 Gliozzi et al 2009
or NGC 4395 Filippenko  Ho 2003 among other sim-
ple disks Nuclear star clusters are also often found in
bulgeless galaxies Boker et al 2002 Walcher et al 2005
2006 Rossa et al 2006
7 OUTLOOK
We need studies focused on edge-on bulgeless galax-
ies independent of their surface brightnesses and other
selection criteria to investigate the properties and the
formation and evolution of simple disks Large surveys
already contain much of the needed material for such fu-
ture investigations Interesting work could be performed
by tracing the frequency and properties of simple disks
in dierent environments and redshifts in order to paint
Bulgeless Galaxies
a picture of their evolution history and progenitor sys-
tems cf Elmegreen et al 2004 A census about the
total halo stellar and gas masses would shed light on
the stability of the disks and eventually on the mystery
of the dark matter
Simple disk galaxies are ideal objects to test current
cosmological theories of the formation evolution and
morphological transformations of galaxies to explore un-
known properties of these objects and to fascinate peo-
ple in the International Year of Astronomy and beyond
