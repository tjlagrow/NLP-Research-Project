ABSTRACT
We examine the evolution of the galaxy luminosity function LF using a sample of
over 2000 galaxies with 012  z  055 and 170  Rc  215 drawn from the Cana-
dian Network for Observational Cosmology Field Galaxy Redshift Survey CNOC2 at
present the largest such sample at intermediate redshifts We use UBVRcIc photometry
and the spectral energy distributions SEDs of Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 to
classify our galaxies into early intermediate and late types for which we compute lu-
minosity functions in the rest-frame B Rc and U bandpasses In particular we adopt
a convenient parameterization of LF evolution including luminosity and number density
evolution and take care to quantify correlations among our LF evolution parameters
We also carefully measure and account for sample selection eects as functions of galaxy
magnitude and color
Our principal result is a clear quantitative separation of luminosity and density evo-
lution for dierent galaxy populations and the nding that the character of the LF
evolution is strongly dependent on galaxy type Specically we nd that the early- and
intermediate-type LFs show primarily brightening at higher redshifts and only modest

density evolution while the late-type LF is best t by strong number density increases
at higher z with little luminosity evolution We also conrm the trend seen in previ-
ous smaller z  1 samples of the contrast between the strongly increasing luminosity
density of late-type galaxies and the relatively constant luminosity density of early-type
objects Specic comparisons against the Canada-France and Autob redshift surveys
show general agreement among our LF evolution results although there remain some
detailed discrepancies
In addition we use our number count and color distribution
data to further conrm the validity of our LF evolution models to z  075 and we also
show that our results are not signicantly aected by potential systematic eects such
as surface brightness selection photometric errors or redshift incompleteness

Introduction
The luminosity function LF is a basic and fundamentally important statistic used to study
galaxy populations and their evolution In particular measurement of the eld galaxy luminosity
function at dierent redshifts provides a simple means of describing the global changes seen in the
galaxy population with lookback time These LF data together with complementary information
from galaxy number counts and color distributions among others supply some of the key obser-
vations that help shape our picture of how galaxies evolve eg see reviews by Koo  Kron 1992
Ellis 1997 It remains an important problem and a dicult theoretical challenge to properly inter-
pret the variety of galaxy evolution data including the LF in terms of models of galaxy formation
and evolution that self-consistently incorporate relevant physical processes such as star formation
feedback and gravity eg Baugh et al 1998 Cole et al 1994 Kaumann et al 1997
Recent observational progress in measuring the eld galaxy LF has spanned a very wide range
of redshifts including improved estimates using larger local z  0 and intermediate-redshift
z  1 samples as well as the rst observations for high-redshift z  3 galaxies In the local
z  02 regime the galaxy LF is now determined routinely using redshift survey samples containing
thousands of galaxies and the LF is most commonly measured for the rest-frame optical B Loveday
et al 1992 Marzke et al 1994b da Costa et al 1994 Zucca et al 1997 Ratclie et al 1998 Colless
1998 and R bands Lin et al 1996a Geller et al 1997 However despite the very large sample
sizes there remains controversy in the determination of the local LF with regard to both its
normalization and shape The controversy results from potential systematic eects which may
adversely aect LF measurements in local surveys at bright magnitudes these include surface
brightness selection eects systematic photometric errors possible local galaxy underdensities
and the small volumes over which intrinsically faint galaxies are visible see discussion and review
in Ellis 1997 The uncertainties in the local LF normalization and shape make it more dicult to
 3 
use the local results as low-redshift anchors for models of galaxy evolution Nonetheless a robust
result from local LF measurements appears to be the dependence of the LF on galaxy type in
the sense that the faint end of the LF is consistently dominated by galaxies of later morphology
Marzke et al 1994a Marzke et al 1998 later spectral type Bromley et al 1998 Colless 1998
stronger line emission Lin et al 1996a Zucca et al 1997 or bluer color Marzke  da Costa 1997
Metcalfe et al 1998
The LF situation is somewhat less controversial at intermediate redshifts 02  z  1 Recent
deep redshift surveys with samples of typically hundreds of galaxies have consistently found similar
trends in the evolution of dierent types of galaxies Lilly et al 1995b Ellis et al 1996 Cowie et
al 1996 Lin et al 1997 Heyl et al 1997 Small et al 1997 Liu et al 1998 Hogg et al 1998 de
Lapparent et al 1997 Namely there exists a distinct contrast between the rapid evolution seen
in the LF of late-type blue starforming galaxies and the relatively mild changes observed in the
LF of early-type red quiescent objects Also type-dependent LF dierences similar to those seen
at low redshifts are also observed at intermediate z The depth of the photometry required for
intermediate-redshift surveys renders them less susceptible than their local counterparts to surface
brightness selection eects and multicolor data are also typically available for moderate-redshift
samples permitting more accurate galaxy classication On the other hand the sample sizes are
smaller and the redshift completeness is not as high as for low-z surveys so that the random errors
on the luminosity function are in general larger than those for local LFs
A much larger intermediate-redshift sample will however be provided by the Canadian Net-
work for Observational Cosmology CNOC Field Galaxy Redshift Survey hereafter denoted CNOC2
The CNOC2 survey has as its primary goal the study of the evolution of galaxy clustering and galaxy
populations at intermediate redshifts 01  z  07 In order to accomplish its objectives CNOC2
will acquire some 5000 galaxy redshifts at Rc  215 thus making a dramatic improvement over
other intermediate-z surveys in terms of sample size In addition nearly all CNOC2 galaxies have
multicolor UBVRcIc photometry which is more extensive color coverage than is available for the
vast majority of other redshift surveys This multicolor information permits galaxy classications
using ts to broadband colors computed from model galaxy spectral energy distributions SEDs
Consequently luminosity functions may be calculated and studied for dierent galaxy populations
as well as for a number of dierent rest-frame bandpasses such as B Rc and U  In addition the
multicolor photometry permits more accurate computation of k-corrections and related quantities
and also allows detailed checks of the surveys redshift completeness as functions of galaxy color
and type
In this paper we will examine the evolution of the luminosity function for dierent galaxy
populations using an interim but statistically complete sample of over 2000 CNOC2 galaxies with
Rc  215 Though this is only half of the ultimate CNOC2 survey sample our interim data
set nevertheless comprises the largest intermediate-z redshift survey at present The combination
of large sample size multicolor data and careful control of redshift selection eects should allow
CNOC2 to give the best quantitative LF constraints thus far at intermediate redshifts
 4 
The outline of the paper is as follows In  2 we describe details of the CNOC2 data sample and
we will also discuss redshift success rates use of statistical weights to correct for incompleteness
and surface brightness selection eects Then in  3 we detail our methods for galaxy classications
and for tting the luminosity function and its associated evolution parameters Our LF evolution
results are described in  4 where we focus in particular on quantifying luminosity and density
evolution in the LFs of dierent galaxy populations
In addition we will also compute galaxy
SED type distributions number counts and color distributions as well as examine the impact that
various potential systematic eects may have on our LF evolution results In  5 we compare our
LFs to those derived from a number of previous intermediate-redshift galaxy surveys in particular
the two next largest samples the Canada-France Redshift Survey Lilly et al 1995ab and the
composite Autob Redshift Survey Ellis et al 1996 Heyl et al 1997 plus references therein
Finally we summarize our conclusions in  6
CNOC2 is now complete with respect to data acquisition and LF studies using the full CNOC2
sample will be forthcoming once all the data have been reduced All the presently available fully
reduced and statistically complete CNOC2 data are contained in the interim sample dened below
in  2 and this is the rst in a series of papers studying LF evolution in the CNOC2 data set
The second paper Lin et al 1999 hereafter Paper II will address LF evolution in the context
of physically-motivated galaxy evolution models In contrast in the present paper we focus on a
description of the redshift-dependent changes in the luminosity function and will not attempt to
explain those changes in terms of physical processes that is the province of Paper II We emphasize
that our use of luminosity evolution and density evolution should strictly be construed to
describe the apparent changes in the LF and may or may not correspond to true physical changes
in individual galaxies Not too surprisingly it turns out that the apparent LF evolution will be
sensitive to the details of the galaxy classication scheme and choice of SEDs as a function of
z that one adopts this will be elaborated further in  412 and in Paper II Nonetheless the
descriptive approach we take in this paper is a simple and eective way of characterizing and
quantifying the changes in the LFs of dierent intermediate-redshift galaxy populations and it is
also in essence the typical approach taken in previous LF studies
For the Hubble constant H0  100 h km s1 Mpc1 h  1 should be assumed in this paper
if the h dependence is not explicitly shown We also adopt a deceleration parameter q0  05
throughout except where otherwise specied in particular q0  01 will be used on occasion
2 The CNOC2 Survey Data
A detailed description of the CNOC2 Field Galaxy Redshift Survey will be given in Yee et al
1999 see also Yee et al 1996 1997 We summarize the relevant points here
The survey covers four widely separated areas hereafter denoted as patches on the sky In
this paper we use data from the two CNOC2 patches 022300 and 092037 named by RA and
 5 
Dec Observations for these two patches were obtained during six observing runs at the Canada-
France-Hawaii Telescope CFHT over the period February 1995 to August 1997 Both photometry
and spectroscopy were done using the CFHT Multi-Object Spectrograph MOS Each of these two
patches is a mosaic of 19 MOS elds each  9  8 covering nearly 1400 arcmin2 but see next
paragraph Each patch is roughly in the shape of the letter L with dimensions approximately 54
EW and 80 NS see Yee et al 1997
Photometry was obtained using MOS in imaging mode for ve bands approximate 5 limits
in parentheses Kron-Cousins Rc 240 and Ic 230 and Johnson B 246 V 240 and U
230 We restrict our sample to the 34 MOS elds of the 38 total in the 0223 and 0920 patches
which have full UBVRcIc coverage The sky coverage of our sample is then 2490 arcmin2 and the
comoving sample volume is 113150  105 h3 Mpc3 for q0  0501 Photometric reductions
object detection star-galaxy classication and photometry were done using an improved version
of the Picture Processing Package PPP Yee 1991 Yee et al 1996 Objects were selected in the
Rc band for the surveys spectroscopic sample and we adopt Rc  215 as the nominal spectroscopic
completeness limit see  21 below
Multislit spectroscopy was carried out on CFHT MOS We used a band-limiting lter to restrict
the wavelength coverage to 4400-6300A in order to increase the multiplexing eciency such that
typically 90-100 objects may be observed per slit mask The band-limiting lter does however
restrict the redshift range over which spectroscopic features important for redshift measurement
may be seen We adopt the nominal redshift completeness range 012  z  055 based on the
observability of the Ca II HK 3968 3933A absorption feature important for early-type galaxies
Over this same redshift range the OII 3727 emission feature important for late-type galaxies is
also observable except for z  02 where we expect OIII 5007 4959 and H 4861A emission
to substitute for the unobservable OII 3727 Spectroscopic reductions and redshift measurements
were carried out using custom-written programs and standard IRAF routines The rms error in the
velocity measurements is about 100 km s1 as determined empirically from redundant spectroscopic
observations
We correct our photometry for extinction from the Milky Way using the dust maps of Schlegel
et al 1998 We convert Schlegel et als EB  V  values to magnitudes of extinction in the
UBVRcIc bands using the procedure described in their Appendix B adopting the Milky Way
extinction curves of ODonnell 1994 and Cardelli et al 1989 The extinction variation within
each of the 0223 and 0920 patches is small so we simply apply a single correction for each patch
as a whole

21 Redshift Success Rates and Statistical Weights
For reasons of observational eciency we cannot target for spectroscopy all galaxies in our
elds and like the majority of other redshift surveys we do not successfully measure a redshift
from every spectrum We thus need to derive a set of statistical weights so that we can account
for incompleteness in the CNOC2 redshift sample for our luminosity function and other analyses
Figure 1 top left panel shows our redshift sampling rate as a function of apparent magnitude
Rc where the redshift sampling rate is dened as the fraction of galaxies with redshifts among all
galaxies in our photometric catalog The dierential redshift sampling rate is about 20 at the
nominal spectroscopic completeness limit Rc  215 and the cumulative sampling rate is about 50
for 170  Rc  215 Since we do not put a spectroscopic slit on every object the redshift sampling
rate is dierent from the redshift success rate dened as the fraction of spectroscopically observed
galaxies with redshifts Our redshift success rate is also plotted in Figure 1 middle left panel As
expected the redshift success rate declines with fainter apparent magnitude and hence decreasing
signal-to-noise ratio in our spectra The raw success rate ranges from over 90 for Rc  19 to
about 50 at Rc  215 with an overall cumulative success rate of 70 for 170  Rc  215
However this raw success rate is biased low by galaxies with redshifts outside the nominal CNOC2
012  z  055 completeness range As we will show at the end of this section we can correct
for this bias and estimate a corrected redshift success rate solely for 012  z  055 galaxies this
improves the success rate to 70 at Rc  215 and to about 85 cumulatively for 170  Rc  215
The simplest way to derive a statistical weight is just to use the inverse of the redshift sampling
rate This will be correct if at each value of Rc the spectroscopically failed objects constitute the
same population as the spectroscopically successful ones in terms of the distribution of both their
spectral types and redshifts However this will not be true in general as our ability to measure
a redshift will be a function of the spectral type and redshift of a particular galaxy For example
given an early- and a late-type galaxy with the same apparent magnitude Rc the early-type galaxy
will yield a lower signal-to-noise CNOC2 spectrum 4400-6300A because of its redder spectral
energy distribution Moreover our nite spectral window means that our redshift failures will be
biased toward objects outside of our nominal 012  z  055 completeness range We illustrate
these points by plotting in Figure 1 the redshift success rate as a function of B  Rc top right
panel and Rc  Ic middle right colors showing that there are indeed some obvious color and
hence galaxy type dependences in our success rate but note that the same observed color can
result from galaxies of somewhat dierent types spread out across a range of redshifts Note in
particular that the steep decline seen in the success rate for B  Rc  3 or Rc  Ic  1 is caused
by higher-redshift z  055 early-type galaxies whose Ca II HK features have shifted out of our
spectral window see  31 Also the success rate drops for B  Rc  1 because of lower-redshift
z  02 late-type galaxies for which the OII 3727 emission line is likewise outside the spectral
window
One way to proceed is to apply photometric redshift methods eg Sawicki Lin  Yee 1997
Connolly et al 1995 Koo 1985 on our UBVRcIc data to obtain approximate redshifts and spectral
 7 
types for all galaxies in our photometric catalog with or without spectroscopic redshifts and
subsequently derive an estimate of our spectroscopic redshift sampling rate as a function of intrinsic
galaxy type and redshift as well as of Rc However this procedure will be postponed to a future
paper analyzing the full 4-patch CNOC2 data set For the present paper we adopt a simpler but
sucient procedure and will just estimate our redshift sampling rates in joint bins of Rc B  Rc
and Rc  Ic Specically for a galaxy i which has a redshift we will dene its statistical weight Wi
the inverse of the redshift sampling rate by
N Rci B  Rci Rc  Ici
NzRci B  Rci Rc  Ici
that is just the ratio of all galaxies N to those galaxies with redshifts Nz but where both N and
Nz include only those galaxies j that lie within the following magnitude and color bounds relative
to galaxy i
Rci  Rcj  025
B  Rci  B  Rcj  025
Rc  Ici  Rc  Icj  01

This particular magnitude- and color-dependent weighting scheme does in fact account for our
somewhat complicated redshift selection eects that we obtain sensible results will be shown below
in  43 where we compare our LF-computed number counts and color distributions with the
observations Note also that we are using the sample as a whole to calculate our weights We
are thus ignoring some real eld-to-eld variations in our redshift success rate due primarily to
observational factors in particular seeing These variations need to be accounted for in galaxy
clustering analyses but should not be important for the LF analysis of this paper A more detailed
discussion of our selection eects will be found in Yee et al 1999
Next we show in Figure 1 bottom right panel the fraction of galaxies as a function of Rc
within our 012  z  055 redshift completeness range computed using the best-t evolving B-
band LF that we will obtain below in  41 This fraction peaks at about 90 at Rc  195 but
declines to about 60 at Rc  175 and Rc  215 overall the cumulative fraction is about 75
for 170  Rc  215 We can then compute as a function of Rc a corrected redshift success rate
fcorrected for 012  z  055 galaxies using
fcorrectedRc 
NobsRc  FzRc
where Nz is the number of galaxies with redshifts in the range 012  z  055 Nobs is the total
number of spectroscopically observed galaxies and Fz is the LF-derived fraction of galaxies with
012  z  055 This more relevant corrected success rate fcorrected is also plotted in Figure 1
bottom left panel where we see that the dierential rate improves to about 70 at Rc  215
and the cumulative rate increases to about 85 for 170  Rc  215 These success rates are
comparable to those obtained in other large intermediate-z surveys eg Crampton et al 1995
Ellis et al 1996 Also in  443 below we discuss the impact of any potential residual z-dependent
 8 
incompleteness on our results Finally note that fcorrected is computed for illustrative purposes only
it is not used to weight the data in any of our analyses
22 Surface Brightness Selection Eects
Unaccounted surface brightness selection eects may seriously bias calculation of the lumi-
nosity function especially for low-redshift samples with relatively shallow photometry and bright
limiting isophotes eg Ferguson  McGaugh 1995 Dalcanton 1998 Although surface brightness
selection eects are less problematic for intermediate-z surveys like CNOC2 with deeper imaging
it is nonetheless important to quantify the surveys eective surface brightness limits We do so
in Figure 2 where we plot apparent magnitude Rc vs a central aperture magnitude Rcaperture
for CNOC2 objects classied as galaxies or probable galaxies by PPP Rcaperture will serve as
our measure of the central surface brightness and the aperture used is a circle with diameter 132
corresponding to 3 pixels for our largest-pixel-size STIS2 CCD The vertical line indicates the
nominal Rc  215 spectroscopic limit and the horizontal line is our estimate of the central surface
brightness completeness limit Rcaperture  240 or 243 Rc mag arcsec2 The latter limit is
conservatively estimated as 05 mag brighter than the turnover in the number count histogram for
Rcaperture Also plotted is the track as a function of redshift for a ducial face-on exponential
disk galaxy with the Freeman 1970 central surface brightness value BAB 0  215 mag arcsec2
and an absolute magnitude MBAB  195  5 log h  M 
B The assumed seeing is a Moat prole
with 1 FWHM nearly the CNOC2 average 09 We calculate k-corrections using an Sbc galaxy
spectral energy distribution Coleman et al 1980 we have checked that using an E or Im SED
instead makes little dierence for our conclusions
The vast majority of our galaxies lie brightwards in central surface brightness relative to the
M  Freeman disk track even though we should be sensitive to lower surface brightness objects this
is very similar to what Lilly et al 1995a found in a completely analogous plot for the Canada-
France Redshift Survey Note that our Freeman disk model is a pure exponential disk only so that
the addition of a bulge component needed for a more realistic galaxy would result immediately in
a higher central surface brightness Likewise a sub-M  Freeman disk or an inclined M  Freeman
disk will also have tracks that are everywhere brighter in Rcaperture vertically below in the plot
compared to the face-on M  Freeman disk track shown These other tracks pass more centrally
through the observed galaxy distribution but the M  Freeman disk track serves as a useful central
surface brightness lower bound for the vast majority of galaxies
Given the redshift track of a particular type of galaxy our survey will be ux-limited with
respect to that galaxy type if the track rst crosses the Rc  215 vertical boundary instead of the
Rcaperture  240 horizontal boundary otherwise we will need to consider the surface brightness
limit explicitly in our analyses Figure 2 shows that we are indeed ux-limited with respect to the
M  Freeman track across the entire CNOC2 nominal redshift range 012  z  055 and since
that Freeman track is basically a lower surface brightness bound for the bulk of our galaxies we
 9 
may conclude that the Rc  215 CNOC2 photometric sample is essentially free of central surface
brightness selection eects
Also shown in Figure 2 is the track for an M  low surface brightness LSB disk galaxy with
BAB 0  240 mag arcsec2 ten times fainter than that of a Freeman disk This LSB disk crosses
our central surface brightness boundary and exits our sample by z  025 We are thus not complete
in surface brightness to this type of LSB galaxy over the full CNOC2 redshift range Nevertheless
as Figure 2 shows we should still be sensitive to galaxies with somewhat higher surface brightnesses
but still fainter than the M  Freeman track over a fairly broad range of redshift and apparent
magnitude However very few of these LSB galaxies faintwards of the M  Freeman track are
detected within our sample Hence the number of these LSB galaxies is apparently quite small
compared to that of the more normal objects to which the survey is complete We have not
attempted to check whether the number density of our LSB galaxies is quantitatively consistent
with recent results at low redshifts eg Sprayberry et al 1997 see review by Impey  Bothun
1997 as that would take us too far aeld requiring us to examine detailed issues of surface
brightness measurements LSB galaxy denitions surface brightness evolution from intermediate
to low redshifts etc We will however explore these issues in future analyses of the galaxy surface
brightness distributions in the CNOC2 sample
3 Methods
31 Galaxy Classication
We classify CNOC2 galaxies using least-squares ts of our UBVRcIc colors to those computed
from the galaxy spectral energy distributions SEDs of Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 hereafter
CWW The CWW colors are computed using lter transmission curves taken from Buser  Kurucz
1978 for UBV  and from Bessel 1990 for RcIc As shown in Figure 3 we assign numerical values
to the four CWW SEDs as follows 0  E average of the M31 bulge and M81 bulge SEDs 1
 Sbc 2  Scd 3  Im We linearly interpolate between neighboring SEDs using 50 equal steps
in the computed broadband magnitudes and also allow linear extrapolations to SED types 05
and 35 The best-tting SED type is plotted against redshift in Figure 3 for CNOC2 galaxies
with Rc  215 The galaxies are assigned to three categories Early Intermediate and Late
according to
Intermediate
050  SED type  050
050  SED type  150
150  SED type  350
Before tting we also add 005 mag to the Ic magnitudes computed from the E Sbc and Scd
SEDs but not the Im SED in order to empirically match the observed Rc  Ic colors of CNOC2
galaxies but otherwise we make no further adjustments to the CWW SEDs This is an ad hoc
procedure and may be symptomatic of a general limitation of the CWW SED set specically that
 10 
they are based on a very small number of observed local galaxies which should not be expected to
represent the full galaxy population in every exacting detail However lacking a better SED set we
nonetheless choose the CWW set for simplicity and note that aside from the above exception the
CWW galaxy colors do give a reasonable match to the observed CNOC2 galaxy colors In  412
we will discuss the general implications of the particular choice of SED set and classication scheme
on our galaxy evolution results We also do not attempt to t for dust extinction in the CNOC2
galaxies themselves though we do correct for Milky Way extinction as described in  2 this will
be addressed instead in Paper II
Note that our SED types are stellar population types derived from broadband galaxy col-
ors and would be more closely related to classications derived from galaxy spectra than from
galaxy morphologies We stress that our galaxy SED types are not and should not be interpreted as
morphological types Of course there are correlations between galaxy types derived separately from
colors spectra and morphologies we postpone an examination of the similarities and dierences
among these various classication schemes to future CNOC2 papers
The visual impression from Figure 3 is that there are no obvious type- or redshift-dependent
incompletenesses except for the lack of galaxies earlier than Sbc at redshifts z  06 Ca II HK
redshifts out of our spectral window 4400-6300A and the dearth of intermediate-type galaxies at
z  005 both cases are outside our redshift completeness range 012  z  055 Also there
are no redshifts at z  07 because OII 3727 redshifts beyond the red end of our spectra The
exceptions are a handful of higher-z AGNsQSOs that are excluded from our analysis and are not
plotted Figure 4 compares the B  Rc Rc  Ic V  Rc and U  Rc colors observed for CNOC2
galaxies with those computed from the CWW SEDs showing that the SEDs do indeed span the
range of actual galaxy colors
We will compute absolute magnitudes k-corrections and other needed quantities using the
best-tting interpolated or extrapolated CWW SED for each individual galaxy Note in particular
that the absolute magnitudes we use in B Rc or U  are calculated directly from the best-tting
SED thus making full use of the available UBVRcIc data rather than from any single apparent
magnitude For example the U absolute magnitude would not be derived by adding 25 5 log dL
and a k-correction to the U apparent magnitude
instead we would calculate the U absolute
magnitude by direct integration of the best-t SED convolved with the U -band lter response
function
32 Computing the LF
We compute the luminosity function using standard maximum-likelihood methods Sandage
Tammann  Yahil 1979 Efstathiou Ellis  Peterson 1988 hereafter EEP which are unbiased by
density inhomogeneities in the galaxy distribution Our procedure essentially follows that given in
Lin et al 1996a 1997 and is only summarized briey here except that we will describe in more
 11 
detail our present methods for parameterizing and tting the evolution of the luminosity function
Given a survey of N galaxies at redshifts zi we form the likelihood L for those galaxies to
possess their observed absolute magnitudes Mi
lnL  ln pM1     MNz1     zN  
Wi ln pi  constant 
Here Wi is the weight described previously in  21 and pi is the individual conditional probability
pi  pMizi  MiZ minMmaxzM2
maxMminzM1
M dM 
where M1 and M2 are the global absolute magnitude limits we impose on the sample M1  Mi 
M2 Mmin and Mmax are the absolute magnitude limits at zi that correspond to the surveys
apparent magnitude limits and M  is the dierential luminosity function whose parameters we
determine by maximizing lnL
For the form of M  we adopt the usual Schechter 1976 parameterization
M   04 ln 10  1004M M 1 exp1004M M  
with characteristic magnitude M  faint-end slope  and normalization  We also use the
nonparametric steps function of EEP
M   k  Mk  M2  M  Mk  M2  k  1     Np 
which we refer to hereafter as the SWML stepwise maximum likelihood LF The details for
computing M  via maximum likelihood and for estimating errors are as given in EEP and Lin
et al 1996a 1997
To parameterize evolution in the luminosity function we adopt the following simple model for
the redshift dependence of the Schechter parameters
M z  M 0  Qz
 M z  03  Qz  03
z  0
z  01004P z 
We thus take M  to vary linearly with redshift at a rate quantied by Q which we call the M 
or luminosity evolution parameter Note that we will t for M z  03 since this is a better
constrained quantity than M 0 given the mean redshift z  03 for CNOC2 galaxies We also
make the null assumption that  does not change with redshift so that the shape of the LF stays
the same Since  is xed the normalization parameter  and the total galaxy number density
  R M dM are essentially equivalent We then take  to vary with z as determined by the
density evolution parameter P dened above The expression for  in equation 10 is chosen for

convenience so that the luminosity density L  R LM dM where L  1004M  may be written
Lz  L01004P Qz 
where P  Q then measures the linear rate of evolution of L with redshift Also note that  as
dened above may be approximated by z  01  P z so that P is merely the coecient of
the linear term in the expansion of  in powers of z
We rst estimate M z  03  and Q together using the usual maximum likelihood method
and by design this is independent of density uctuations or density evolution so that both 0
and P have to be determined separately beginning with P  In the case of a non-evolving LF it is
possible to derive maximum-likelihood estimates of z without prior knowledge of the luminosity
function Saunders et al 1990 Loveday et al 1992 Fisher et al 1992 This is completely analogous
to the case above where we may estimate M  and  independently of galaxy density variations For
the more general evolving LF dened above we may still determine P without knowing M z  03
or  but not without rst knowing Q Given a value of Q we may convert an observed absolute
magnitude Mi at z  zi to an evolution-corrected absolute magnitude at some ducial redshift say
z  0 the actual redshift does not matter Mi0  Mizi  Qzi Then with any given Q and
the resulting set of Mi0 we compute the likelihood that those galaxies will have their observed

That is we sum over the luminosities of our observed galaxies but weighted by the factor SLz
which uses the luminosity function  to extrapolate for the luminosity of unobserved galaxies lying
outside the accessible survey ux limits Also we will express L in units of h W Hz1 Mpc3
using the conversion given in Lilly et al 1996 specically one MBAB  195  5 log h galaxy
per Mpc3 produces a luminosity density of 285  1021 h2 W Hz1 Mpc3
Finally we estimate uncertainties in L and 0 using both bootstrap resampling and an
estimate of the uncertainty contributed by galaxy density uctuations We apply bootstrap re-
sampling eg Barrow et al 1984 to the full photometric sample not just to those galaxies with
redshifts re-calculate statistical weights Wi as in  21 anew for galaxies with redshifts in each
bootstrap resample and then re-t our LF evolution model and re-compute luminosity densities
This process should account for the uncertainties in 0 and Lz contributed by sampling and
weighting uctuations and by our tting procedure This does not account for the additional un-
certainty arising from galaxy density uctuations which we estimate instead using an integral over
the galaxy clustering power spectrum P k see  3 of Lin et al 1997 for details For P k we
adopt the local result from the Las Campanas Redshift Survey Lin et al 1996b eqs 2324 but
adjusted only for the linear clustering evolution at the higher redshifts sampled in CNOC2 this
is done as appropriate for both the q0  05 and 01 cosmologies we consider We then take the
overall error on 0 and L to be the quadrature sum of the bootstrap resampling and density
uctuation error contributions
4 Results
41 Evolution of the BAB-band LF
We apply the LF tting methods and evolution model of  32 to our nominally complete
170  Rc  215 sample subdivided into early intermediate and late galaxy types as described in
 31 The sample details and t parameters are given in Table 1 We rst concentrate on our LF
 14 
results in the B band shown in Figure 5 for the three galaxy types and for each of three redshift
bins in the range 012  z  055 For ease of comparison against previous surveys we will report
our B-band LF results in the AB system Oke 1972 using the transformation BAB  B  014
Fukugita et al 1995 The points in the gure show the nonparametric SWML LF estimates in
each individual type-redshift bin while the solid lines indicate the results of our 5-parameter LF
evolution model M z  03  0 P  and Q t to the full redshift completeness range
012  z  055 for each of the three galaxy types Figure 5 should allow us to judge how well our
parametric LF model matches the nonparametric LF estimates which we obtained without making
any assumptions about the form that the LF evolution takes
411 Some Technical Considerations
There are however a number of subtleties involved in comparing the SWML LF estimates k
to the parametric evolving LF estimate M z The nonparametric k are binned in both M and
z while the parametric M z is not and it may be unclear at what redshift we should evaluate
M z in order to compare against the k For example a simple procedure such as plotting the
parametric LF models evaluated at the average redshift of each redshift bin in Figure 5 will actually
result in noticeable discrepancies at the bright and faint ends of the LF when compared against
the k even when there should be none The proper thing to do is actually to calculate a weighted
average of M z over the appropriate intervals in M and z Specically we follow a procedure
given by EEP but modied for our sample We note rst that in general k 6 M  Mk even in
the absence of LF evolution As shown by EEP in their equation 215 the k are actually related
to the parametric M  by a weighted integral over M  where the weights are just the expected
number N M  of galaxies of absolute magnitude M observable by the survey In the limit that the
bin size M  0 and with no evolution k would indeed converge to M  Mk For CNOC2
we need to modify EEPs original equation 215 to account for our use of an evolving LF as well
as for cosmological and k-correction eects important for our intermediate-z sample Specically
for an absolute magnitude bin Mk  M2  M  Mk  M2 and a redshift bin z1  z  z2

where dN

z and zminM  and zmaxM  are the minimum and maximum redshift respectively at which
a galaxy of absolute magnitude M may be seen given our surveys apparent magnitude limits
and cosmological and k-correction eects The parametric LF estimates we plot in Figure 5 and
elsewhere are those given by Equation 19 this is the right way to compare our parametric LF ts
against the directly-computed nonparametric SWML estimates
In addition in Figure 5 we also show low-redshift ducial LFs dotted curves to facilitate
comparison from one redshift bin to another For this purpose we use M z  0175 ie 
evaluated at nearly the average redshift of the lowest-z bin but appropriately averaged using
Equation 19 over the higher-redshift intervals Also to facilitate bin-to-bin comparisons we show
extrapolations dashed curves of the parametric LFs faintwards of the faintest absolute magnitude
accessible in each redshift bin For this purpose we simply choose M z  z1  z22 ie 
evaluated at the average redshift of the bin since parametrick dened above is zero at these
magnitudes no galaxies observable there Note the slight disconnections between the solid and
dashed curves for the late-type parametric LFs in the two highest-z bins in Figure 5 these are
articial and are examples of the noticeable discrepancies mentioned above
For clarity in seeing the evolution trends we have purposefully matched the normalizations of
the SWML and parametric LF ts in each redshift bin of Figure 5 Specically we set
kV Mk 
parametrickV Mk 
where V Mk is the volume within the redshift limits of each bin over which a galaxy of absolute
magnitude Mk may be seen in our survey We do this to take out the eects of strong density
uctuations present in the survey clearly seen in the weighted redshift histograms shown in
Figure 6 left panels particularly for early- and intermediate-type galaxies in the 025  z  04
bin Note from Figure 6 right panels that the ratio of actual to LF-computed redshift distributions
are reasonably centered on unity and do not show conspicuous systematic trends with redshift
indicating that the normalization 0 and the number density evolution parameter P in our ts
are indeed good matches to the data To construct the galaxy redshift histograms we have rst
weighted each galaxy by Wi to correct for redshift incompleteness this makes construction of the
corresponding LF-computed redshift histogram much simpler since we are then freed from modeling
the somewhat complicated magnitude- and color-dependent selection eects of our survey
412 Description of the LF Evolution
Setting the above technical considerations aside and returning to Figure 5 we may note that
our LF model does indeed appear to be a reasonable description of the data as seen in the good
agreement between the parametric and nonparametric SWML ts but recall we have matched their
normalizations so that we are really only assessing the validity of the M   and Q parameters
 16 
The comparison also shows that our simple assumption of a xed  is quite reasonable though
of course at higher redshifts it becomes increasingly dicult to constrain the faint-end slope of
the luminosity function Note also that our xed- result diers from that found in the Autob
Redshift Survey Ellis et al 1996 Heyl et al 1997 see  53 below
Figure 5 also shows that the three galaxy types have conspicuously dierent LFs with faint-
end slopes  steepening from   01 for early types to   12 for late types Table 1
These clear LF dierences are indeed signicant as shown in Figure 7 top panel where we see
non-overlapping or barely-touching 2 error contours in M z  03 and  for the three galaxy
Figure 5 demonstrates that the LFs for all three galaxy types do indeed evolve The impression
is that the early- and intermediate-type LFs are not changing much in number density but are
rather brightening in M  at higher redshifts For the late-type LF it is harder to discern visually
because of the steepness of the LF whether the denite changes seen result from increasing
number density brightening M  or a combination of the two We can isolate the luminosity
evolution component of the LFs by rescaling the dotted ducial z  0175 LF in each panel by
the factor 1004P z1z220175 to explicitly take out the eect of the number density evolution
parameter P  We do this in Figure 8 where we conrm our earlier impression that the early- and
intermediate-type LFs are evolving primarily in M  In contrast the rescaled low-z ducial late-
type LF is a good match to the results in the two higher-redshift bins indicating that the observed
late-type LF evolution seen before in Figure 5 is driven primarily by number density changes Note
that an apparent change in number density does not necessarily imply mergers changes in the star
formation duty cycle for late-type galaxies may also mimic the eect of true mergers
Now an important consideration mentioned in the Introduction needs to be kept in mind
namely the sensitivity of the LF evolution results to the precise choice of SEDs used to classify
galaxies In particular the present choice of non-evolving CWW SEDs obviously does not account
for the evolution of the colors of galaxies with time so that during the course of its evolution
a particular galaxy may actually cross the type boundaries we have dened It is thus better to
use more physically motivated evolving galaxy SEDs eg produced by models such as those of
Bruzual  Charlot 1996 to properly track the paths dierent galaxies may take in the space of
redshift vs color Not surprisingly the resulting galaxy classications will in general dier from
the ones we make based on the CWW SEDs and importantly the conclusions we draw on the
rates of luminosity and density evolution for dierent galaxy populations will also be dierent in
general However there are a myriad of possible evolving SEDs that one may choose by varying
parameters such as star formation history stellar initial mass function epoch of galaxy formation
metallicity dust content and others so that there is no unique set of SEDs that one should
obviously pick a priori In LF Paper II we will examine evolution in the CNOC2 sample using
these physically motivated evolving galaxy SED models In the present paper though we will use
only the non-evolving CWW SEDs for galaxy classication Thus the LF evolution constraints we
derive here should strictly be considered as descriptions of galaxy evolution within the framework
 17 
of non-evolving SEDs rather than as explanations of galaxy evolution in terms of more physically
motivated processes In other words we are using the terms luminosity evolution and density
evolution purely to describe the changes in the LFs of the galaxy populations we have dened
and those terms may not correspond to the true evolutionary processes those galaxies are actually
undergoing
The latter is not precluded though As we will nd in Paper II the luminosity
evolution we see in early and intermediate galaxies still holds true when we use physically-motivated
evolving SEDs
Also we caution that the LF constraints will be weaker and the errors larger when our LF
models are extrapolated outside the nominal CNOC2 redshift limits For example the errors
are approximately doubled for M z  0 compared to M z  03 specically M z  0 
1858  0231911  034 and 1920  035 for early- intermediate- and late-type galaxies
respectively There are only about 200 galaxies in our LF sample with 012  z  02 to constrain
the lowest-z behavior of our LF evolution model These galaxies alone do in fact give an overall
best t M 
 195 and   09 in reasonable agreement with results from much larger local
redshift samples eg Loveday et al 1992 and our M z  0 and  values for intermediate-
and late-type galaxies are also in good agreement with local results eg Figure 8 of Colless 1998
However our early-type LF may have a fainter M z  0 and shallower  compared to local
values eg Colless 1998 but cf also Bromley et al 1998 In future work we will compare in more
careful detail our results with those of large local surveys in order to further check the validity of
extrapolations of our LF models see also  43 and 52
Keeping the above caveats in mind our impression so far is that evolution in early- and
intermediate-type galaxies is dominated by brightening in M  at higher z while the evolution in
late-type galaxies is caused by increasing number densities at higher redshifts This impression is
borne out in the P vs Q error contours shown in Figure 9 early and intermediate types show
positive luminosity evolution with a combined Q  13 but little density evolution P  03
while late types show strong positive density evolution P  31 but little M  evolution with
Q  02 Table 1 However Figure 9 also shows that we need to be somewhat cautious and keep
the correlated nature and fairly large size of the P -Q error contours in mind Not surprisingly
our ability to decouple density and luminosity evolution depends on the shape of the luminosity
function
for early and intermediate types the LF has a shallow  and a conspicuous knee
near M  while for late types the LF is steep and it becomes correspondingly harder to measure
subtle changes in M  with redshift Thus although the late-type sample is the largest among the
three types the late-type P -Q contour is the most elongated and the most dicult one for which
to separately constrain density and luminosity evolution Moreover even for the two earlier-type
samples no-evolution P  0 Q  0 is ruled out at only somewhat better than the 2 level
Nonetheless it does appear to be a fairly robust conclusion from Figure 9 that late types occupy
a dierent region of P -Q parameter space than early and intermediate types so that the form of
the LF evolution of late-types is distinct from that of early- and intermediate-type galaxies
 18 
413 Evolution of the Luminosity Density
Despite the diculties in decoupling P and Q we can nevertheless robustly constrain the sum
P  Q which measures the rate of evolution of the rest-frame luminosity density Lz The error
contours in Figure 9 are elongated roughly along lines of constant P  Q and thus compressed in
the orthogonal direction so that the contours are actually most eective for constraining the sum
as opposed to P and Q separately The luminosity density of late types evolves at a signicantly
more rapid rate P  Q  33 than that of early and intermediate types P  Q  05 and 16
respectively This is shown in more detail in Figure 10 where we plot Lz for the 3 galaxy
types individually as well as summed together We also tabulate our luminosity density results in
Table 3 Clearly the late-type population shows the most strongly increasing Lz while the early
and intermediate types show much milder increases at higher redshift Note that the luminosity
densities for the three types are roughly equal at z  01 but by z  055 late-type galaxies
predominate and account for over half of the total luminosity density Also shown in Figure 10 are
the separate contributions to Lz from the luminosity and number density evolution components
for each of the three galaxy types Compared to the P -Q plot or even the LF plots the curves for
these individual components most clearly illustrate the dierent LF evolution trends we discussed
earlier but keeping the caveats in mind The late-type galaxy LF is dominated by strong density
evolution with nearly no luminosity evolution The intermediate-type LF shows positive luminosity
evolution plus weak positive density evolution resulting in mild positive evolution in L The
early-type LF shows positive luminosity evolution which is nearly compensated by negative density
evolution yielding a very weak positive evolution in the luminosity density
These general conclusions are not altered much by adopting a q0  01 instead of a q0  05
cosmology Our q0  01 results are also tabulated in Tables 1 and 3 and the corresponding P -Q
contours and Lz plots are shown in Figures 11 and 12 respectively To rst order absolute
magnitudes change with q0 as M z q0  M z q0  05  q0  05z and the dierential volume
element varies as dV
dz z q0  051  2q0  05z We thus expect Q  04
P  08 and P  Q  04 in going from q0  05 to q0  01 and indeed that is what
we approximately nd quantitatively Qualitatively this means more positive luminosity evolution
but more negative number density and luminosity density evolution In particular no-evolution
P  Q  0 for the early and intermediate types combined may be ruled out at higher signicance
than was possible for the q0  05 case Otherwise though the general LF evolution trends follow
those for the q0  05 cosmology
dz z q0  dV
Finally in this subsection we make the most minimal assumptions and t the LF for the three
galaxy types with non-evolving Schechter functions and compare the resulting trends of luminosity
density vs redshift against those obtained from the evolving models above this is done in Figure 13
for q0  05 only Reassuringly we nd that the actual trend of L with redshift the points in the
gure not the curves is insensitive to whether we use non-evolving or evolving LFs in eqs 16
and 17 The late-type L always rises sharply compared to the weak increases observed for the
earlier types However as seen in the top two panels of Figure 13 a constant L as required by
 19 
a non-evolving LF is clearly a bad description of the late-type Lz and consequently for the
total Lz as well since late types make up the greatest contribution On the other hand a non-
evolving constant Lz does seem to be reasonable for the two earlier types This is not surprising
as Figure 9 shows that although an evolving LF is preferred by the data a non-evolving LF is ruled
out at only about 2 for early and intermediate galaxies A larger data set will be needed in order
to make a stronger statement regarding no-evolution vs evolution and the doubled size of the nal
CNOC2 sample should allow signicantly improved constraints on these early- and intermediate-
type galaxies In addition we are also calibrating photometric redshifts using the multicolor data for
our spectroscopic-redshift sample Application of photometric redshifts to those CNOC2 galaxies
without spectroscopic redshifts should provide another factor of two increase in the number of
Rc  215 galaxies that may be used in our LF studies thereby allowing further improvements in
our evolution constraints
42 The Rc- and U -band LFs
The availability of UBVRcIc colors in conjunction with the CWW SED types makes it a
straightforward matter to calculate the appropriate k-corrections and derive the LF in bands other
than B the most typical choice We do so for the Rc and U bands No extrapolations are required
of our color data to derive rest-frame U magnitudes Although extrapolations are required to
obtain rest-frame Rc magnitudes the needed k-corrections are not large  1 mag and are well-
constrained by the SED classications Note that here we are always using a 170  Rc  215
sample we are not varying the band used for galaxy selection not until  45 and 53 below
The best-t Rc and U LF and evolution parameters are given in Table 2 and the luminosity
densities are given in Table 3 The Rc- and U -band LFs themselves will not be plotted since those
gures would look very similar to Figure 5 for the BAB LFs Essentially the same trends observed
earlier for the BAB LFs are seen for Rc and U as well and our earlier discussion applies We also
nd that the best-t faint-end slopes  are independent of band For all three galaxy types the
full range in best-t  values is only about 02 among the three bands BAB Rc and U  Thus to
convert the LF results from one band to another it is a good approximation to keep  xed and
just apply an appropriate oset in M  based on the mean rest-frame color for that galaxy type
Moreover it also turns out that the evolution parameters Q and P agree well from band to band
In retrospect this is not surprising We expect that Q should stay the same because our galaxy
classication scheme is based on selecting galaxies of similar rest-frame colors at dierent redshifts
For example however much the average MB changes with redshift for our early-type galaxies MR
for those same galaxies should change by about the same amount since by denition the rest-frame
color MB  MR of our early-type galaxies needs to stay about constant with redshift Thus for
populations of similar rest-frame color Q and subsequently P will be approximately independent
of which band is chosen for the LF
However although the rate P  Q of luminosity density evolution for a particular galaxy type
 20 
is similar in dierent bands the normalization Lz  0 is in general dierent This makes the
overall evolution of L somewhat dierent for the dierent bands and Figure 14 compares Lz
for the three bands including subdivision by galaxy type For Rc and U  we have rst applied AB
corrections RcAB  Rc  0169 and UAB  U  069 Fukugita et al 1995 before applying the
same conversion we used for BAB to convert to h W Hz1 Mpc3 units see end of  32 The
relative contribution of late-type galaxies is strongest for U and weakest for Rc and vice versa for
early-type galaxies as expected This causes the total L to increase with redshift at a somewhat
faster rate in U than in Rc but Figure 14 upper left panel shows that the dierence is not very
strong at least over the CNOC2 redshift range
43 SED Type Distributions Number Counts and Color Distributions
So far we have not explicitly needed the distribution of SED types but in order to obtain
the LF-computed galaxy number counts and color distributions the SED type distribution will be
helpful Otherwise we will have to make some ad hoc assumptions eg a uniform type distribution
within each of the three galaxy categories or delta functions at a number of characteristic SED
types We rst dene an overall fractional type distribution F in bins of SED type t by
F t1  t  t2  Xt1tit2
WiSjzi Xall galaxies
WiSjzi
Here we are weighting by the usual statistical weights Wi as well as by the appropriate selection
function Sjzi from equation 15 where j  early intermediate or late indicates the category to
which galaxy i belongs The inverse selection function weighting corrects F t to what one would
obtain for a volume-limited sample with 22  MBAB  5 log h  16 and there is also an implicit
assumption that the LF is independent of SED type t within each of the three galaxy categories
Also because the LF evolves F t will change with redshift but for illustrative purposes we will
neglect this complication and simply plot in Figure 15 the F t computed over the full redshift
completeness range 012  z  055 In our number count and color distribution calculations we
actually only need the fractional distribution Gjt within each of the three galaxy categories j
Gjt1  t  t2 
t1tit2  galaxy i in category j
WiSjzi
all galaxies in category j
WiSjzi  22
We have explicitly checked that Gj changes only weakly with redshift so that it is a good approx-
imation to adopt the Gj computed for the full redshift range 012  z  055 in our subsequent
calculations Note that the appearance of the histogram in Figure 15 the presence of peaks and
valleys how smooth or not it appears may depend to some extent upon the choice of the set of
original SEDs used to dene the classication scheme
We now consider the CNOC2 photometric sample with Rc  215 the nominal spectroscopic
limit The galaxy number counts in the UBVRcIc bands for this sample are plotted in Figure 16
 21 
Note the turnover at faint magnitudes in the UBV Ic bands is due to our explicit Rc  215 cut
and is not a result of incompleteness in the photometry in these bands We also plot the number
counts computed using the evolving BAB-band LFs jM z and the fractional distributions Gjt
derived previously In particular galaxies with redshifts z1  z  z2 will contribute to the number
counts N in an apparent magnitude interval m1  m  m2 of a particular band according to
N m1  m  m2 z1  z  z2  Xj Xt
GjtZ z2
z1 cid18 dV
dz cid19 dzZ Mmaxzm2t
Mminzm1t
jM zdM 
where Mminz m1 t and Mmaxz m2 t are the absolute magnitude limits observable at redshift
z given the apparent magnitude limits m1 and m2 and the k-corrections connecting absolute BAB
magnitudes to the apparent magnitudes for the band in question These k-corrections depend on
the galaxy type t and are calculated using our usual CWW SEDs Also in the second sum above
Gj is evaluated using bins of width t  02 as in Figure 15 We calculate N rst considering
only the contribution of galaxies with 012  z  055 the nominal redshift completeness range
adopted for the LF analysis We can clearly see the shortfall compared to the actual counts at both
bright and faint magnitudes resulting from neglect of low- and and high-z galaxies respectively
The match between the observed and LF-computed counts is much improved by extending the
redshift range to 0  z  075 and further extension to 0  z  1 makes little dierence The good
agreement seen is not a circular result since the LF is t only for galaxies within 012  z  055
so that including the LF-extrapolated contribution from galaxies outside that redshift range serves
as an independent check on the validity of our LF and evolution models
We then repeat the same exercise but using various color distributions as shown in Figure 17
The LF-computed color distributions are calculated using an expression analogous to equation 23
but augmented with the appropriate limits in the observed colors The LF-computed results again
converge by z  075 and the match to the observed color distributions is good for all four colors
shown B  Rc Rc  Ic V  Rc and U  Rc We should recall here that we did adjust the
CWW SED Ic magnitudes to improve the match to the Rc Ic distribution as mentioned in  31
The overall reasonable agreement between the 0  z  1 LF-computed color distributions and the
observed distributions provides further validation of our evolving LF model and of our magnitude-
and color-dependent weighting scheme dened back in  21
44 Potential Systematic Eects
Here we will consider a number of potentially important systematic sources of error which may
aect our LF and evolution ts specically 1 dierences between the 0223 and 0920 patches
2 random photometric errors 3 potential redshift incompleteness and 4 potential apparent
magnitude incompleteness We will nd that typically our LF and evolution parameters are biased
at less than the 1 level
 22 
441 Patch-to-Patch Variation
Since there are large-scale density uctuations in our survey Figure 6 we should check how
well our results for the 0223 and 0920 patches agree We do so in some detail comparing the M -
Figure 7 and P -Q error contours as well as the trend of Lz by galaxy type Encouragingly
the LF parameters M   P  and Q for the two patches are all consistent within their respective
2 error contours Examination of the Lz comparison shows excellent agreement of the LF-
computed luminosity density evolution trends for all three galaxy types despite the obvious density
uctuations seen in both patches
442 Random Photometric Errors
Random photometric errors will in general cause an Eddington-type eect on the LF such that
M  is biased brighter and  is biased steeper see EEP This eect is appreciable for photographic-
plate-based surveys with magnitude errors m  03 mag eg Loveday et al 1992 Marzke et al
1994b but is essentially negligible for CCD-based surveys with magnitude errors m  01 mag
eg Lin et al 1996a though one can correct for it nonetheless by taking the LF to be a Schechter
function convolved with a Gaussian magnitude error distribution with dispersion m see EEP For
CNOC2 Rc  01 mag at the nominal Rc  215 spectroscopic limit and the consequent eects
on M  and  should be small However we should also conrm that the impact of photometric
errors are likewise negligible for the P and Q evolution parameters Moreover since our galaxy
classications and consequent derivation of k-corrections and absolute magnitudes also make use
of the UBVIc magnitudes apart from just Rc the photometric error distributions in these various
bands will aect our derivation of the LF and evolution parameters in a complicated way The
median magnitude errors for our Rc  215 galaxies are 004 mag for Rc and Ic 005 mag for V  008
mag for B and 016 mag for U  One could estimate the potential biases by tting the LFs of Monte
Carlo mock CNOC2 galaxy catalogs generated using the best-t type-dependent LF and evolution
parameters of the real sample combined with the appropriate photometric error distributions in
each of the CNOC2 bands We will however use a less complicated procedure and simply see what
happens if we articially increase the photometric errors of the real CNOC2 sample Specically
for each photometric band of each galaxy we modify the observed magnitude by adding a random
magnitude error The random magnitude error is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero
mean and with dispersion equal to the PPP-estimated magnitude error for that particular band
and galaxy The photometric errors appropriate for the modied magnitudes are thus 2 times
the original estimated errors We repeat this procedure ve independent times for each galaxy in
the full CNOC2 photometric sample so we end up with a ve-fold larger error-boosted sample
Galaxy classications and statistical weights are then computed using the same procedure as for
the original sample but now based on the modied magnitudes and we then re-t for the LF and
evolution parameters The biases in the tted parameters of the error-boosted sample relative
to the original CNOC2 sample give us an estimate of the biases inherent in the CNOC2 sample
 23 
relative to a hypothetical sample with no photometric errors Our error-boosted P and Q values
are plotted as solid points in Figure 18 upper left panel and are within the 1 error contours
of the original P -Q values Likewise the error-boosted M  and  values not plotted are also
within about 1 of the original values but systematically biased bright or steep as expected We
thus conclude that the existing photometric errors of our sample do not signicantly bias our LF
and evolution parameter ts
443 Redshift Incompleteness
As described in  2 our nominal redshift limits z  012 and 055 are set by the observability of
important absorption and emission features over the 4400-6300A spectroscopic range Examination
of Figure 6 shows that as expected the observed weighted redshift distribution outside the
012  z  055 range tends to lie low compared to the distribution from the best-t LF model
although the eect is primarily seen for early and intermediate types at higher redshifts compare
also Figures 3 and 4 However in the highest-z bin 05  z  055 within our nominal redshift
range there is already a noticeable dip in the redshift distributions for early and intermediate
galaxies This perhaps indicates some unaccounted residual redshift incompleteness in that bin
and we should check what happens if we exclude that bin from our analysis Also we note that
the 01  z  02 bins may suer from incompleteness in late-type galaxies if H and OIII
50074959 do not adequately pick up for the unobservable OII 3727 line
Thus we redo our ts for the more redshift-complete range 02  z  05 over which the most
important redshift-identication features Ca II HK and OII 3727 are always observable We in
fact nd M  and  values to be in good agreement with the original ones and as shown in Figure 18
top right panel the P and Q parameters agree within  15 of the original values It thus appears
that our LF parameters are not signicantly biased by any residual redshift incompleteness eects
even though there are some possible hints of incompleteness in the 05  z  055 bin for early-
and intermediate-type galaxies
444 Apparent Magnitude Incompleteness
As shown in Figure 1 and discussed in  21 the uncorrected raw dierential redshift success
rate at the nominal spectroscopic limit Rc  215 is 05 and the redshift sampling rate is 02 so that
the typical galaxy weight is about 5 Here we check if using a 05 mag brighter limit of Rc  210
where there is an improved raw redshift success rate of 06 and a smaller typical galaxy weight
of about 2 will make a signicant dierence in the LF evolution results Figure 18 bottom left
shows that the P and Q values for the 170  Rc  210 sample are always within the original 1
contours Likewise the M  and  values are within the original 2 contours We thus conclude
that potential unaccounted incompleteness over the 210  Rc  215 magnitude range does not
make a signicant dierence to our results
 24 
45 B-band Selection
Here we examine the eects of using a B-selected CNOC2 sample compared to our usual Rc-
selected sample We do this partly in anticipation of our later comparison with the B-selected
Autob Redshift Survey in  53 We dene a 18  B  23 CNOC2 sample N  1936 and
compute new weights using the bound Bi  Bj  025 in place of the corresponding Rc bound in
equation 3 The B-selected P -Q results are shown in Figure 18 bottom right panel where we
nd agreement within 2 with the Rc-selected results except for the early-type galaxies which now
show weak positive density evolution P  06 In general the B-selected sample shows more positive
density evolution compared to the Rc-selected sample but the luminosity evolution parameters Q
are very similar The corresponding M  and  values agree well within 1 for the early and
intermediate types and are within 2 for the late types We thus conclude that the B- and Rc-
selected samples do give LF evolution results that are generally in good agreement with the sole
exception of the P value for the early types
5 Comparisons with Previous Surveys
In this section we compare our LF evolution results with those obtained from three previous
intermediate-z redshift surveys We rst briey compare against the eld galaxy sample from the
CNOC1 Cluster Redshift Survey the immediate predecessor of CNOC2 We then continue with the
two next largest intermediate-z redshift survey samples specically the Canada-France Redshift
Survey and the composite Autob Redshift Survey
51 CNOC1 Cluster Redshift Survey  Field Sample
The CNOC1 Cluster Redshift Survey Carlberg et al 1996 Yee et al 1996 included obser-
vations of both cluster and eld galaxies in the elds of 16 high X-ray luminosity clusters The
observational techniques used in the CNOC1 survey are very similar to those used in CNOC2 but
CNOC1 galaxies only have Gunn r and g photometry available Lin et al 1997 examine the LF
for a sample of 389 CNOC1 eld galaxies with redshifts 02  z  06 and apparent magnitudes
18  r  22 Non-evolving luminosity functions in BAB and Gunn r are computed for the whole
CNOC1 eld sample as well as for blue and red subsets divided by the observed g  r color of a
CWW Sbc galaxy Consistent with the CNOC2 results the CNOC1 LFs show the same trend of
a steeper faint-end slope for blue galaxies relative to red ones The CNOC1 sample is too small
for the LF evolution analysis of the present paper but Lin et al 1997 have computed luminosity
densities and have shown that the CNOC1 blue galaxy Lz increases strongly with redshift while
 25 
the CNOC1 red galaxy Lz is essentially constant with z These results are consistent with those
found for the CNOC2 sample
We have also computed non-evolving BAB and r LFs for CNOC2 galaxies using basically the
same CWW Sbc cut applied to CNOC1 For each of the all blue and red samples and for both rest-
frame bandpasses we conrm that the CNOC1 and CNOC2 results are indeed in good quantitative
agreement in M   and normalization The errors of the CNOC1 LFs are fairly large however
primarily because of its much smaller sample size so that unfortunately little improvement in the
LF constraints is gained by adding the CNOC1 eld data into the CNOC2 sample The present
CNOC2 LF results essentially supercede those obtained earlier from CNOC1
52 Canada-France Redshift Survey CFRS
The Canada-France Redshift Survey CFRS Lilly et al 1995a consists of 591 galaxy redshifts
up to z  1 The sample is selected in the I-band with 175  IAB  225 and is distributed
over ve widely separated elds totaling 125 arcmin2 on the sky Lilly et al 1995b examine the
evolution of the CFRS LF for 0  z  1 They divide their sample by observed V  IAB color
also using CWW SEDs and nd rapid evolution in the LF of galaxies bluer than a CWW Sbc
galaxy contrasted with little change in the LF of redder-than-Sbc galaxies
Lilly et al 1995b also split their sample into several redshift bins including 208 galaxies in a
02  z  05 bin which overlaps most with the CNOC2 redshift limits In Figure 19 we compare
the CFRS BAB LF results the best estimates of Lilly et al 1995b against those for a nearly ten
times larger sample of 1842 CNOC2 galaxies with 02  z  05 We also use the CWW Sbc cut
to divide our sample into red and blue subsets we initially do not include evolution as the CFRS
results are t using non-evolving Schechter functions The bottom panels in the gure show that
the M - values for the two surveys are in good agreement the CFRS error contours have been
calculated by us using CFRS redshift catalog data kindly supplied by Simon Lilly This is also
demonstrated in the middle panels where we have renormalized the CNOC2 LFs to match the
normalizations of the CFRS LFs using an equation analogous to equation 20 in order to focus
on comparing the LF shapes The renormalizations aect the red-galaxy LFs very little as the
CNOC2 and CFRS results agree well in the rst place However as shown in the top panels there
is a noticeable dierence in the blue-galaxy LFs where CNOC2 shows a higher number density
than CFRS
We next add evolution into our CNOC2 LF ts using our usual 5-parameter method in
order to extrapolate our luminosity density results into the 05  z  1 redshift range probed by
CFRS as shown in Figure 20 We have extended the upper redshift limit to z  065 for the
CNOC2 blue sample in order have an additional data point to show Notice from Figure 3 that
there does not appear to be any obvious incompleteness for bluer-than-Sbc CNOC2 galaxies for
055  z  065 as there is for redder-than-Sbc galaxies and also note that there is no obvious
 26 
dip due to incompleteness in the last CNOC2 blue-galaxy L point at z  06 in Figure 20 The
CFRS L results are taken from Lilly et al 1996 their LF-estimated 4400A values and the
two surveys do appear consistent within the errors The CNOC2 blue Lz and extrapolation
more or less parallel the CFRS results but are about 50 higher overall The CNOC2 red Lz
and extrapolation agree well with CFRS at z  07 but appears to overshoot CFRS in the highest
redshift bin z  09
We note that the dierence in the CNOC2 and CFRS blue-galaxy luminosity densities may be
consistent with the galaxy density uctuations expected for these two surveys We estimate using
the procedure described at the end of  32 that the density uctuations  are approximately
12 and 13 for the 02  z  05 volumes in CNOC2 and CFRS respectively The ratio of
roughly 15 in the blue-galaxy L for the two surveys would then have a 1 uncertainty assuming
Gaussian galaxy density uctuations of about 027 so the luminosity densities dier at the  2
level and even less so if we include the remaining sampling and LF-t contributions to the total
error on L On the other hand it is unclear why we do not see any dierences in the respective red
galaxy populations which should show stronger density uctuations than the blue galaxies eg
Figure 6 Thus the blue-galaxy dierences may be caused instead by some systematic dierences
in eg galaxy classication andor photometry for blue galaxies in the two surveys although one
might then have expected to see a more signicant dierence in the shapes of the CNOC2 and
CFRS luminosity functions
Recently galaxy evolution results have also been reported for a sample of 341 galaxies drawn
from the CFRS and the AutobLow Dispersion Survey Spectrograph LDSS data sets which
have morphologies classied from Hubble Space Telescope images Brinchmann et al 1998 Lilly et
al 1998 Though there is clearly correlation between the early intermediate and late SEDcolor
classications adopted in this paper and the elliptical spiral and peculiar morphological
categories respectively dened by Brinchmann et al 1998 the correlations are broad enough to
preclude a detailed quantitative comparison We will defer this for a future paper on morpholog-
ical classications of CNOC2 galaxies Here we will simply mention two LF-related results from
Brinchmann et al 1998 which are qualitatively consistent with our results 1 the LF of the
spiral CFRSLDSS sample indicates about 1 magnitude of luminosity evolution in BAB by z  1
similar to the Q  09 value we nd for the CNOC2 intermediate-type galaxies which should be
dominated by spirals and 2 the peculiarirregular CFRSLDSS galaxies appear to be primarily
responsible for the rapid rise with redshift of the blue galaxy luminosity density a result consis-
tent with our observation that late-type CNOC2 galaxies cause the strong observed increase in the
overall L with redshift
53 Autob Redshift Survey
The Autob Redshift Survey is a composite of various galaxy survey samples Ellis et al 1996
and references therein and contains over 1700 redshifts with 0  z  075 The survey is selected in
 27 
the blue with apparent magnitudes in the range 115  bJ  240 Ellis et al 1996 nd an overall
steepening of the LF at higher redshifts and similar to CNOC2 and CFRS the LF evolution is
dominated by late-type galaxies which also show increased OII 3727 emission and thus stronger
star formation at higher redshifts
Ellis et al 1996 give overall bJ LFs in several redshift intervals including 015  z  035
and 035  z  075 bins which overlap with CNOC2 In Figure 21 we make the same redshift cuts
but with a z  055 upper limit and compute non-evolving LFs for comparison We show results
both for the standard CNOC2 17  Rc  215 sample N  2076 lled triangles and for a blue-
selected 18  B  23 CNOC2 sample N  1830 lled squares There is a signicant systematic
dierence between the two CNOC2 samples where the B-selected sample shows a steeper  and
brighter M  because of the increased contribution due to k-correction eects of bluer late-type
galaxies in the B-selected sample However this systematic oset between the Rc- and B-selected
samples is an artifact of trying to force t a single LF to the full galaxy population and does not
occur if we subdivide into three populations as we did before  45 Using a B-selected CNOC2
sample signicantly improves the agreement with the 015  z  035 Autob results although
the 2 M - error contours still do not quite overlap as Autob shows a steeper  and a brighter
M  Note that although the CNOC2 and Autob samples here are similar in size the Autob
error contours are smaller because of Autobs much wider apparent magnitude limits compared to
CNOC2 Nonetheless a visual comparison of the two lower-z LFs top left panel of Figure 21
does show reasonable agreement However in the higher-z bin there is a noticeable mismatch in
M  andor normalization between the CNOC2 and Autob results
The causes of these discrepancies are not known but can include sampling uctuations as well
as unaccounted systematic dierences in sample selection galaxy classications and k-corrections
photometry and the like see Lin et al 1997 for additional discussion Note that sample size
may be an important consideration for the comparison in the higher-redshift bin Though the
overall Autob sample contains some 1700 redshifts the relevant sample sizes here are smaller
Ellis 1997 Figure 6b N  665 for 015  z  035 and only N  152 for 035  z  075 The
corresponding CNOC2 B-selected sample sizes are N  940 and N  890 so that the high-z
CNOC2 sample is nearly 6 times larger than the corresponding Autob data set Also large-scale
galaxy density uctuations may play a role The values of  are estimated to be 16 and 13
for the low- and high-z CNOC2 volumes respectively and are presumably somewhat larger for the
corresponding Autob volumes although we have not done the exact calculations as we lack certain
needed Autob sample details As we saw earlier in our CFRS comparison such values of 
do not preclude a factor of 15 in the relative LF normalizations which would signicantly reduce
the discrepancy in the high-z bin We have also checked whether random k-correction errors and
photometric errors in the Autob sample might be responsible for the M  and  dierences The
Autob k-corrections are assigned primarily on the basis of galaxy spectral classications rather
than more directly via multicolor photometry as we do Ellis et al 1996 estimate that their k-
correction errors due to spectral misclassications have a redshift dependence B  05z mag our
 28 
interpretation of their Figure 6 Also the Autob photometry is based mainly on photographic
plate data with errors typically 01-02 mag in contrast to CNOC2 CCD photometry with errors
 01 mag Both these eects will tend to bias the Autob results to brighter M  and steeper  see
 442 so we have checked the eect of adding such k-correction errors and photometric errors 02
mag Gaussian to our B magnitudes In agreement with Ellis et al 1996 and Heyl et al 1997
we nd that the dierences are small with M   02 and   01 not enough to signicantly
improve the agreement of the M - contours in the low-z bin and of the wrong sign for the high-z
bin We have also tried computing bJ absolute magnitudes and LFs for CNOC2 galaxies using
the bJ response function instead of our usual Johnson B but it makes negligible dierence to our
results Additional exploration of Autob vs CNOC2 photometry systematics likely requires us to
apply our photometry codes to the original Autob data Such a detailed comparison may not be
warranted given that the main CNOC2Autob dierences lie in the high-z bin where the main
culprits may very well be galaxy density uctuations and the small Autob sample size there
Heyl et al 1997 have classied Autob galaxies into six types based on cross-correlation
against local galaxy spectral templates and examined the evolution of the LF divided by galaxy
spectral type Note that in discussing LF evolution Heyl et al typically use the three broader cat-
egories early-type ES0 early-type spirals and late-type spirals each including two of their
original six types which have obvious but broad correlations relative to our early intermediate
and late types respectively Also their LF evolution model is similar but not identical to ours
and involves six parameters compared to our ve with the additional parameter characterizing
the rate of evolution of  which we have taken as xed with redshift
In addition unlike our
analysis Heyl et al do not plot error contours like our P -Q diagrams to show the correlations
among their LF evolution parameters Because both their classication and analysis methods are
dierent from ours and because we have already noted some discrepancies between the CNOC2
and Autob results above we will not attempt a detailed quantitative comparison here We will
note however that generally speaking the Heyl et al 1997 results are qualitatively consistent with
ours Specically they nd 1 no signicant evolution of the ES0 LF out to at least z  05
2 modest evolution in the LF of early-type spirals characterized by steepening of  at higher
redshifts rather than by changes in M  or  and 3 strong evolution in the LF of late-type spirals
described by steepening  brightening M  and increasing  at higher z The main dierence
compared to CNOC2 lies in the steepening  observed in Autob contrasted with the good match
of our z  constant models to the CNOC2 data see Figure 8 in particular Also the Q  1
luminosity evolution we nd in our early- and intermediate-type LFs is somewhat dierent from
the trends seen in the Autob ES0 and early-spiral LFs It is not clear at present what is re-
sponsible for these detailed CNOC2Autob evolution dierences but we note in particular that
the dierent galaxy classication schemes involved may play an important role We will return to
this comparison again in a future paper on application of spectral classications to the full CNOC2
sample

6 Conclusions
In this paper we have examined the evolution of the luminosity function for a sample of
over 2000 eld galaxies with 012  z  055 and 170  Rc  215 drawn from two dierent sky
patches of the CNOC2 Field Galaxy Redshift Survey Although this sample comprises only half the
ultimate CNOC2 data set it is nonetheless the largest intermediate-redshift galaxy survey sample
at present The availability of UBVRcIc photometry for our sample allows galaxy classications
by SED type as well as computation of LFs in dierent rest-frame bandpasses In addition the
multicolor photometry permits us to examine sample selection eects in detail and allows us to
construct galaxy weights to account for our redshift success rates as functions of galaxy magnitude
and color
In particular we have calculated LF parameters in the BAB Rc and U bands for early-
intermediate- and late-type galaxies classied using UBVRcIc colors derived from the non-evolving
galaxy spectral energy distributions of Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 We present a description
of the LF evolution in terms of a ve-parameter model involving the usual three Schechter function
parameters plus two additional parameters P and Q describing number density and luminosity
evolution rates respectively eq 10 The best-t parameters of our LF evolution models are given
in Tables 1 and 2 We nd that the faint-end slope of the LF is steeper for later-type galaxies
relative to earlier-type objects consistent with previous LF studies at both intermediate and low
redshifts
The principal results of this paper are the quantitative separation of luminosity and density
evolution in the LFs of dierent galaxy populations and the nding that the character of the
LF evolution is strongly type dependent varying from primarily luminosity evolution for early-
type galaxies to predominantly density evolution for late-type objects We quantify the rates of
luminosity function evolution using our P and Q parameters Specically we see that for q0  05
1 the late-type galaxy LF is best t by strong positive density evolution P  31 with nearly no
luminosity evolution Q  02 2 the intermediate-type LF shows positive luminosity evolution
Q  09 plus weak positive density evolution P  07 resulting in mild positive evolution in
the luminosity density L and 3 the early-type LF shows positive luminosity evolution Q  16
which is nearly compensated by negative density evolution P  11 resulting in a very weak
positive evolution in L However we should note that the P and Q parameters are strongly
correlated for late-type galaxies and no-evolution for early- and intermediate-type objects is
ruled out at only about the 2 condence level Nonetheless it is a robust result that the LFs
of late and earlyintermediate galaxies are evolving dierently and occupy dierent regions of P -
Q parameter space Moreover there is a distinct contrast between the sharply rising luminosity
density of late-type galaxies and the relatively constant L of early- and intermediate-type objects
This is probably not too surprising given that one expects the rapidly evolving population to
consist of those galaxies actively forming stars in the past which are essentially the late types
These general conclusions are little changed by adopting a dierent value of q0  01
 30 
The rates of luminosity evolution Q  1 for our early and intermediate types are in the
range expected from models of galaxy evolution eg Bruzual  Charlot 1996 At face value the
strong density evolution observed for late types suggests that mergers play an important role in the
evolution of these galaxies However other processes particularly those aecting star formation
properties may mimic the eect of mergers and cause similar changes in number density eg
a starbursting sub-population among the late types at high-z may be responsible for the density
evolution In Paper II we will test various physical galaxy evolution models in detail including
the eects of dierent star formation histories ages stellar initial mass functions dust content and
the like Nonetheless whatever the responsible physical mechanisms are they will need to explain
the strong correlation between galaxy type and the character of the LF evolution in particular
the strong increase in the apparent density evolution as one proceeds to later galaxy types The
relevant underlying physical variables controlling the evolution should thus be closely correlated
with the galaxy SED type On the other hand within each of our galaxy categories those physical
variables are probably not strongly correlated with galaxy luminosity since the data are well-t
by our xed- evolution models so that the evolution does not vary much with luminosity within
each galaxy category It may be a challenge for physical models to explain this combination of
strong type-dependence in the LF evolution coupled with relatively little luminosity-dependence
of the evolution within each galaxy type
We also compute SED type distributions UBVRcIc galaxy number counts and various color
distributions for CNOC2 galaxies In particular we nd that extrapolations of our LF evolution
models to z  075 yield good matches to the observed number counts and color distributions thus
providing an additional check on the validity of our LF evolution results
In addition we have
veried that various systematic eects specically patch-to-patch variations photometric errors
surface brightness selection redshift incompleteness and apparent magnitude incompleteness do
not signicantly aect our results  1 dierence typically
Finally we note that our LF results are generally consistent with those found in previous
intermediate-z redshift surveys as veried in specic comparisons against results from the next two
largest samples CFRS and Autob However there are still some unresolved detailed discrepancies
particularly with respect to the B-selected Autob survey which may be due to dierences in galaxy
classication or sample selection methods
In this paper we have simply presented a description of the evolution of the LFs of dierent
intermediate-redshift galaxies without delving into the possible underlying physical processes As
mentioned earlier in our second LF paper we will actually confront the CNOC2 observations
against various galaxy evolution models in order to better understand and constrain those physical
mechanisms Subsequent papers on galaxy population evolution in CNOC2 will also make use of
the morphological and spectral information that will become available for CNOC2 galaxies once the
appropriate data are fully reduced Ultimately the doubled size of the full CNOC2 sample over the
present interim sample will signicantly improve upon the LF evolution constraints that we have
presented here We are also in the process of deriving properly calibrated photometric redshifts
 31 
which should provide another factor of two increase in useful sample size for Rc  215 galaxies
Future papers will re-examine the question of LF evolution using these even larger CNOC2 galaxy
data sets
