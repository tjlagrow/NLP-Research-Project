Abstract
Elliptical and S0 galaxies dominate the galaxy population in nearby
rich clusters such as Coma Studies of the evolution of the colors mass-
to-light ratios and line indices of early-type galaxies indicate that they
have been a highly homogeneous slowly evolving population over the last
 65  of the age of the Universe On the other hand recent evidence
suggests that many early-type galaxies in clusters have been transformed
from spiral galaxies since z  1 Arguably the most spectacular evidence
for such transformations is the incidence of red merger systems in several
high redshift clusters Due to this morphological evolution the sample
of early-type galaxies at high redshift is only a subsample of the sample
of early-type galaxies at low redshift This progenitor bias results in
an overestimate of the mean formation redshift if simple models with-
out morphological transformations are used Models which incorporate
morphological evolution explicitly can bring the homogeneity slow evo-
lution and morphological transformations into agreement The modeling
shows that the corrected mean formation redshift of the stars in early-
type galaxies may be as low as z  2 in a  dominated Universe
Introduction
The galaxy population in rich clusters is dominated by early-type galaxies S0
and elliptical galaxies The study of these objects gives insight in the formation
of the most massive disk- and spheroidal galaxies in the Universe and in the
processes governing star formation at early times Furthermore cluster galaxies
provide critical tests of the hierarchical paradigm for galaxy formation In cur-
rently popular semi-analytical galaxy formation models in a CDM Universe the
descendants of the Ly-break population are massive galaxies in groups and clus-
ters Baugh et al 1998 These models also predict that signicant dierences
should exist between early-type galaxies in clusters and those in the general eld
Kaumann 1996
It has been known for a long time that early-type galaxies in clusters form
a very homogeneous population at a given luminosity they show a very small
scatter in their colors ML ratios and line indices eg Bower et al 1992
The simplest interpretation of this high degree of homogeneity is a small spread
in age although it has been argued that a larger age spread could be masked

by correlated metallicity variations eg Trager et al 20001 Determining the
mean age of nearby early-type galaxies has proven to be a formidable challenge
The main reason is the well known age-metallicity degeneracy in tting early-
type galaxy spectra eg Worthey 1994 Furthermore the observed abundance
ratios of early-type galaxies cannot be reproduced with simple stellar population
synthesis models which makes absolute determinations of age and metallicity
even more uncertain It is therefore not surprising that most of our understand-
ing of the formation and evolution of cluster early-type galaxies has come from
studies of clusters at large lookback times
Since the seminal work by Butcher  Oemler 1978 on the colors of galaxies
in two distant clusters this eld has witnessed great progress measurements of
redshifts morphologies colors ML ratios and line indices of cluster galaxies
currently span  65  of the age of the Universe Examples of successful ongoing
programs are the MORPHS collaboration Smail et al 1997 who obtained deep
HST images of the cores of  10 clusters at 03  z  05 the CNOC group
Yee et al 1996 who obtained extensive wide eld spectroscopy and imaging
of X-ray selected clusters at 02  z  05 the work by Lubin Postman  Oke
on optically selected clusters at z  08 and our wide eld HST imaging and
extensive spectroscopy of X-ray clusters2
As in many other elds Hubble Space Telescope imaging and spectroscopy
with large ground-based telescopes have been instrumental in this advance An
additional factor has been the success of surveys of increasing sophistication to
nd ever more distant clusters The progress in this area that was demonstrated
at the meeting is encouraging and should lead to a better understanding of
the interplay between the selection of clusters and the derived evolution of the
galaxies within them see eg the review by Marc Postman
2 Evolution of early-type galaxies
Studies of the evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters are in remarkable agree-
ment Studies of their colors eg Ellis et al 1997 Stanford et al 1998 ML
ratios van Dokkum  Franx 1996 Bender et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 1998
Kelson et al 2000 and line indices Bender et al 1998 Kelson et al 2001 show
that they remain a very homogeneous population and evolve only slowly all the
way from z  0 to z  1
21 Evolution of the Fundamental Plane
The strongest constraints on the mean star formation epoch have come from
the evolution of the Fundamental Plane FP relation The Fundamental Plane
Djorgovski  Davis 1987 is a relation between the eective radius re eective
e  125
surface brightness e and central velocity dispersion  such that re08
in the B band The implication of the existence of the FP is that ML ratios of
e 04 
galaxies correlate strongly with their structural parameters ML  r02
1Note that this interpretation requires that we observe early-type galaxies at a special time
when age and metallicity variations exactly cancel

Figure 1
Evolution of the mean MLB ratio of early-type galaxies
as determined from the FP relation The observed evolution is slow
indicating an early formation of the stars
M 02 Faber et al 1987 The power of the FP lies in this relation to ML ratios
and its usefulness for galaxy evolution studies stems from its small scatter and
the fact that it applies to both elliptical and S0 galaxies
The ML ratios of galaxies are expected to evolve because the luminosity
of their stellar populations decreases as they age passive evolution The
rate of evolution depends on the time that has elapsed since the population was
formed the light of young stellar populations is dominated by massive stars
which have a short life time on the main sequence whereas the light of old
stellar populations is dominated by long lived low mass stars In the rest frame
B band the expected evolution is ML  t  tform091 for a Salpeter IMF the
coecient depends on the passband and the IMF but is only weakly dependent
on the metallicity As a result the rate of evolution of the intercept of the FP
gives a strong constraint on the mean stellar age of early-type galaxies
The measured evolution of MLB to z  083 is shown in Fig 1 from
van Dokkum et al 1998 The evolution is surprisingly low ln MLB  z
indicating stellar formation redshifts of z  28 for m  03   0 and a
Salpeter IMF Studies of the evolution of colors eg Stanford et al 1998 and
line indices Bender et al 1998 Kelson et al 2001 have yielded very similar
results In general color evolution eectively the dierence between the lumi-
nosity evolution in each of two passbands can not be measured to the same
precision as evolution in ML ratios
It is dicult but not impossible to extend the FP measurements to even
higher redshift The practical limit probably lies around z  13 125 hr Keck
spectra of Extremely Red Objects in the cluster RXJ 08484453 at z  127
are just sucient to measure velocity dispersions van Dokkum  Stanford in
22 Evolution of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation
The color-magnitude CM relation provides important additional constraints
on the star formation epoch of early-type galaxies Because spectroscopy is not
required it is relatively straightforward to obtain large samples enabling studies
of the evolution of the scatter and slope of the relation as well as its zeropoint
P G van Dokkum
Figure 2
Evolution of the scatter in the color-magnitude relation
with redshift from literature data see text The scatter shows little
evolution implying that the scatter in age is small at all times
The scatter is of particular interest because it measures the spread in stellar
age among early-type galaxies The rest frame U  V color evolution of a stellar
population can be described by LV LU  t  tformU V  with U  108 and
V  081 It can be shown that the scatter in the CM relation at any time t is
proportional to the scatter in luminosity weighted age divided by the mean age
eg van Dokkum et al 2000
The observed evolution of the scatter in the CM relation is shown in Fig 2
Ground based data are from Bower et al 1992 and Terlevich et al 2001 for
Coma and from Stanford et al 1998 for high redshift clusters HST measure-
ments have smaller errorbars and are from Ellis et al 1997 and van Dokkum
et al 1998 2000 2001 The scatter remains very small all the way from z  0
to z  13 This result is quite surprising because the mean age of galaxies
should be at least a factor 2 smaller at z  1 Therefore if the scatter in the
CM relation at z  0 is caused by age variations one might expect the scatter
to increase by at least a factor 2 from z  0 to z  1 Following a similar line of
reasoning it has been argued that the scatter in the CM relation of nearby clus-
ters is mainly due to metallicity variations and that the formation of early-type
galaxies is even more synchronized than implied by the tight scaling relations
observed at low redshift eg Stanford et al 1998 Indeed when taken at face
value the scatter observed at z  127 implies a spread in age of only  5  at
the present epoch
In summary studies of the observed evolution of early-type galaxies indicate
that they have been a highly homogeneous slowly evolving population over
at least the latter  65  of the age of the Universe To satisfy the tightest
observational constraints it appears that early-type galaxies would have to have
formed at very high redshift z  3 in a very short time  500 Myr

31 The Butcher-Oemler eect
It has been known for a long time that something must be amiss with the
simple picture of early formation presented above The earliest evidence for
signicant recent evolution in cluster environments was the discovery of the
Butcher-Oemler eect the increase with redshift of the fraction of blue galaxies
in clusters Butcher  Oemler 1978 1984 Figure 3 is a compilation showing the
evolution of the blue fraction with redshift with data from Butcher  Oemler
1984 Smail et al 1998 Fabricant et al 1991 van Dokkum et al 2000
and Ellingson et al 2001

has signicant scatter
Evolution of the blue galaxy fraction in clusters The trend
There is clearly a trend in Fig 3 albeit with a large scatter Much of the
work on cluster galaxies in subsequent decades  too much to do justice in this
short review  was aimed at understanding the nature of these blue galaxies It
has become clear that most of the blue galaxies are not early-type galaxies but
low mass spirals and irregulars eg Smail et al 1997 Some show ongoing star
formation others are currently not forming stars but have enhanced Balmer
absorption lines indicating a recent star burst eg Dressler  Gunn 1983
Among the more persistent ideas is that the Butcher-Oemler eect is driven by
infall of blue late-type galaxies from the eld which subsequently lose their fuel
for star formation in interactions with other galaxies andor the hot X-ray gas
eg Abraham et al 1996 Ellingson et al 2001 In this picture the redshift
dependence of the blue fraction may be the result of a decreasing infall rate with
time andor reect the well established overall decrease of the star formation
rate in the eld population eg Kaumann 1995
P G van Dokkum
It is usually assumed that a sizable fraction of the blue population are pro-
genitors of low mass red early-type galaxies in nearby clusters eg Kodama 
Bower 2001 in apparent conict with the early formation of early-type galaxies
inferred from studies of their color and luminosity evolution
32 Evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction
Dressler et al 1997 report a high fraction of spiral galaxies in clusters at
03  z  05 These galaxies are much rarer in nearby rich clusters and hence
must have transformed into early-type galaxies between z  05 and z  0
Other studies eg Couch et al 1998 van Dokkum et al 2001 have conrmed
this trend and extended it to z  13 The evolution of the early-type galaxy
fraction is shown in Fig 4 The early-type fraction decreases by a factor  2
from z  0 to z  1 although the trend has signicant scatter
Figure 4
various studies and taken from van Dokkum et al 2001
Evolution of the early-type galaxy fraction compiled from
Dressler et al found that the increased fraction of spiral galaxies at high
redshift is accompanied by a low fraction of S0 galaxies and concluded that
the z  04 spiral galaxies transform into S0 galaxies They postulate that the
formation of elliptical galaxies predated the virialization of the clusters in which
they now live However there is some controversy over the relative numbers
of elliptical and S0 galaxies in distant clusters3 Dressler et al claim that S0
galaxies are virtually absent at z  04 suggesting a factor  4 evolution over
3Importantly there is no such controversy over the combined number of Es and S0s ie the
early-type galaxy fraction
Evolution of Cluster Galaxies
the past  4 Gyr Others have debated this and nd a much milder evolution
in the ES0 ratio eg Andreon et al 1997
One of the problems is the diculty in distinguishing elliptical and S0 galax-
ies at high redshift see Fabricant et al 2000 and references therein Spatially
resolved kinematics may oer an elegant solution An example is shown in Fig
5 From the HST image alone it is dicult to determine whether this z  083
galaxy is an elliptical or an S0 The kinematics reveal a rapidly rotating cold
disk in addition to a hot bulge and show that this object is a massive S0

Based on the HST image shown at left it is dicult

33 Mergers in z  1 clusters
The discovery of a large number of red merger systems in the cluster MS 105403
at z  083 is arguably the most spectacular evidence for recent formation of
massive early-type galaxies van Dokkum et al 1999 We obtained deep multi-
color images of this cluster at 6 pointings with WFPC2 on HST Redshifts of
galaxies in this eld were obtained with the Keck Telescope 89 of those are
cluster members The survey is described in van Dokkum et al 2000
We found that 17  of the galaxies in MS 105403 are merger systems Most
of the mergers are very luminous MB  22 in the rest frame or  2L at
z  083 and a striking way to display our result is to show a panel with the 16
brightest conrmed cluster members Fig 6 Five were classied as mergers
The mergers are generally red with a few exceptions Similarly the spectra
of most of the mergers do not show strong emission lines These results suggest
that the bulk of the stars was formed well before the merger Hence the stel-
lar age of the merged galaxies will be signicantly dierent from the assembly

age The physical reason for the low star formation is unknown
it is possi-
ble that the massive precursor galaxies had already lost their cold gas due to
internal processes such as super winds or winds driven by nuclear activity
Alternatively the cold gas may have been stripped by the cluster X-ray gas or
exhausted in an earlier phase of merging in dense infalling groups
It is not yet known whether the galaxy population of MS 105403 is typical
for its redshift One possibility is that such a phase of enhanced merging occurs
at dierent redshifts for dierent clusters In MS 105403 the mergers probably
occur in infalling subclumps and its high merger fraction could be related to its
overall unvirialized state van Dokkum et al 1999
We recently completed a morphological study of an even higher redshift
cluster RXJ 08484453 at z  127 van Dokkum et al 2001 The Brightest
Cluster Galaxy has an asymmetric outer envelope demonstrating that it recently
experienced a merger or strong tidal interaction The second brightest galaxy is
yet another red merger system in this case between three galaxies of comparable
brightness This remarkable system shows that red mergers are not unique to
MS 105403 and may even be common at z  1 Studies of more clusters are

required to better quantify the role of these red mergers in the formation of
massive galaxies
4 Eects of morphological evolution the progenitor bias
The existence of the Butcher-Oemler eect the evolution of the early-type
galaxy fraction and the presence of mergers in distant clusters imply that simple
models for the evolution of early-type galaxies in clusters are insucient There-
fore we need to consider more complex models that incorporate morphological
transformations The problem was rst addressed in Franx  van Dokkum
1996 and worked out in van Dokkum  Franx 2001
41 Complex models
We assume that early-type galaxies have two phases in their history rst a
relatively long phase in which they were forming stars at a rate which can
be constant or variable with time Second they are transformed into galaxies
without star formation through a merger gas-stripping or other mechanism
During a period of  1 Gyr they are classied as post-starburst galaxy merger
galaxy or other special type After that they are classied as normal early-
type galaxies As a result the set of early-type galaxies evolves and the set of
galaxies classied as early-types at z  0 is not the same as the set of galaxies
classied as early-types at high redshift
The evolution of the ML ratio of individual galaxies is shown in Fig 7c
The evolution of the ML ratio of each galaxy is indicated with a dotted line
when it is not yet classied as early-type and with a continuous curve when it
is classied as early-type galaxy As is obvious from the plot the continuous
addition of young early-type galaxies to the sample has a signicant eect on
the evolution of the mean ML ratio the newly added galaxies pull the mean
ML ratio to lower values As a result the evolution of the mean ML ratio of
the full sample is very slow  much slower than the evolution of the ML ratio
of typical individual galaxies This eect is called progenitor bias as we
compare the ML ratios of early-type galaxies at dierent redshifts we compare
between dierent sets of galaxies and the evolution of their properties can be
misinterpreted when morphological evolution is ignored
The evolution of the mean ML ratio of the early-types is shown in Fig 7d
As can be seen the mean evolution is slow The slope of the ML  z relation is
comparable to the slope for a single galaxy which formed at very high redshift
even though the mean formation redshift of all early-type galaxies at z  0 is
low at zform  2 The long dashed curve in the gure indicates the evolution
of the mean ML ratio of all galaxies classied as early-types at z  0 The
evolution is much faster as expected The dierence between these two curves
is caused by the progenitor bias and it can be quite substantial
The scatter for the early-types at any redshift is indicated by the shaded
region in Fig 7d Because the youngest galaxies drop out of the sample at
higher redshift the scatter remains constant or even decreases slightly at higher
redshift The same holds for the scatter in the CM relation This counter-
intuitive result can be explained by the fact that the models are approximately
P G van Dokkum

simple models ab and complex models with morphological transfor-
mations cd See text and van Dokkum  Franx 2001
scale free in time and the relative age dierences between the early-type galaxies
are similar at all times
42 Application to data
Figure 8 shows two models which t the evolution of the ML ratio measured
from the Fundamental Plane and the evolution of the scatter in the color-
magnitude relation The morphological transformations are described by a sim-
ple function which provides a good t panel a Two models are explored for
the star formation rate during the phase when the galaxies are spirals the solid
line indicates a model with constant star formation rate and the dotted line
shows a model with declining star formation rate They both t the evolution
of the ML ratio well panel b The model with the declining star formation
ratio underpredicts the scatter in the color magnitude relation and ML ratios
Hence for this model the scatter is not produced entirely by age dierences but
also by scatter in the metallicity-magnitude relation or other eects
The progenitor bias for the two models is dierent as might be expected
from the dierence in the predicted scatter due to age variations When the
evolution of the ML ratio is tted with a simple model without morphological
transformations we obtain a mean formation redshift zform  65 The complex

clude morphological transformations can t the evolution of the early-
type galaxy fraction a the mean ML ratio b and the scatter in

made when using simple models ie without morphological transfor-
mations is shown in e See van Dokkum  Franx 2001 for details
model with constant star formation produces an estimate of zform  3 The
model with a declining star formation rate produces zform  4 These values
apply for a cosmology with m  03 They change to 26 20 and 22 respec-
tively for a at universe with m  03 Hence the eects of the progenitor bias
are modest but should not be ignored
5 Conclusions
Models which include morphological transformations can reconcile two appar-
ently contradictory lines of evidence the low scatter in the color magnitude
relation and the slow evolution of the ML ratio on one hand and the morpho-
logical evolution observed in rich clusters on the other A basic framework for
galaxy evolution in clusters which includes infall and morphological transforma-
tions seems to be developing and future observations will be aimed at rening
and testing these ideas The available data at z  1 are still sparse and the
clusters that have been studied so far may not be typical progenitors of run of
the mill nearby clusters It is expected that ACS on HST will make it much
easier to study clusters at this epoch the future of this eld can therefore be
considered bright
