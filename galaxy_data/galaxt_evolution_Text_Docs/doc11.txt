ABSTRACT
There has been plenty of observational evidence of cluster galaxy evolution such as the
Butcher-Oemler effect and the morphology-density relation However it has been difcult to
identify the origin of the cluster galaxy evolution It has been simply difcult to trace the com-
plicated process of galaxy evolution with several giga years of timescale using the observation
which only brings us with information of a single epoch Here we show that gravitational inter-
actionfriction between galaxies is the statistically dominant physical mechanism responsible
for the cluster galaxy evolution and that the well-favored ram-pressure stripping by the clus-
ter gas is not statistically driving the cluster galaxy evolution We have constructed the largest
composite cluster with 14548 member galaxies out of 335 clusters with   300 km s1
carefully selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey By measuring velocity dispersions of
various subsamples of galaxies in this composite cluster we found that bright cluster galaxies
M z  23 have signicantly smaller velocity dispersion than faint galaxies M z  23
with much greater precision than previous results eg Adami et al We interpret this as
direct evidence of the dynamical interactionfriction between cluster galaxies where massive
galaxies lose their velocity through the energy equipartition during the dynamical interac-
tionfriction with less massive galaxies We also found that star-forming late-type galaxies
have a larger velocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies This is inconsistent with the
ram-pressure stripping model since the ram-pressure is proportional to v2 ie stronger for
galaxies with high velocity the ram-pressure stripping cannot explain the observed trends of
passive evolved galaxies having low velocity rather than high velocity On the other hand the
result is again consistent with the dynamical galaxy-galaxy interactionfriction where more
evolved passive galaxies lose their velocity through dynamical interactionfriction

1 INTRODUCTION
It has been well-known that cluster galaxies evolve with redshift
Butcher  Oemler 19781984 found that fractions of blue galax-
ies in clusters increase with increasing redshift see also Rakos
Schombert 1995 Couch et al 19941998 Margoniner de Carvalho
2000 Margoniner et al 2001 Ellingson et al 2001 Kodama 
Bower 2001 Goto et al 2003a2004a but also see Andreon et al
19992004 In a modern version high redshift clusters are known
to have larger fractions of star-forming galaxies than local clusters
Postman Lubin  Oke 19982001 Finn Zaritsky  McCarthy
It is also known that cluster galaxies show the morphological
evolution as well ie fractions of S0 galaxies are found to be lower

et al 2000 Goto et al 2003b also see Andreon et al 1998 Goto
et al 2003a2004a used 516 clusters found in the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Goto et al 2002ab to verify this effect with greater
statistical signicance
These numerous observational evidences suggest that a certain
physical mechanisms is changing the morphology and star forma-
tion rate SFR of cluster galaxies as a function of redshift How-
ever to date it has been difcult to specify what physical mecha-
nisms determine morphology and SFR of galaxies in clusters Since
observations only provide us with a snapshot of the cosmic history
it has been difcult to trace the complicated process of galaxy evo-
lution using traditional observational information on photometry
and spectral energy distribution It is also worth noting that EA
ka or post-starburst galaxies which often thought to be cluster-
T Goto
related are found to have their origin in mergerinteraction with ac-
companying galaxies Goto et al 2003de2004bc and thus EA
galaxies are not likely to be a product of the morphological transi-
tion in cluster regions
Various physical mechanisms have been proposed to explain
the cluster galaxy evolution One of the most popular candidates is
the ram-pressure stripping of cold gas by the intra-cluster medium
Gunn  Gott 1972 Farouki  Shapiro 1980 Kent 1981 Fujita 
Nagashima 1999 Abadi Moore  Bower 1999 Quilis Moore 
Bower 2000 Fujita 2004 Fujita  Goto 2004 In this ram-pressure
stripping model a galaxy infalling from outside of a cluster suffers
from the ram-pressure by the intra-cluster medium ICM and then
the cold gas in the disk of the galaxy becomes stripped away Once
the cold gas is stripped the star formation especially that in the
disk where most of the cold gas exists rapidly ceases in the time
scale of  50Myr Quilis et al 2000 As a result the galaxy colour
becomes red and its morphology becomes similar to a S0 galaxy
eg Fujita  Nagashima 1999
A similarly favored model is the hot halo gas stripping stran-
gulation suffocation or starvation In this model hot gas resides in
a halo of a galaxy supplying the cold gas to the disk of the galaxy
The hot gas can be quickly stripped by the ram-pressure from the
ICM even with the smaller pressure that cannot remove the more
strongly-bound cold gas in the disk This is because the hot gas
resides in the outer regions halo of the galaxy and the gas den-
sity is much smaller Once the hot gas is stripped the supply to the
cold disk gas stops As a result the cold disk gas is gradually con-
sumed by the star formation Since the cold gas is the ingredient
of stars the star formation activity of the galaxy also gradually de-
clines Therefore the timescale of the decline of the star formation
is longer than that of the cold gas stripping Larson et al 1980
This hot gas stripping model has been favored over the cold gas
stripping model since recently red cluster galaxies have been found
beyond the virial radius of the clusters where the ICM density is
too low for the cold gas stripping to happen Kodama et al 2001b
Goto et al 2003c Treu et al 2003 Tanaka et al 2004 Goto et al
2004d
Galaxy velocity dispersion in clusters can bring a new obser-
vational constraint on the subject since it can directly probe the
kinematic state of cluster galaxies Previously Zabludoff  Franx
1993 reported the velocity distribution of spiral galaxies is dif-
ferent from those of other morphological populations in 36 clus-
ters they observed It is later reported that spiral galaxies have a
greater velocity dispersion than ellipticals in nearby clusters So-
dre et al 1989 Stein 1997 Adami et al 19982000 In addition
Adami et al 1998 reported that galaxies of different types have
different velocity dispersion proles being steeper for late type
galaxies Carlberg et al 1997 reported that red galaxies have a
smaller rms velocity dispersion by a factor of 131013 Biviano
et al 1997 found that velocity dispersion of emission line galax-
ies is on average 20 larger than that of other galaxies see also
Biviano et al 2002 Lares et al 2004 However in order to in-
vestigate subtle difference in kinematics of different subsamples
of cluster galaxies in greater accuracy large number of spectra are
required especially when measuring a velocity dispersion of rare
population of galaxies eg red late-types in Goto et al 2003c
Yamauchi  Goto 2004 In the literature there exists a handful
of clusters with 100 of spectroscopic members eg Czoske et
al 2002 Gal  Lubin 2004 however even with these extreme
cases there were not enough number of galaxies to measure veloc-
ity dispersion of subsamples of cluster galaxies precisely In order
to overcome this problem we have created a catalog of 335 galaxy
clusters with   300 km s1 using the 250000 spectra of Sloan
Digital Sky Survey SDSS Data Release 2 Abazajian et al 2004
Due to the large area coverage of the SDSS a composite cluster
created with this cluster catalog has an extremely large number of
14548 member galaxies And thus it is an ideal sample to mea-
sure velocity dispersion of different subsamples of galaxies The
statistics based on this sample is unparalleled to any of the previ-
ous work In addition to high precision measurements of previously
suggested subsamples such as separated by morphology emission
lines or magnitude we measure velocity dispersion of subsamples
separated by both morphology and emission lines which will bring
new insights as described later Before the SDSS it has been sim-
ply impossible to measure velocity dispersion of subsamples using
only dozens of galaxy clusters
This paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we de-
scribe the SDSS data and construct a catalog of 335 galaxy clus-
ters In Section 3 we measure the velocity dispersion of various
sub-samples of cluster members to investigate mass dependence
Section 31 morphology dependence Section 32 colour de-
pendence Section 33 the dependence on both morphology and
colour Section 34 and SFR dependence Section 35 We nd
evidence that massive galaxies have smaller velocity dispersion
than less massive galaxies and that passive late-type galaxies have
smaller velocity dispersion than star-forming late-type galaxies
In Section 41 we discuss possible systematics effects In Sec-
tion 42 we discuss the physical implications of our results on
the physical mechanisms that govern cluster galaxy evolution In
Section 5 we summarize our work and ndings Unless otherwise
stated we adopt the best-t WMAP cosmology h m L

21 The SDSS DR2 Data
We have downloaded the SDSS DR2 galaxy catalog using the
SDSS SQL tool Abazajian et al 2004 We only use those objects
classied as galaxies type3 ie extended with spectroscopi-
cally measured redshift of z  003 These two criteria can almost
entirely eliminate contamination from mis-classied stars and HII
regions in nearby galaxies The resulting number of galaxies used
is 253497
22 Constructing a Cluster Catalog
For each galaxy in this sample we measure the number of neighbor
galaxies within 15 Mpc in angular direction and 1000 km s1
in the line-of-sight direction If a galaxy has a neighbor neighbors
of the neighbor are searched using the same linking length of 15
Mpc and 1000 km s1 until no further neighbors are found It
is estimated that we require at least 20 galaxies to securely mea-
sure velocity dispersion of an individual cluster eg Biviano et
al 1997 Therefore only when the group has more than 20 linked
neighbors we regard it as a cluster
Once a cluster is found we measure the redshift and velocity
dispersion of the cluster using the biweight estimator with 3  clip-
ping since it is statistically more robust and efcient than the stan-
dard mean in computing the central location of a data-set Beers et
al 1990 If the cluster has a velocity dispersion greater than 300
km s1  we include 3  clipped members into a composite clus-
ter The relative velocity of each member galaxy to the cluster red-
shift is normalized by the velocity dispersion of the cluster to be in-
cluded into the composite cluster In this process we have removed
galaxies with a clustocentric radius of more than 2 virial radius in
angular direction using virial radii computed in Goto 2005b This
process nicely limits analysis to the regions with similar gas den-
sity when measuring velocity dispersion of various subsamples of
galaxies in the composite cluster
Among the SDSS DR2 sample we have found 335 clusters
with  20 members and   300 km s1  This cluster cata-
log contains one of the largest number of clusters with measured
velocity dispersion Among the member galaxies we adopted the
position of the brightest in z-band cluster galaxy as an angu-
lar position of the cluster This cluster catalog contains positions
RADECJ2000 redshift number of member galaxies and mea-
sured velocity dispersion of the clusters and is presented electroni-
cally 1 The created composite cluster has 14548 member galax-
ies which is by two orders of magnitude larger than a typical
number of member galaxies available in the literature Hereby we
have obtained the rst opportunity to investigate velocity dispersion
of various subsample of cluster galaxies with unprecedented high
precision We have re-measured velocity dispersion of this cluster
obtaining normalized  0993700058
00057 We take a conservative
approach in computing errors using Danese de Zotti  di Tul-
lio1980 which usually returns larger values than a jack knife es-
timator Nonetheless the errors are extremely small due to the large
number of member galaxies making the composite cluster an ideal
sample to investigate velocity dispersion of different subsamples of
galaxies
3 ANALYSIS  RESULTS
In the following subsections we measure velocity dispersion of dif-
ferent sub-samples of cluster galaxies using the biweight estimator
and the errors of Danese et al 1980 In subsection 31 we in-
vestigate velocity dispersion as a function of absolute magnitude
In subsections 32-35 we separate subsamples using morphology
colour and SFR
31 Velocity Dispersion as a Function of Absolute Magnitude
In this subsection we investigate velocity dispersion as a func-
tion of z-band absolute magnitude Mz We use the z-band ab-
solute magnitude as the closest approximation to the galaxy mass
among the 5 SDSS colour bands It is estimated the variation in
the mass-to-light ratio is only a factor of  3 in z-band Kauff-
mann et al 2003 In the following we use absolute magnitude
in z-band as a galaxy mass estimator We use Petrosian magnitude
corrected for galactic extinction using a reddening map of Schlegel
Finkbeiner  Davis 1998 We use k-correction given in Blanton
et al 2003v3 2 to calculate absolute magnitudes Fig 1 shows
the measured velocity dispersion as a function of Mz An immedi-
ately notable feature is that at Mz  230 the velocity disper-
sion decrease toward brighter absolute magnitude Also it is seen
that between Mz  200 and 230 the velocity dispersion are
consistent with a constant When we divide the sample using mor-
phology and colour in the following sections we limit galaxies to
225 6 Mz 6 205 in order to minimize the mass or Mz
dependent bias

Figure 1 Velocity dispersion of the composite cluster as a function of abso-
lute magnitude in z-band Dispersions are computed using galaxies in 05
mag bins The result is consistent with Adami et al 1998 but presented
with much greater precision
32 Velocity Dispersion as a Function of Galaxy Morphology
Next we investigate velocity dispersion for different morpholog-
ical types of galaxies We use the ratio of Petrosian 50 light
radius to Petrosian 90 light radius Cin measured in r-band
image to quantify galaxy morphology The analysis will reveal if
kinematic structures of galaxies depend on morphological galaxy
types To avoid magnitude dependent bias we only use galaxies
with 225 6 Mz 6 205 where velocity dispersion is constant
as a function of Mz Fig 1 We regard galaxies with Cin  04
as late-type galaxies and Cin 6 04 as early-type galaxies This
parameter Cin is known to be well correlated with eye-classied
morphology Shimasaku et al 2001 Strateva et al 2001 and thus
has been used in many previous studies eg Gomez et al 2003
Kauffmann et al 2004
We show the results in Table 1 where the late-type galax-
ies Cin  04 has  10400012
0012 and the early-type galax-
0007 Since both samples have
ies Cin 6 04 has  09630007
more than 3000 galaxies the difference is quite signicant  4
signicance level The difference is larger than the magnitude de-
pendence we saw in the 225 6 Mz 6 205 mag range in Fig
1 Therefore the results indicate that late-type galaxies have larger
velocity dispersion than early-type galaxies We discuss physical
implications of the result in Section 4
33 Velocity Dispersion as a Function of Galaxy Colour
Next we investigate velocity dispersion for populations of galaxies
with different colour The rest-frame colour of galaxies generally
correlates well with the star formation activity of galaxies eg
Kennicutt 1992 Therefore by investigating velocity dispersion as
a function of galaxy colour we can test if the dynamical state of
each cluster galaxy affects the star-formation activity of individual
galaxies We intend to separate blue and red galaxies using the rest-
frame u  r  222 Strateva et al 2001 showed that this colour

separates early- and late-type galaxies well at z  04 We use the
same magnitude range of 225 6 Mz 6 205 to minimize the
mass or Mz dependent bias
The resulting velocity dispersion of bluered galaxies in the
composite cluster are presented in Table 1 The blue galaxies in
the composite cluster has a velocity dispersion of  10850016
0015
whereas the red galaxies has  09610007
0007 Therefore the ve-
locity dispersion is larger for the blue galaxies with greater than 5
 signicance
However since galaxy morphology and galaxy colour is well
correlated in a sense that earlier type galaxies have redder colour
it is difcult to determine whether the velocity dispersion is more
sensitive to galaxy colour or morphology It is essential to use mor-
phology and colour at the same time to answer the question
ies have larger velocity dispersion at a 2  signicance level A
Kolomogorov-Smirnov test also shows that these two distributions
are different with greater than 96 signicance level
Next we examine the difference in velocity dispersion be-
tween red early-type galaxies u  r  222  Cin 6 04
and blue early-type galaxies u  r  222  Cin 6 04 As
is shown in Table 1 we found that red early-type galaxies have
larger velocity dispersion   09560007
0007 than blue ellipticals
  10920035
0032 at a 3 signicance level
Since the same morphological type of galaxies with different
colours have different velocity dispersion it is suggested that ve-
locity dispersion may be better correlated with galaxy colour than
galaxy morphology
34 Velocity Dispersion as a Function of Galaxy Colour and
Morphology
35 Velocity Dispersion as a Function of Galaxy SFR and
Morphology
In this section we use colour and morphology at the same time
in order to distinguish which one of the two is better correlated
with the velocity dispersion Since it has been suggested that the
timescale of the morphological evolution and spectral colour evo-
lution is considerably different in galaxy evolution Poggianti et al
1999 Goto et al 2003c 2004a McIntosh Rix  Caldwell 2004
this investigation may be able to bring insight on the origin of the
cluster galaxy evolution
In Table 1 we show velocity dispersion of red late-type galax-
ies and blue late-type galaxies in the composite cluster In the same
absolute magnitude range we select red late-type as galaxies with
u  r  222 and Cin  04 and blue late-type as galaxies with
u  r 6 222 and Cin  04 In Table 1 the red late-type galax-
ies u  r  222  Cin  04 have   09830018

and the blue late-type galaxies u  r  222  Cin  04

In this subsection we repeat analyses in Sections 33 and 34 using
galaxy SFR instead of colour This analysis brings important im-
plication on the ram-pressure stripping model since the time scale
in which H line disappear 50 Myr after the end of the star-
formation is much shorter than that of colour change 1 Gyr
The SFR is measured from the H emission lines corrected for dust
extinction stellar absorption and the aperture size AGNs are re-
moved from this analysis using Fig1 of Goto 2005b The detailed
description in measuring SFR is presented in Goto 2005b We
separate star-forming and passive galaxies at SFR of 2 Myr1
We have checked that a slight change in this criterion does not
change the results As is shown in Table 1 star-forming galaxies
have larger velocity dispersion   11280054
0047 than passive
galaxies   009600007
0007 This result is consistent with that
in Section 33 where the velocity dispersion was larger for blue
galaxies than red galaxies Next we measure velocity dispersion of
star-forming late-type galaxies SF R  2Myr1  Cin  04
and passive late-type galaxiesSF R  2Myr1  Cin  04
Being consistent with the result in Section 34 star-forming late-
type galaxies have larger velocity dispersion   12480092

than passive late-type galaxies   10100020
0019 Similarly star-
forming early-type galaxies have larger velocity dispersion  
10090068

0057 than passive early-type galaxies   09500008
4 DISCUSSION
41 Possible Systematic Effects
In Section 3 we found that massive galaxies have smaller velocity
dispersion than less massive galaxies and that blue late-type galax-
ies have larger velocity dispersion than the red late-type galaxies in
the composite cluster We rst consider possible systematic effects
that might mimic the observed results
In the cluster regions it is well-known that redelliptical galax-
ies are dominant in the cluster cores and the bluespiral galaxies are
more numerous in the outskirts the morphology-density relation
Postman et al 1984 Goto et al 2003b Therefore it is a concern
that the difference in the spatial distributions between our samples
might cause the observed trend in the velocity dispersion How-
ever in the cluster outskirts due to the increase in the distance in
the angular direction from the core galaxies lose the velocity in
the line-of-sight direction reducing the observed velocity disper-
sion Therefore observing more blue galaxies in the outskirts only
weakens the observed trend of blue galaxies having larger velocity
dispersion
Due to the physical size of the ber spectrograph of the SDSS
the adjacent bers cannot be closer than 55 arcsec on the sky Con-
sequently if there are more than one galaxy with r  1777 within
55 arcsec on the sky only one of them is spectroscopically observed
by the SDSS and the rest are missed from the sample Although the
SDSS tries to compensate for this ber collision problem in the
area where more than one spectroscopic plates are assigned un-
fortunately this effect is more severe in the dense regions such as
cluster cores However due to the uniform survey criteria of the
SDSS r  1777 the missing galaxies are randomly selected
and thus unbiased against colour or morphology Therefore the
ber collision problem only reduces the number of galaxies in each
subsample and does not alter the velocity dispersion
We used u  r  22 to separate blue and red galaxies in
Sections 33 and 34 Since post-starburst or EA galaxies have
u  r  22 Goto 2003e it is a concern that the post-starburst
galaxies might be classied as blue galaxies in spite of their lack of
on-going star formation activity However using a similar SDSS
data set we found that post-starburst galaxies are almost non-
existent in cluster regions in at least bright magnitude of low red-
shift clusters Goto 2003e2005a Even in the eld regions their
fractions are very small 01 of all galaxies In addition the
analysis obtained with the SFR of galaxies in Section 35 should be
unaffected by the post-starburst galaxies Therefore it is unlikely
that post-starburst galaxies affect the physical interpretation of our
results
42 Physical Implications
Considering that the above systematic effects are unlikely to be re-
sponsible for our results the observed result has signicant impli-
cation for the galaxy evolution models In Section 31 we found ev-
idence that massive galaxies have smaller velocity dispersion than
Velocity Dispersion of 335 Galaxy Clusters
less massive galaxies The only way for massive galaxies to reduce
velocity in a cluster is through the energy equipartion by dynam-
ical interactionfriction with less massive galaxies Since the ma-
jor merging of galaxies Mamon et al 1992 is not signicant in
a cluster with a large velocity dispersion this interaction may be
less vigorous high speed encounter galaxy harassment Moore et
al 19961998 In either case the observed decrease in velocity in-
dicates that massive galaxies lose their velocity due to the energy
equipartion through dynamical interactionfriction
Also the observed result has signicant implication for the
galaxy evolution models based on the pressure induced gas strip-
ping The ram-pressure by the cluster ICM is proportional to the
ICM density and square of the galaxy velocity  v2 Therefore
the ram-pressure should be stronger for galaxies with high veloc-
ity Naturally galaxies with higher velocity are expected to be more
stripped and evolved if the ram-pressure stripping or the hot gas
stripping is responsible for the cluster galaxy evolution However
the observed trend is opposite in our analysis star-forming late-
type galaxies show larger velocity dispersion than passive late-type
galaxies Thus the observed trend suggests that the ram-pressure
stripping is not likely to be a dominant physical process responsi-
ble for the colour evolution of the cluster galaxies
One might argue that the star-forming late-type galaxies may
be still in the process of accretion from the eld and thus they
might have the large velocity dispersion but have not yet felt the
ram-pressure To avoid the contamination from the still infalling
galaxies we have limited our analysis to those galaxies within 3
 of the velocity dispersion of the cluster they belong to In ad-
dition the timescale of the ram-pressure stripping is very short
50 Myr Quilis et al 2000 compared with that of galaxy in-
fall 1 Gyr Therefore the galaxy should feel the ram-pressure
almost immediately it enters the cluster In this work the SFR is
measured from H emission line which should reect the disap-
pearance of the star-formation activity almost instantaneously 50
Myr Furthermore galaxies which have been just accreted should
have a lower velocity ie galaxies increase their velocity as they
approach the cluster core falling into the gravitational potential
Therefore infalling galaxies cannot increase the velocity disper-
sion of star-forming late-type galaxies Also it has been reported
that majority of galaxies around the virial radius have already been
through the cluster core based on the computer simulations Moore
et al 2004 Mamon et al 2004 Therefore it is an unlikely possi-
bility that statistical number of star-forming galaxies happen to be
star-forming since they have been just accreted and yet to feel the
stripping In case of the hot gas stripping starvation the timescale
is longer a few Gyr Treu et al 2003 and star-forming late-type
galaxies may be still before transformation However the existence
of passive late-type galaxies with small velocity dispersion cannot
be explained by the hot gas stripping neither The pressure should
be still stronger for galaxies with high velocity even in the case of
the hot gas stripping
On the other hand the observed trend is perfectly consistent
with the dynamical interactionfriction models Icke 1985 Lavery
 Henry 1988 Mamon 1992 Bekki 1998 If dynamical interac-
tion between galaxies is responsible for cluster galaxy evolution
such interaction happens more frequently when relative velocity of
galaxies are smaller eg Ostriker 1980 Mamon 1992 being con-
sistent with passive late-type galaxies having smaller velocity dis-
persion than bluer counterparts Also dynamical friction between
galaxies can reduce velocity distributing well-evolved galaxies
passive early-types at the center of the gravitational potential as
seen in subsection 32

In the literature supportive evidence can be found It is re-
ported that spiral galaxies have greater velocity dispersion than el-
lipticals in nearby clusters Sodre et al 1989 Stein 1997 Adami et
al 19982000 Emission line galaxies are also found to have larger
velocity dispersion in ENACS clusters Biviano et al 1997 and in
2dFGRS Lares et al 2004 Although these studies did not com-
bine morphological and colour information from which we have
obtained critical evidence against the ram-pressure stripping all of
the above studies are consistent with our ndings and thus can be
considered as supporting our own ndings
For many years it has been difcult to specify the responsible
physical mechanism for the cluster galaxy evolution However we
have obtained crucial information on the stripping model by com-
bining colour and morphological information together It is impor-
tant to extend the analysis presented in this paper to high redshift
clusters where more galaxy evolution are on-going
5 CONCLUSION
By taking advantage of the large number of spectra available in the
SDSS DR2 we have constructed a composite galaxy cluster with
an extremely large number of 14548 member galaxies providing an
opportunity to measure velocity dispersion of various subsample
of member galaxies in unprecedented precision Our ndings are
following
i We found that massive galaxies brighter in Mz have
smaller velocity dispersion Fig 1 This is a direct evidence
of massive galaxies losing their velocity by dynamical interac-
tionfriction between galaxies through the energy equipartition
ii We found that star-forming late-type galaxies have larger
velocity dispersion than passive late-type galaxies Since the ram-
pressure is proportional to v2 this is an evidence against the ram-
pressure stripping models being responsible for the cluster galaxy
evolution Dynamical interactionfriction between galaxies is more
