THE REDSHIFT EVOLUTION OF THE RELATION BETWEEN STELLAR MASS
STAR FORMATION RATE AND GAS METALLICITY OF GALAXIES
YUU NIINO 1
Draft version October 18 2012
ABSTRACT
We investigate the relation between stellar mass M star formation rate SFR and metallicity Z of galax-
ies so called the fundamental metallicity relation in the galaxy sample of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data
Release 7 We separate the galaxies into narrow redshift bins and compare the relation at different redshifts and
nd statistically signicant  99 evolution We test various observational effects that might cause seeming
Z evolution and nd it difcult to explain the evolution of the relation only by the observational effects In
the current sample of low redshift galaxies galaxies with different M and SFR are sampled from different
redshifts and there is degeneracy between MSFR and redshift Hence it is not straightforward to distinguish
a relation between Z and SFR from a relation between Z and redshift The separation of the intrinsic relation
from the redshift evolution effect is a crucial issue to understand evolution of galaxies

1 INTRODUCTION
2 THE GALAXY SAMPLE
Stellar mass M star formation rate SFR and metal-
licity Z of galaxies are essential parameters to under-
stand evolution of galaxies eg Kauffmann et al 2003a
Brinchmann et al 2004 Tremonti et al 2004 Salim et al
2007 The relation between M and Z has been studied at var-
ious redshifts eg Tremonti et al 2004 Savaglio et al 2005
Erb et al 2006 Liu et al 2008 Ellison et al 2008 added
the 3rd parameter to the MZ relation and found the 3D cor-
relation between M SFR and Z of eld star forming galax-
ies at low redshifts z  01 in the Sloan Digital Sky Sur-
vey SDSS galaxy sample Recently Mannucci et al 2010
hereafter M10 and Lara-Lpez et al 2010 showed that high
redshift galaxies z  3 agree with the extrapolation of the
MSFRZ relation dened at low redshifts so called the fun-
damental metallicity relation
The no-evolution of the MSFRZ relation with redshift
suggests existence of a physical process which affects evolu-
tion of galaxies in the wide range of redshift behind the re-
lation Some models are already proposed to explain the ori-
gin of the MSFRZ relation Dav et al 2012 Dayal et al
2012 Yates et al 2012
Although the correlation between M SFR and Z is
tested at various redshifts M10 Lara-Lpez et al 2010
Richard et al 2011 Yabe et al 2011 Nakajima et al 2012
Cresci et al 2012 Wuyts et al 2012 galaxies observed at
different redshifts typically have different M and SFR Hence
the comparison of galaxy metallicities at different redshifts in
a same range of M and SFR is hardly done Thus it is cur-
rently difcult to distinguish a fundamental relation between
M SFR and Z that stands in wide range of redshift from a
series of the MZ relations at various redshifts
In this study we separate the low redshift galaxy sample
z  03 in which the MSFRZ relation is dened into nar-
row redshift bins and investigate redshift evolution of the re-
lation Throughout this paper we assume the ducial cosmol-
ogy with   07 m  03 and H0  70 km s- 1 Mpc- 1

We draw galaxies for our analysis from the SDSS MPA-
JHU Data Release 7 catalog2 hereafter the MPA-JHU cat-
alog with similar selection criteria to that in M10 as fol-
lows We select galaxies 1 at redshifts between 007 and
03 2 the signal-to-noise ratio SN of H line  25 3
AV  25 4 H to H ux ratio HH  25 and 5
not strongly affected by active galactic nuclei AGN accord-
ing to Kauffmann et al 2003b These selection criteria are
identical to those in M10
The target galaxy selection method for the spectroscopic
observation in the SDSS provides highly uniform and com-
plete sample of galaxies above applied magnitude limit that
is r-band Petrosian magnitude mrPet  1777 Strauss et al
2002 However galaxies fainter than this limit which have
been selected by different selection methods eg luminous
red galaxy sample Eisenstein et al 2001 are also included in
the MPA-JHU catalog To avoid possible selection effect in
those galaxies we impose following selection criteria in ad-
dition to the M10 criteria Galaxies in our sample 6 have
mrPet  1777 7 are selected for spectroscopic targets as
galaxy candidates Stoughton et al 2002 and 8 spectro-
scopically conrmed as galaxies by the SDSS spectroscopic
pipeline see the SDSS DR7 website3 for detail Finally
 110000 galaxies are left in our sample We note that 
90 of the galaxies in our sample is at z  015 although we
collect galaxies at redshifts up to 03
We use M and SFR of galaxies listed in the MPA-JHU
catalog Kauffmann et al 2003a Brinchmann et al 2004
Salim et al 2007 and measure metallicity of the galaxies us-
ing empirical method by Maiolino et al 2008 Following
M10 we use R23  OII3727OIII49585007H and
NII6584H as the indicators of metallicity The line ux
ratios are corrected for extinctions using HH and the ex-
tinction curve given by Cardelli et al 1989 When both in-
dicators are applicable to a galaxy we use mean of the 12 
logOH values given by the two indicators as far as the two
values agree with each other within 025 dex When the two

indicators disagree we remove the galaxy from our sample
Only 3 of galaxies in our sample is rejected here similarly
to the case in M10
3 CORRELATION OF SFR AND METALLICITY
We show the correlation between SFR and metallicity of the
galaxies in mass ranges log MM  100  005 1025 
005 105  005 1075  005 and 110  005 in gure 1
We separate the galaxies into SFR bins with log SFR  01
dex and measure median of metallicities in each bin The cor-
relation between SFR and metallicity is not clear among the
galaxies with log MM  105 the top three panels On
the other hand among the galaxies with log MM  1025
higher SFR galaxies have lower metallicity than lower SFR
galaxies the bottom two panels consistently to the results of
We also separate the galaxies into redshift bins with z 
002 and compare the SFRZ relations at different redshifts
gure 1 The plotted redshift bins are different in different
mass ranges due to the difference of redshift distribution of
the galaxies in each mass range the top panel of gure 2
Each data point in gure 1 contains more than 50 galaxies
Although systematic difference of the SFRZ relation at dif-
ferent redshifts is not clear in the mass ranges log MM 
1075 the galaxies with with log MM  105 show red-
shift evolution of the SFRZ relation
In the mass ranges log MM  105 galaxies with higher
SFR shows larger chemical evolution Making the negative
correlation between SFR and Z steeper at higher redshift The
low redshift sample of galaxies with log MM  105 shows
a positive correlation between SFR and Z which is consistent
to the results of Yates et al 2012 while the high redshift
galaxies with the same mass range shows the negative corre-
lation similarly to the case in lower mass ranges
As discussed in Brisbin  Harwit 2012 the extent of the
metallicity evolution with redshift shown in gure 1 is small
 005 dex due to the narrow redshift range we can investi-
gate with our sample However most datapoints which show
the redshift evolution in gure 1 have the error of mean  001
dex indicating that the evolution is statistically signicant We
discuss statistical signicance of the evolution of the relation
further in  41
It should be noted that a combination effect of ber cover-
ing fraction and metallicity gradient in a galaxy may cause
seeming metallicity evolution with redshift
In the SDSS
galaxy spectra are obtained only in the 3 arcsec ber aperture
The ber aperture can contain larger area of a target galaxy
at higher redshifts while galaxies tend to have lower metal-
licity in their outskirt than at their center eg Zaritsky et al
1994 We discuss this issue in  42 There are also other
observational effects that may affect the redshift evolution of
the MSFRZ relation The limiting magnitude of the SDSS
spectroscopic target selection mrPet  1777 andor the H
SN  25 threshold in our sample selection may cause some
redshift dependent sampling bias The larger noise in galaxy
spectra at higher redshift is also a possible source of articial
redshift effect We discuss these effects in  43 and  44
respectively
In gure 1
the galaxies with log MM  105 and
log SFR Myr- 1  05 show possible negative evolution of
metallicity higher metallicity at higher redshift although the
error of mean is large the sample size is small One pos-
sible explanation for the negative chemical evolution of the
low SFR galaxies is decrease of SFR in galaxies with high

SFR and low metallicity When SFR and metallicity are neg-
atively correlated some of high-SFR low-metallicity galax-
ies may decrease their SFR before signicant chemical evo-
lution decreasing the median metallicity of low SFR galaxies
while others continue star formation undergoing chemical en-
richment and increasing the median metallicity of high SFR
galaxies
To investigate the redshift evolution further we plot the me-
dian metallicities of the galaxies with log MM  105 
005 and various SFR as functions of redshift in gure 3
The metallicities of the high SFR galaxies log SFR Myr- 1
 05 is lower at higher redshifts while the metallicities of
the low SFR galaxies shows negative or no evolution con-
rming the results in gure 1
In the bottom panel of gure 2 we show redshift distribu-
tions of the galaxies with log MM  105 and log SFR
Myr- 1  02  08 The galaxies with different SFR are
sampled from different redshifts as well as in the case of dif-
ferent M shown in the top panel In gure 1 the SFRZ rela-
tions for the whole redshift range 007  z  03 follows the
low redshift relation in the low SFR end while metallicity of
the high SFR galaxies follows the high redshift relation con-
sistently to the difference of the redshift distributions between
the low and high SFR galaxies
4 DISCUSSION
41 Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
To examine the signicance of the redshift evolution we
nd in  3 we perform the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov
KS test which calculates the probability that two samples
can be drawn from a same probability distribution function
In gure 4 we show metallicity distributions of the galaxies
with the four sets of M and SFR which show notable redshift
evolution in gure 1 at two different redshifts each
The positive metallicity evolution lower-metallicity at
higher-redshift in the mass ranges log MM  105 is sta-
tistically signicant to high condence level  99 the top
3 panels of gure 4 The statistical signicance of the evo-
lution of the galaxies with log MM  1025 and 105 is
very high with the KS test probability PKS  77  10- 13 and
21  10- 7
Although the statistical signicance of the evolution of the
galaxies with log MM  100 is lower than in the cases
of the galaxies with log MM  1025 and 105 due to
the very narrow range of redshift where we can investigate
log MM  100 galaxies the evolution in this mass range is
also larger than statistical error PKS  15  10- 3 The extent
of the evolution of the galaxies with log MM  100 is sim-
ilar to that of the log MM  105 galaxies  003 dex al-
though the redshift range investigated is 3 times smaller This
suggests that less massive galaxies are more rapidly evolving
in metallicity consistently to the ndings of previous stud-
ies eg Savaglio et al 2005 but see also Lamareille et al
The possible negative metallicity evolution of the high-
mass low-SFR galaxies is statistically less signicant than
the positive evolution of the high SFR galaxies the bottom
panel of gure 4 as expected from the large error of mean in
gure 1
42 The Effect of Fiber Covering Fraction
The combination effect of ber covering fraction and metal-
licity gradient in a galaxy may cause seeming metallicity evo-
lution with redshift The SDSS spectroscopic ber 3 arcsec
contains larger area of a target galaxy at higher redshift and
galaxies tend to have lower metallicity in their outskirt than at
their center eg Zaritsky et al 1994
We show the relation between the ber covering fraction
the ber to total ux ratio in r-band and the derived metal-
licity of the galaxies with log MM  105 and log SFR
Myr- 1  08 in gure 5 The galaxies with larger covering
fraction have higher-metallicity contrary to what is expected
from the metallicity gradient This trend may be a result of
the negative correlation between galaxy radius and metallic-
ity found by Ellison et al 2008 The absence of the expected
negative correlation between the ber covering fraction and
the metallicity suggests that the ber covering fraction is de-
termined by intrinsic size of galaxies rather than their redshift
We note that the galaxies have signicant variation of radus
615 kpc Petrosian even in the narrow bin of M and SFR
It should be noted that the gradient effect may be hidden in
gure 5 canceled by the effect of the radiusmetallicity cor-
relation and hence the absence of the gradient effect in the
plot doesnt completely rule out the effect However if the
redshift evolution of metallicity results from the effect of the

FIG 4 The cumulative metallicity distributions of the galaxies with the
four sets of M and SFR at low and high redshifts The top 3 panels show the
high SFR galaxies whose metallicity is lower at higher redshift while the bot-
tom panel shows the low SFR galaxies whose metallicity is possibly higher
at higher redshift In each panel solid and dashed histograms represent low
and high redshift samples respectively The plotted redshifts are different for
different set of M and SFR due to the difference of the redshift distributions
of the galaxies with different M and SFR see gure 2
metallicity gradient we expect larger evolution for galaxies
with larger radius and the gradient Considering that galaxies
with larger M tend to have larger radius and dwarf galaxies
have atter metallicity gradient than spirals eg Lee et al
2006 the nding of the metallicity evolution only in high
specic SFR galaxies is opposite to the expected trend in the
case of the gradient effect Hence we consider it is difcult to
explain the metallicity evolution found in this study only by
the effect of the metallicity gradient
43 Continuum and H Line Luminosity Limits
As mentioned in  2 the SDSS spectroscopic target galax-
ies are magnitude limited mrPet  1777 and we select galax-
ies with H SN  25 for this study Hence the broad band
limiting magnitude andor the H ux limit may cause some
redshift dependent sampling bias
In gure 6 we plot Mr and H luminosity distributions of
the galaxies with log MM  105 and log SFR Myr- 1
 08 at redshift 008 and 014 With the xed M and SFR
the galaxies at z  014 are clearly brighter than the z  008
galaxies in r-band suggesting that the r-band limiting magni-
tude plays an important role in this sample On the other hand
the H luminosity distributions at the two different redshifts
are not largely different We note that galaxies with log SFR
Myr- 1  08 typically have H SN  60 at z  014 and
log MstarMsun  105 log SFR Msunyr-1  08

FIG 5 The median the 1 scatter and the error of mean of the galaxy
metallicities with log MM  105 and log SFR Myr- 1  08 as a func-
tion of the ber covering fraction Here the ber covering fraction is the ratio
of ux in ber to total ux of the object measured in r-band The width of
the ber covering fraction bins is 01 dex
hence few galaxies in this SFR range are rejected by the H
SN limit by the H SN threshold
To discuss the effect of the limiting magnitude we plot dis-
tributions of the galaxies with log MM  105 in some red-
shift bins on the SFR versus r-band mass-to-luminosity ratio
MLr plane and the metallicity versus MLr plane in
gure 7
In the left panel of gure 7 MLr of the galaxies clearly
correlates with SFR causing the difference of redshift distri-
bution between the galaxy samples with different SFR the
bottom panel of gure 2 On the other hand no clear cor-
relation between metallicity and MLr is seen in the right
panel Furthermore it is also notable that galaxies at higher
redshifts have systematically lower metallicity than lower red-
shift galaxies with similar MLr
To test the effect of the limiting magnitude further we
separate the galaxies with log MM  105 and log SFR
Myr- 1  08 at redshift 008 into two subsamples One is
bright Mr  - 215 and the other is faint Mr  215 We
compare the metallicity distributions of the brightfaint sam-
ples at z  008 and the sample at z  014 in gure 8 The
galaxies in the bright sample at z  008 have similar Mr to
the galaxies at z  014 Although the bright sample is small
the KS test between the bright sample and the z  014 sample
indicates the metallicity distributions of the two sample is sig-
nicantly different PKS  0037 while the faint sample and
the bright sample is broadly consistent PKS  031 Hence
it is unlikely that the limiting magnitude effect is the primary
source of the redshift evolution of the MSFRZ relation
44 Noise Effect and Mean Spectra
With similar M and SFR spectra of high redshift galax-
ies would have lower SN than those of low redshift galaxies
This expected trend possibly affect the metallicity estimate in
a redshift dependent way We also note that gure 6 suggests
that high redshift galaxies have smaller H equivalent width
than low redshift galaxies and hence it is possible that high
redshift galaxies suffer more from uncertainties of the con-
tinuum subtraction than low redshift galaxies To reduce the
noise effect we compose mean spectra of the galaxies with
log MM  105  005 and log SFR Myr- 1  08  005
at redshifts 008 001 010 001 012 001 014 001
and 016  001 and measure NII6584H and R23 of the

mean spectrum at each redshift
We average spectra collected from the SDSS data archive
server4 after shifting wavelength to the center of each red-
shift bin To reduce the effect of stellar absorption lines on
the emission line measurement we t continuum of the mean
spectra with stellar spectral energy distribution SED mod-
els and subtract the stellar component models form the mean
spectra We perform the SED tting with the SEDt software
package Sawicki 2012 Sawicki  Yee 1998 which utilize
the population synthesis models of Bruzual  Charlot 2003
We examine ve cases of star formation history simple stellar
population constant star formation and exponentially decay-
ing star formation with   02 10 and 50 Gyr assuming
stellar metallicity to be Z
Two mean spectra and their best t stellar SED models are
shown in the left panel of gure 9 The mean spectra achieves
very high SN typically  100 in the highest redshift bin
The best t parameters of the stellar SED models indicate
smaller M and SFR than log MM  105 and log SFR
Myr- 1  08 but we note that the spectra only represents
stellar populations in the spectroscopic ber In the right panel
of gure 9 we show a close up view of high order Balmer
lines in the mean spectra Although the center of each ab-
sorption line is affected by the corresponding emission line
the stellar SED models reproduce Balmer absorption lines in
their wings
After subtracting the stellar SED models we t each line
with linear continuum plus single gaussian to measure ux of
each line we t OII3727 doublet with linear continuum
plus double gaussian We show the line ttings at z  008
and 014 in gure 10 and 11 When normalized to the peaks
of the gaussian models of H the spectrum at z  008 has
slightly stronger NII6584 than the spectrum at z  014
gure 10 We also t NII6548 to avoid that the line
4 httpdassdssorgwwwhtml
affects the estimate of the residual continuum although we
dont use the line as a metallicity indicator One can also
nd that OII3727 is slightly weaker at z  008 than at
z  014 gure 11 contrary to the case of NII6584 We
note that the continuum level underneath OII3727 may be
affected by high order Balmer emission lines whose peaks are
not resolved in the mean spectra and it may affect R23 while
NIIH is free from this effect
The line uxes obtained by the gaussian t are listed in ta-
ble 1 after corrected for extinction using HH ratio and the
Cardelli et al 1989 extinction curve The redshift evolution
of the metal indicating line ratios is plotted in gure 12 to-
gether with the median line ratios of the galaxies with the
same M SFR and redshift to those of the mean spectra Note
that the line uxes of the mean spectra are obtained by our
gaussian t while the median line ratios are obtained using
the line uxes listed in the MPA-JHU catalog
Galaxies at higher redshifts show smaller NIIH and
larger R23 in their mean spectra The relations between
the line ratios and Z are dlogNIIHdlogZ  081 and
dlogR23dlogZ  - 15 at 12  logOH  90 Maiolino et al
2008 and hence the evolution of the line ratios in gure 12
is broadly consistent to the metallicity evolution found in  3
The median line ratios also evolve with similar manner to the
line ratios of the mean spectra although they indicate smaller
metal-to-hydrogen line ratio than the results with the mean
spectrum possibly due to the difference of spectrum tting
method Thus we conclude that the metallicity evolution is
not a result of noise effect
5 SUMMARY
We have investigated the evolution of the MSFRZ re-
lation at z  03 Although the redshift range we investi-
gated is narrow we found metallicity of the high SFR galaxies
log SFR Myr- 1  05 with log MM  105 is evolv-
ing with  99 statistical signicance We have examined
the observational effects which may cause seeming evolution
of metallicity the ber aperture effect the sampling bias by
the limiting magnitude and the noise in the spectra We found
it is difcult to explain the evolution of the MSFRZ rela-
tion only by the observational effects although some effects
are not completely ruled out
In the current galaxy sample at low redshifts galaxies with
different M and SFR are sampled with different redshift dis-
tributions and there is a degeneracy between MSFR and
redshift Hence it is difcult to clearly separate SFR depen-
dence of metallicity from redshift dependence The metallic-
ity evolution of galaxies with same M and SFR at z  03
found in this study suggests that the currently known M
SFRZ relation arises from a combination of the intrinsic re-
lation and the redshift evolution effect Previous studies eg
M10 Lara-Lpez et al 2010 showed that z  05 galaxies
agree with the extrapolation of the relation dened by z  03
galaxies suggesting that the relation is not evolving with red-
shift However if the redshift evolution effect is included in
the relation at z  03 the agreements of high redshift galaxies
dont necessarily mean that the relation is not evolving The
agreements may result from the extrapolation of the redshift
evolution effect
We need to investigate metallicity distribution of galaxies
with same M and SFR at different redshifts to distinguish the
intrinsic relation from the redshift evolution effect However
it is currently possible only for narrow range of M SFR and
redshift The extent of the evolution we nd in the current

FIG 8 The cumulative metallicity distributions of the galaxies with
log MM  105 and log SFR Myr- 1  08 at the two different red-
shifts The low redshift sample is separated into the bright Mr  - 215 and
the faint Mr  215 subsamples The galaxies in the bright sample have
similar Mr to that of the high redshift sample where faint galaxies are not
selected as spectroscopic targets The KS test probabilities between the dis-
tributions are indicated together
sample is very small due to the very narrow range of redshift
we can investigate Hence it is difcult to robustly exclude
possibility of systematic effects in our results
Deeper wide eld spectroscopic survey which covers wider
range of redshift is necessary to test the evolution effect more
robustly For example to study similar range of M and SFR
at z  1 with a comparable sample number or a survey vol-
ume  10 to this study the limiting magnitude must be
5 magnitude deeper than the SDSS sample m  23 and the
survey eld must be  20 deg2 03 of the SDSS DR7 eld
Note that the comoving volume element is  37 times larger
at z  1 than at z  01 Future spectroscopic surveys such
as Subaru Measurement of Images and Redshifts SuMIRe
project will achieve such requirements At redshifts z  1 the
limiting magnitude can be brighter but the survey eld must
be wider The robust separation of the intrinsic MSFRZ
relation from its evolution will open a new way to understand
galaxy evolution
