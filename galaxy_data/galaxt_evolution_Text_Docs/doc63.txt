Abstract We develop a toymodel for the chemical evolution of the
intracluster medium polluted by the galactic winds from elliptical galax-
ies The model follows the galaxy formation history of cluster galaxies
constrained by the observed luminosity function
Introduction
To account for the large amount of metals observed in the intracluster medium
ICM some non-standard stellar Initial Mass Function IMF has been often
invoked for cluster ellipticals such as a more topheavy IMF than the Salpeter
one Matteucci  Gibson 1995 Gibson  Matteucci 1997ab Loewenstein 
Mushotzky 1996 or a bimodal IMF with an early generation of massive stars
Arnaud et al 1992 Elbaz Arnaud  Vangioni-Flam 1995 see also the review
by Matteucci this conference A nonstandard IMF in ellipticals has been
suggested also on the base of other arguments a topheavy IMF best reproduces
their photometric properties Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 and sistematic variations
of the IMF in ellipticals of increasing mass might explain the observed trend
ML  L Larson 1986 Renzini  Ciotti 1993 Zepf  Silk 1996
Chiosi et al 1998 developed chemo-spectrophotometric models for ellipti-
cal galaxies with galactic winds adopting the variable IMF by Padoan Nordlund
 Jones 1997 hereinafter PNJ which is naturally skewed toward more massive
stars in the early galactic phases in more massive galaxies and for higher red-
shifts of formation see also Chiosi 2000 These galactic models were successful
at reproducing a number of spectrophotometric features of observed ellipticals
now an immediate question is what do these galactic models predict for the
pollution of the ICM through galactic winds GWs
2 Galactic wind ejecta PNJ vs Salpeter IMF
To address this issue Chiosi 2000 calculated multizone chemical models of
elliptical galaxies with the PNJ IMF together with models with the standard
Salpeter IMF for the sake of comparison Before discussing the resulting global
chemical evolution of the ICM lets inspect the dierent GW ejecta of the model
ellipticals when the two IMFs are adopted in turn

PNJ IMF thick lines and models with the Salpeter IMF thin lines

tary fraction locked into stars dashed lines as a function of the initial
mass of the galaxy for four dierent redshifts of formation as indicated
Rightmost panel metallicity of the gas ejected as GW by galaxies of
given initial baryonic mass indicated in the plots and as a function of
their redshift of formation
In Fig 1 left panels we compare the mass fraction of gas ejected in the GW
and the complementary mass fraction locked into stars for galactic models with
the variable PNJ IMF and for models with the Salpeter IMF thick and thin
lines respectively Mass fractions refer to the total initial baryonic mass of the
galaxy The amount of ejected gas is larger in the case of the PNJ IMF since in
the early galactic phases this IMF is skewed toward more massive stars and less
mass remains locked into longlived low-mass stars The dierence with the
Salpeter case gets sharper for larger galactic masses and for higher redshifts of
formation Models with the Salpeter IMF evidently bear no dependence on the
redshift of formation
The rightmost panel in Fig 1 shows the iron abundances in the gas ejected
as GW again comparing the Salpeter IMF and the PNJ IMF case
In most
cases the galactic ejecta in the PNJ models are more metalrich than in the
Salpeter case up to a factor of 5 or more for the more massive galaxies and for
high redshifts of formation In the PNJ models in fact more gas in the galaxy
gets recycled through massive stars eective metal contributors while less gas
gets locked into lowmass stars
From the trends described above we expect galactic models with the PNJ
IMF to predict for the ICM a more ecient metal pollution and a higher
fraction of the gas originating from GWs with respect to standard models
The rst results in this respect are discussed in Chiosi 2000
A chemical evolution model for galaxy clusters
3 The chemical evolution of the ICM a toy model
Since the GW ejecta of ellipticals modelled with the PNJ IMF are sensitive to the
detailed redshift of formation of the individual galaxies to predict the chemical
enrichment of the ICM we need to model the history of galaxy formation in the
cluster To this aim we developed a global self-consistent chemical model for
the cluster which can follow the simultaneous evolution of all its components
the galaxies the primordial gas and the gas processed and re-ejected via GWs
Moretti et al 2001 Our chemical model for clusters is developed in analogy
with the usual chemical models for galaxies as illustrated in the scheme below
primordial gas
primordial gas
SFR IMF
GFR GIMF
stellar yields
galaxies
GW yields
enriched gas
enriched gas
As the interstellar medium ISM is polluted by stars the ICM is polluted by
galaxies The primordial gas in the ICM gets consumed in time by some pre-
scribed Galactic Formation Rate GFR at each time galaxies form distributed
in mass according to a Galactic Initial Mass Function GIMF derived from the
Press-Schechter mass function suited to that redshift Through GWs galaxies
restitute chemically enriched gas which mixes with the overall ICM the latter
consists of the primordial gas not yet consumed by galaxy formation if any
and of the gas re-ejected by galaxies up to the present age
Model equation parallel those of galactic chemical models with the substitu-
tions SFR  GFR IMF  Press-Schechter GIMF stellar yields  GW yields
Model parameters are calibrated so that the resulting galaxy formation history
matches the observed presentday luminosity function LF at the end of the
simulation For all details see Moretti et al 2001
4 The best case models
In Fig 2 we show our case of best match with the observed LF in the Bband
Trentham 1998 top panels The left panels refer to the case when galactic
models with the PNJ IMF are adopted the right panels display results for
the same cluster parameters ie same galaxy formation history but adopting
ellipticals with the Salpeter IMF The Salpeter case predicts somewhat more
galaxies in the highluminosity bins due to the fact that for massive galaxies a
larger mass fraction remains locked into stars in the Salpeter case than with the
PNJ IMF cf Fig 1 Anyways the LF is still in agreement with the observed
one within errors
Although the predicted LF is virtually the same in the two models strong
dierences are found in the predicted gas and metallicity content in the ICM

A chemical evolution model for galaxy clusters
The mid panels in Fig 2 show the predicted abundance evolution in the ICM
Adopting galactic models with the PNJ IMF clearly improves predictions about
the metallicity of the ICM
The bottom panels in Fig 2 show the evolution of the mass fraction of the
various components of the cluster the primordial gas which gets consumed by
galaxy formation the processed gas namely the gas that has been involved in
galaxy formation and then re-ejected as GW the total gas sum of the primordial
and of the processed gas the mass in galaxies that is in the stellar component we
see today left over after the GW While in the Salpeter case right panel the
overall mass that remains locked into galaxies longdashed line is larger that
the mass ejected in the GWs dotted line the opposite is true for the cluster
model with the PNJ galaxies left panel as qualitatively expected from  2 In
the latter case the mass of the re-ejected gas is  15 times larger than that
locked into galaxies Although this is not enough to account for the whole of the
observed intra-cluster gas whith a mass 25 times larger than that in galaxies
Arnaud et al 1992 the amount of gas re-ejected by galaxies is expected to
make up for a remarkable fraction of the overall ICM
5 Open issues and future perspectives
Once the model is calibrated to reproduce the observed LF in the Bband Fig 2
top panels it turns out that the match with LFs in redder bands is not as good
Fig 3 left panel shows the comparison to the observed LF in the Rband the
bestcase model calibrated on the Bband seems to underestimate the number
of luminous galaxies with a red stellar population A similar eect is seen for
the LF in the Kband We used the Bband LF for the calibration as it oered
the deepest and most extensive dataset but the LF in the red bands is probably
a better track of the old stellar population responsible for the bulk of the metal
enrichment while the Bband might be sensitive to recent minor bursts of star
formation Hence calibrating the model over the red stellar population should
provide a better estimate of the galaxy formation history and of the consequent
chemical enrichment of the ICM
In particular a larger number of old giant galaxies will help to obtain higher
values of the Iron Mass to Light Ratio IMLR for a denition see Renzini 1997
and references therein closer to the very high IMLRs measured in real clusters
 001 Finoguenov David  Ponman 2000 To illustrate this point in the
right panel of Fig 3 we plot the presentday IMLR of individual ellipticals
modelled with the PNJ IMF as a function of the initial mass of the galaxy
and for dierent redshifts of formation Higher values of the IMLR pertain to
more massive and older galaxies With the PNJ IMF in fact galaxies which are
more massive andor formed at higher redshifts store less mass in the stellar
component while ejecting more and more metalrich gas in the GW Fig 1
and  2 both eects tend to enhance the corresponding IMLR
Hence with a galaxy formation history producing more red giant galaxies
in the cluster mixture as suggested by the LFs in the red bands we expect
to predict high values for the overall IMLR in the cluster
