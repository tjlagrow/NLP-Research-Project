ABSTRACT
Aims This paper presents a principal components analysis of rotation curves from
a sample of low surface brightness galaxies The physical meaning of the principal
components is investigated and related to the intrinsic properties of the galaxies
Methods The rotation curves are re-scaled using the optical disk scale the resulting
principal component decomposition demonstrates that the whole sample is properly
approximated using two components
Results The ratio of the second to the rst component is related to the halo steepness in
the central region is correlated to the gas fraction in the galaxy and is un-correlated to
other parameters As a consequence the gas fraction appear as a fundamental variable
with respect to the galaxies rotation curves and its correlation with the halo steepness
is especially important
Conclusions Since the gas fraction is related to the degree of galaxy evolution it is very
likely that the steepness of the halo at the center is a consequence of galaxy evolution
More evolved galaxies have shallower central prole and statistically less gas most
likely as a consequence of more star formation and supernovae The dierences in
evolution gas fractions and halo central steepness of the galaxies could be due to the
inuence of dierent environments

scenario but will focus on analyzing rotation curves data without preconceived hypothesis
The approach will focus on isolating the fundamental features in the rotation curves and
will relate them to the intrinsic physical parameters of low surface brightness galaxies
2 Data analysis
de Blok  Bosma 2002 hereafter dBB published the rotation curves of 26 LSB The
dBB sample contains galaxies of dierent sizes and masses requiring the re-scaling of the
rotations curves In practice the rotation curves were re-scaled using the length scale in-
ferred from the visible light Table 1 in dBB Provided the various rotation curves are
related to the same universal physical process the re-scaled curves should be reducible to
a minimal set of fundamental components The reduction to a minimal set is equivalent
to a principal component analysis PCA The PCA requires a re-sampling of the curves
to a common grid this re-sampling was performed using B-spline interpolation The PCA
vectors are re-constructed in the range Rpc in re-scaled units The range Rpc must in-
clude a sucient number of points a minimum of 5 points was required An additional
requirement was the availability of an estimation of the HI contribution to the rotation
curve The contribution of the gas was subtracted to the mass budget The range Rpc was
adjusted to be as large as possible while maximizing the number of curves The optimal
value is Rpc  285 which corresponds to a total of 15 curves Since the mass scale like the
square of the velocity the PCA is performed on the square of the velocity data Finally the
amplitudes of the curves were re-normalized so that their self cross product is unity The
PCA matrix is constructed by lling the matrix columns with the rotation curve vectors
PCA requires to nd the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix numerically this is best
achieved by using a singular value decomposition of the matrix Components are sorted by
descending order of power spectrum contribution see Fig 1
21 Eect of noise on the PCA analysis
Numerical experiments performed using Monte-Carlo simulations with gaussian noise ex-
pectations on the velocities as provided by dBB indicates that the amplitude of the noise
on the power spectrum of each components sums of the square of amplitudes for each
vector normalized by total power is about 00352 As a consequence only the rst two
components are signicant see Fig 1 2 Another problem is the stability of these two
components with respect to the noise uctuations and the re-scaling errors Random gaus-
sian noise with variance taken from dBB were added to the set of light curves and the
singular value decomposition was re-computed each time in order to estimate the eect
of noise on the principal components The result of 1000 simulations shows that the noise
accounts for about 05 of the total variance on the rst component and 15 of the to-
tal variance on the second component These numerical experiments shows also that only
a linear interpolation of the rotation curves is stable numerically Lets now investigate
the errors introduced by the re-scaling of the rotation curves The curves were re-scaled
C Alard Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
according to the disk scale length but there is no guaranty that the scale of the other com-
ponents are exactly proportional to the disk scale To evaluate the eects of uncertainty
in the re-scaling uniform random uctuations of the scale length were introduced and the
PCA was re-conducted each time The results shows that for uniform deviations of the scale
length with respective amplitudes of 10 20 and 40 the corresponding variance of the
noise as a fraction of the total variance of the second components is 2 4 and 9 In
addition to these results note that the mean correlation coecients between the simulated
second component and the original one is 09 when noise uctuations are considered and
higher for scale uctuations The rst components is much less aected and has a mean
correlation close to unity As a conclusion the results on the statistical variance and the
correlation are a good illustration of the stability of the PCA analysis of this sample
22 Interpretation of the components
The rst component represents approximately the mean of all curves The meaning of the
second component is easily understood by evaluating its eect on the shape of the curves
Adding a fraction of the second component to the rst component inuence the power law
approximation of the curve Adding 20  of the second component to the rst component
corresponds to a power law approximation with exponent  15 while subtraction the same
amount corresponds to an exponent of  05 As a consequence the ratio of the second
component to the rst component is also related to the steepness of the density prole
or equivalently to the concentration of mass at the center This analysis is conrmed by
the strong correlation observed between the mass concentration ratio of mass to 1 scale
unit to mass at 3 scale units and the ratio between the components As a consequence
the variations in shape of the rotation in the dBB sample are related to a variation in the
concentration of mass at the center
3 Relation between rotation curve and and galaxy physics
The rotation curves of the dBB sample are properly approximated with two PCA compo-
nents and the ratio of these components  is associated with the concentration of mass

mates the Spearman correlation coecient and the a linear least-square t with errors
in both directions To evaluate the signicance of the correlation the probability that the
Spearman correlation coecient is dierent from zero is computed However the problem is
complicated by the fact that each point of a given curve has a dierent variance Thus the
Spearman correlation analysis should be considered as an evaluation of the real correlation
between the variable Another type of analysis that would take into account the dierent
variance of the data points is to t a straight line and estimate the statistical signicance
that the slope is dierent from zero The statistical errors on the dierent variable and

square minimization with errors in both variable is conducted Press 2007 The chi-square

an intrinsic noise in the relation between the variables are present It is assumed that this
intrinsic noise amplitude  is constant whatever the galaxy The value of  is unknown
and must be estimated from the data  A rough estimate of  can be obtained by requiring
that the chi-square is reduced to unity for the relevant value of   0 The real value of

Fig 2 The rst two components presented together with linear combinations of the com-
ponents illustrating the eect of the second component on the rotation curves
is that the mass budget considered in this analysis include also the stellar disk Does the
contribution from the stellar disk introduces a correlation in the variable that would be
mistakenly attributed to the dark halo  The correlation that we observe is that galaxies
with larger gas fractions are more centrally concentrated On the other hand the gas is
converted into stars thus a higher gas fraction is expected to corresponds to lower stellar
content As a consequence in galaxies with a higher gas fraction the stellar disk is expected
to contribute less to the mass budget Thus the eect of the stellar disk is in an opposite
direction with respect to the observed correlation between the gas fraction and  It is
interesting to point that the assumed correlation between higher gas fraction and lower
stellar fraction SM  is conrmed by analyzing the dBB sample The Pearson correlation
coecient between the stellar fraction and the gas fraction is is -053 which corresponds
to a chance of only 4 that the variable are un-correlated Note that to derive the stellar
fraction the stellar mass was normalized by a mean statistical mass MS for the galaxy
which was derived by tting the data MS  h16
R  This normalization was preferred to a
normalization by the total mass extrapolated from the rotation curve because it introduces
less noise Fitting a straight line using the procedure already described for the gas fraction
and  demonstrates that the association is signicant to more than 3  Note also that by
taking into account the relation between the gas fraction and the stellar fraction and the
relation between the gas fraction and  one can infer the relation between the stellar frac-
tion and  The inferred slope is consistent with the data no correlation is found between
the data but this is due to the fact that inferred slope is small with respect to the noise

4 Discussion
The shape of galaxy rotation curve and the mass concentration at the center are related
to  Furthermore  is related to the the gas fraction in the dBB sample The parameter
 is also closely related to mass model tting of the rotation curves see Fig 4 Negative
values of  are associated with more concentrated mass prole shorter Burkert scale length
and better consistency with a NFW prole when compared to positive values of  As a
consequence gas rich galaxies will be also associated with shorter Burkert scale and will
be closer to a NFW prole Note that this association cannot be due to a systematic
bias related to the mass of the galaxies One could think that more massive galaxies have
steeper prole and more gas because the self gravity is stronger and more easily overcome
the supernovae winds However since no correlation between mass and  is observed this
systematic bias is unlikely Actually the eect of stronger gravity in more massive system
could be compensated by more ecient star formation Kim 2007 found that the gas
C Alard Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length
mass fraction is correlated to the ratio of current to past average star formation The
results of Kim 2007 shows that the gas fraction is related to the evolution of galaxies gas
poor galaxies had more stellar formation in the past than gas rich galaxies with respect
to current star formation Statistically the gas rich galaxies are less evolved have lower
stellar fractions and have a better consistency with NFW proles Provided that the initial
dark matter prole is close to a NFW prole the eect of galaxy evolution via supernovae
explosions is to form shallower proles with nearly constant density cores Larson 1974
Read  Gilmore 2005 Governato et al 2010 The eect of tidal encounter may boost
galaxy evolution and inuence the mass prole Mayer et al 2001 Hayashi et al 2003
Galaxies interaction may also increase the star formation rate and inuence the stellar
mass function Habergham et al 2010 Star formation Galaxy interactions and other
eects related to galaxy evolution attens the inner mass prole and in the same time
reduce the gas fraction fraction in the galaxy The relation between mass prole and gas
fraction is thus most likely a correlation between galaxy evolution and mass prole We
observe an evolutionary sequence where galaxies with a larger gas fraction are less evolved
than gas poor galaxies It is likely that gas poor galaxies were subject to more interactions
with other galaxies boosting stellar formation and supernovae while at the same time the
tidal interaction has also some inuence on the mass prole An analysis of SDSS data by
Rosenbaum  Bomans 2004 shows that gas rich LSB forms in the voids and that some
migrated to the edge of laments while others remain in the voids This scenario implies
that LSB galaxies had less tidal interaction than other brighter galaxies but the level of
tidal interaction encountered by a given LSB galaxy is as variable as the neighborhood
of the galaxy is even if they form in relatively void regions some encounters are still
likely and those galaxies who later fall on more densely populated areas receive more tidal
interaction than others This would explain the dierences of evolution in this sample and
the corresponding dierences in the rotation curves and mass proles
