ABSTRACT
Dierent compositions of galaxy types in the eld in comparison to galaxy clusters as de-
scribed by the morphology-density relation in the local universe is interpreted as a result of
transformation processes from late- to early-type galaxies This interpretation is supported by
the Butcher-Oemler eect We investigate EA galaxies as an intermediate state between late-
type galaxies in low density environments and early-type galaxies in high density environment
to constrain the possible transformation processes
For this purpose we model a grid of post-starburst galaxies by inducing a burst and or a
halting of star formation on the normal evolution of spiral galaxies with our galaxy evolution
code GALEV From our models we nd that the common EA criteria exclude a signicant
number of post-starburst galaxies and propose that comparing their spectral energy distribu-
tions leads to a more sucient method to investigate post-starbust galaxies We predict that
a higher number of EA galaxies in the early universe can not be ascribed solely to a higher
number of starburst but is a result of a lower metallicity and a higher burst strength due to
more gas content of the galaxies in the early universe We nd that even galaxies with a normal
evolution without a starburst have a H-strong phase at early galaxy ages

1 INTRODUCTION
The composition of galaxy types is dierent in the eld low
galaxy density environments as compared to galaxy clusters
high galaxy density environment In the local universe this eg
is described by the morphology-density MD relation Dressler
1980 Oemler 1974 The higher the projected surface density
of galaxies within an area the higher is the fraction of early-
type galaxies and the lower is the fraction of late-type galaxies
Dressler et al 1997 The eld is rich in spirals and irregular
galaxies while in clusters mainly S0s dSphs and dEs are found
Butcher and Oemler were the rst to report a high fraction of
blue galaxies in distant clusters as compared to local ones BO ef-
fect see Butcher  Oemler 1984 1978 Ellingson et al 2001
Kodama  Bower 2001 Since galaxy clusters grow by contin-
uous accretion of the eld galaxies this dierence is not caused
by dierent formation histories but is due to a transformation that
takes place during the lifetime of a galaxy Couch et al 1994
Dressler et al 1994 This interpretation is supported by ndings
that the fraction of ellipticals remains constant in clusters of dier-
ent redshift while the fraction of spirals increases and the fraction

of S0 galaxies correspondingly decreases with increasing redshift
see Fasano et al 2000 When galaxies encounter a high density
environment like a galaxy cluster the star formation SF is sup-
pressed causing an evolution from late to early spectral types for
these galaxies This shows that environment plays a crucial role in
the evolution of galaxies While in earlier times it was believed that
galaxy transformation takes only place in clusters and is related
to the Intra Cluster Medium ICM today we know that galaxy
properties like the SF activity the H i content and morphologi-
cal type depend on the local galaxy density in general and the
ICM cannot be the only explanation to it When spectra of the
blue population of galaxies in clusters were investigated most BO
galaxy spectra showed strong emission lines typical of blue star
forming galaxies However some of the blue galaxies were discov-
ered to show spectra with strong Balmer absorption lines but no
emission lines Couch  Sharples 1987 These spectra are dier-
ent from the spectra of any normal Hubble type galaxy and were
named EA galaxies In many clusters these EA galaxies con-
stitute a large fraction of the blue galaxy population Barger et al
1996 Poggianti  Barbaro 1996 Some red galaxies in clusters
were also discovered to show strong Balmer absorption lines This
eect is called the spectroscopic BO-eect X-ray observations
have shown that EA galaxies can be found near the edges of in-
falling structures in clusters located in an area between early-type

galaxies in the central cluster regions and late-type galaxies in the
eld and cluster outskirts Poggianti et al 2004 Investigations of
Helmboldt 2007 show that the gas content of EA galaxies on av-
erage lies between gas-rich disk galaxies and typical gas poor ES0
galaxies
Several processes have been proposed as mechanisms for the
transformation of galaxies in cluster environments The most com-
mon ones are mergers harassment gas stripping and strangula-
tion Harassment is an eect of tidal forces caused by a series of
many weak galaxy-galaxy encounters with high relative velocities
The encountering galaxies are inuenced by each others gravita-
tional eld They strip o stars and gas from each others outer
regions and weaken or even destroy their internal stabilities and
disks This can result in a star burst andor the termination of SF
on a long timescale of 1-5 Gyr Harassment is a theoretically mo-
tivated mechanism which has been observed in numerical simu-
lations see Moore et al 1998 Richstone 1976 It is believed to
play an important role in rich galaxy clusters Gas stripping de-
scribes interactions between the gas in the disk of a galaxy and the
hot and dense Intra Cluster Medium ICM detected in X-ray ob-
servations Gunn  Gott 1972 Quilis et al 2000 Some examples
are viscous stripping thermal evaporation and ram pressure strip-
ping The eect is strongest when the relative velocities are high
and the ICM is very dense ie it is expected to take place in the cen-
tral cluster regions Ram pressure stripping has been observed see
Cayatte et al 1990 Bravo-Alfaro et al 2000 Gavazzi et al 2003
and has an indirect eect on the morphology of a galaxy as it leads
to a truncation of SF on a timescale of  01 Gyr with possibly a
small burst prior to the truncation When SF stops in a spiral galaxy
its disk starts fading considerably and the galaxy evolves towards
higher bulge to disk luminosity fractions hence towards an earlier
morphological type If instead of disk gas the low density halo gas
gets stripped from a galaxy falling into a cluster gravitational po-
tential strangulation has been proposed to occur The halo is a gas
reservoir and feeds the SF Its removal results in a termination of SF
on a timescale of  10 Gyr The morphology is again inuenced
indirectly through the halting of SF Galaxy mergers are galaxy-
galaxy interactions which are most ecient at low relative veloci-
ties Toomre  Toomre 1972 Mihos 2004 Mergers are therefore
more frequent in galaxy groups than in clusters The relative ve-
locities of galaxies in groups are comparable to the velocities of
the stars within the galaxy a condition very favorable for merging
while in clusters the galaxy velocity dispersion is higher by factors
 10 If the interacting galaxies are gas-rich a major starburst can
be triggered followed by a truncation of the star formation on a
timescale of  01 - 04 Gyr Observations about HI gas in EA
galaxies indicate galaxy-galaxy interactions or mergers as possible
transformation mechanisms Chang et al 2001 Buyle et al 2008
Enhanced merging within groups falling into clusters has been
evolved as possible explanation of the observation that the galaxy
population changes already at relatively large distances from the
cluster center around 3 Rvir see Verdugo et al 2008 where the
ICM is not yet expected to have a strong eect While starbursts in
the course of tidal stripping of galaxies are at most expected to be
weak starbursts accompanying gas-rich mergers have been found
to be very strong in some cases All of these transformation scenar-
ios result in both a morphological and a spectral transformation of
the infalling spiral-rich eld galaxy population The EA galaxies
seem to be a missing link in the process of spiral galaxies evolving
into early-type galaxies and the investigation of this galaxy type
will lead to a better understanding of galaxy evolution With sur-
veys like SDSS CNOC and LCRS EA galaxies were also found
in the eld which indicates that transformation of galaxies does not
only take place in clusters but also in enhanced density environ-
ments outside clusters Zabludo et al 1996 Balogh et al 1999
The respective timescales for the transformation scenarios need not
to be the same and are still largely unexplored The Hubble Space
Telescope HST makes it possible to also study the morphological
evolution of galaxies and compare the timescales of spectroscopic
and morphological transformation
11 EA Galaxies
The spectra of EA galaxies look like a superposition of a passive
continuum spectrum of an elliptical galaxy or an ensemble of K-
type stars without emission lines but with deep Balmer absorption
lines typical for A stars Therefore this class of galaxies was named
EA or ka which is only a spectral but not a morphological clas-
sication A lack of emission lines like in the EA galaxies indi-
cates a lack of actively star-forming regions Gomez et al 2003
Usually the equivalent width of the emission line O ii at 3727 
is measured as an indicator of current star formation On the other
hand Balmer absorption lines are an indicator for recent SF They
are produced by a dominance of intermediate age stars in the galaxy
and are strongest for A0 stars A-type stars begin to dominate the
light of a galaxy about 05 Gyr after SF stops and have a lifetime
of about 3 Gyr Their signature in the spectrum can best be seen
1-15 Gyr after active SF Leonardi  Rose 1996 Poggianti 2004
This knowledge about the origin of the Balmer absorption lines has
led to the conclusion that EA galaxies are post-starforming pas-
sive galaxies which had their last star formation about 1-15 Gyr
ago Couch  Sharples 1987 Poggianti 2004 A starburst ie a
short-term increase in the SF activity preceding the halting of SF
is required in galaxies with strong Balmer lines The strength of the
Balmer lines is a measure of the strength of the recent SF
The exact denitions of EA galaxies varies among dierent
authors Yang et al 2004 set the threshold for EA galaxies at an
EWh H H H i  55  while Poggianti et al 2004 classify
galaxies with EWH  3  as EA galaxies and propose an addi-
tional threshold of EWH  5  for strong EA galaxies For the
EWO ii a threshold around 2-5  is usually adopted depending
on the detection limit In this work we chose the H-line at 4100
 as an indicator for recent SF because this line is less aected
by emission lling than lower order lines The threshold for EA
galaxies is set to EWH  5 
12 Goal of this Work
In this work we will investigate dierent scenarios which are
thought to be responsible for the transformation from one galaxy
type to another Our focus is on EA galaxies which are believed
to be a transition stage in galaxy transformation from low density
environment spirals to high density environment S0 galaxies For
this purpose a grid of galaxy models is calculated with our galaxy
evolution code GALEV which models the photometric spectral
and chemical evolution of a galaxy With starbursts andor the halt-
ing of the star formation we can simulate the eect of the dier-
ent processes of galaxy transformation on the SFR The GALEV
code does not take into account the dynamical evolution or spatial
resolution We only consider here the eect of the various transfor-
mation scenarios on the SFR and on the evolution of the integral
spectrum and colors of a galaxy that it induces
Our goal is to identify possible progenitors and successors of

that can be drawn from our calculated grid of undisturbed and post-
starburst galaxies In Sect 4 a conclusion is given In a companion

2 MODEL DESCRIPTION
21 Undisturbed Galaxies
The GALEV code starts from a gas cloud of primordial abundance
and a given initial mass A given star formation rate SFR t de-
termines the total amount of stars formed in each time step The
mass distribution of the new stars is determined by an initial mass
function IMF  The evolution of each star in the Hertzsprung-
Russell diagram HRD is traced with a set of stellar isochrones for
5 dierent metallicities We have used the latest isochrones from
the Padova group Bertelli et al 1994 Girardi et al 2003 that con-
tain 26 stellar masses with 1067 evolutionary stages including the
thermal-pulsing AGB phase Each stage is determined by eective
temperature Te luminosity Lbol
and life time At any timestep
Lbol
the galaxy is described by a set of weighted isochrones With a li-
brary of stellar model atmosphere spectra it is possible to calculate
a spectrum for each isochrone The adopted stellar library contains
spectra from the UV to the NIR for all spectral types and luminos-
ity classes for 5 metallicities Lejeune et al 1998 Summing the
isochrone spectra for each metallicity weighted by the SFR at the
birth of the stars and adding the spectra of the various metallicity
subpopulations we synthesize an integrated galaxy spectrum For
details about the GALEV code see Anders  Fritze-v Alvensleben
2003
For undisturbed spiral galaxy models we tie the SFR t to
the evolving gas content Gt with Gt  t and determine ef-
ciency parameters for spectral galaxy types Sa Sb Sc Sd as to
obtain for a Salpeter IMF at an age of 12 Gyr agreement with ob-
servations in the UV optical and NIR The initial gas masses and
hence the initial value of the SFR are chosen as to obtain after 12
Gyr of evolution the average observed B-band luminosities of the
respective galaxy types Sa Sb Sc Sd as determined for Virgo by
Sandage et al 1985 Fig 1 shows the evolution of the SFR t
over time for the undisturbed Sa Sb Sc and Sd galaxy models
We stress that our Sa Sb Sc Sd galaxy models are meant
to describe spectral galaxy types The observed one-to-one corre-
spondence between spectral and morphological galaxy types in the
local universe might of course not hold back until arbitrary high
redshifts
The UV optical and NIR colors the spectra the gas content
and the chemical abundances are in agreement with observations as
shown in Bicker et al 2004 However in contrast to Bicker et al
2004 in this work the metallicity of the stellar population is held
constant at Z  0008 ie at about half-solar metallicity Half-solar
metallicity is a typical value for spiral galaxies in the local and
moderately distant universe Tremonti et al 2004 Zaritsky et al
1994 There are several reasons why closed-box models used in the
chemically consistent description do not appear appropriate for in-
vestigating EA galaxies 1 EA are likely to be caused by major
mergers of two gas-rich ie late-type spirals Kaviraj et al 2007 in

galaxy models
order to reproduce the large fraction of newly formed stars Those
mergers are by denition no closed-boxes so that assuming closed
box models are not justied 2 Other galaxy transformation pro-
cesses in clusters are as well expected to be accompanied by mass
loss 3 Bursts are likely to be associated with galactic outows
also making the assumptions of closed-boxes invalid Further sup-
port comes from the non-detections of many EAs in HI implying
low remaining gas-masses Goto 2004 Liu et al 2007
The GALEV code does not take into account that galaxies
might contain a high amount of dust which has a reddening ef-
fect on the integral colors However the majority of post-starburst
galaxies are believed to contain no or only little amount of dust
Balogh et al 2005 Goto 2004 and therefore can be modelled ac-
curately with GALEV Some post-starburst galaxies on the other
hand seem to still contain some dust Those galaxies of course
cannot appropriately be described by our dust-free models
Our spectra do not have enough resolution to quantitatively
analyze any lines While we implemented a calculation for the O ii
emission lines into the GALEV code for the analysis of the Balmer
lines we used the Lick calibration to calculate the line strength sep-
arately see Sect 23 and 22
22 Lick Indices
GALEV models include Lick indices which are spectral absorption
features in well-dened wavelength ranges The names of the 25
Lick indices refer to the most prominent line in the wavelength
range of each individual index Most indices are measured in terms
of equivalent widths with the following denition
EW  Z 2
FC  FI
Here FI is the ux for the index between two wavelengths 1
and 2 FC is the continuum ux calculated from two pseudo-
continua with wavelength ranges dened to the left and right of
the central index bandpass
We model the Lick indices for individual stars on the ba-
sis of polynomial tting functions of Worthey et al 1994 and
Worthey  Ottaviani 1997 The index strength for the isochrones
are derived by integrating and weighting with the IMF With the
isochrones from all contributions at each timestep we get weighted
Lick indices for the galaxy for detail see Lilly  Fritze 2006

24 Galaxy Transformation Scenarios
The interactions of galaxies as described in Sect 1 have dierent
characteristic inuences on the SFR of a galaxy Only the eects
on the SFR will be the subject of this investigation The dynam-
ical and morphological transformation which accompany galaxy
transformation processes are beyond the scope of this work
The various mechanisms are realized with GALEV by induc-
ing a sudden change in the SFR of a normal undisturbed galaxy
Three dierent ways of changing the SFR can describe the four
important mechanisms of galaxy interaction 1 A truncation of
the SFR on a short timescale 2 a termination of SF on a long
timescale and 3 a burst which is a rapid short-term increase in
SFR before a truncation or termination of the SFR Our assump-
tion of a sudden increase is compatible with the ndings from
Bekki et al 2005 who used a 2-D dynamical simulation of spiral
mergers and also found a very sharp rise in SFR at the onset of the
burst followed by an exponentially declining SFR Possible scenar-
ios for the decline in SFR after a burst are exhaustion of the fuel
for SF the heating and stirring of the ISM during the burst or the
expansion of the remaining gas by a large scale galactic wind We
chose spiral type galaxies as most likely progenitors for EA galax-
ies Bursts of SF at various times tburst with various burst strengths
b and decline timescales  are induced in the dierent spiral type
models to simulate the dierent burst and truncation scenarios Tab
2 shows how the eects of the dierent transformation processes
are described by our models in their impact on the SFR
To model a burst the SFR of an undisturbed spiral is set to a
value burst at time tburst The decline after the burst is described by
an exponential law with a decline timescale

Gyr and decline times of 01 Gyr 03 Gyr and 10 Gyr A burst
strength b0 stands for pure truncation or termination of SF de-
pending on the decline time In the following we will refer to galax-
ies with starbursts SF truncation and SF termination together as
post-starburst galaxies since one can describe a truncation or ter-
mination as starburst with a burst strength of 0

25 The SFRs of Starburst Galaxy Models
In Fig 2 the evolution of the SFR t for an Sc galaxy model with
various burst scenarios is shown in contrast to an undisturbed Sc
galaxy
Three bursts beginning at 6 Gyr with the same decline times
of 10 Gyr but dierent burst strengths of b30 50 and 70
are compared From the three burst scenarios beginning at 9 Gyr
on the right it can be seen that at a given gas consumption rate the
decline time ie the transformation scenario inuences the maxi-
mum of the SFR in the burst signicantly At xed  a burst with
higher gas consumption has a larger burst While a long decline
time typical for mild harassment or strangulation results only in a
small maximum burst SFR burst a medium or short decline time
caused by gas stripping or by a merger produces much higher burst
SFRs when consuming the same amount of gas It can also be seen
that the burst SFR signicantly depends on the onset time of the
burst A later beginning implies that the galaxy has already con-
sumed more of its gas content Therefore a burst at a galaxy age of
9 or 11 Gyr will not have as high a SFR as a burst at 6 Gyr
The scenarios in Fig 3 again compared to an undisturbed Sc
model show the truncationtermination of the SF of an Sc model at
an age of 6 Gyr on dierent timescales  The models with 01
Gyr and 03 Gyr simulate a truncation after a merger or the strip-
ping of gas from the disk The model with 10 Gyr is a termina-
tion of SF as caused by galaxy harassment or strangulation
3 RESULTS
31 Lick Index H of Undisturbed Galaxies
In this Sect we investigate the evolution of the EWH for our
undisturbed galaxy models for spectral types Sa Sb Sc to later
compare them with the transformation models In Fig 4 we plot
the EWH as a function of galaxy age The horizontal line in Fig
4 indicates the 5  threshold separating H-strong from non-H-
strong galaxy models Galaxies lying above this line during any
time of their evolution would be observationally classied as H-
strong galaxies and therefore fulll one of the two criteria for the
denition of EA galaxies

of SFR on dierent timescales of 01 03 and 10 Gyr but with the same
onset at 6 Gyr
Age Gyr
Figure 4 Time evolution of the EWH of undisturbed spiral galaxies The
horizontal line marks the 5  threshold
Fig 4 shows that the EWH grows fast after the onset of SF
and reaches a maximum value around 1 Gyr The EWH of 556
 of the dierent galaxy types declines on dierent timescales
It is to note that all undisturbed normal spiral galaxy models
lie above the threshold and therefore have an H-strong phase early
in their evolution lasting until ages of 3 to almost 6 Gyr ie to
redshifts z 21 for Sa and Sd types respectively The values for
EWO ii and for EWH for an Sa and an Sd model at 15 Gyr
are listed in Tab 4 The values for the EWO ii are too high for
the undisturbed galaxies in the H-strong phase to classify them as
EA galaxies

and 6 Gyr are a striking result because it indicates that galaxies
which only follow the normal evolution all go through a phase in
which they have strong H-lines without having a starburst Not
taking this result into account in analyses of high redshift galaxies
leads to an underestimate of their emission lines which are inu-
enced by the Balmer absorption lines for example the H and H
and of the SFR derived from those
From Fig 4 it is also obvious that a lower threshold of 3  for
EWH as sometimes used in literature is not appropriate because
the undisturbed galaxy models have values of EWH  3  for at
least 9 Gyr ie until z 04
32 Lick Index H for Post-Starburst Galaxies
For the discussion of the EA galaxies we start with the investiga-
tion of EWH and EWO ii of our starburst models because
the presence of strong Balmer absorption lines and the absence
of emission lines are the two criteria to distinguish between EA
and non-EA galaxy models In Sect 32 we investigate which of
our models are H-strong by looking at the EWH as a func-
tion of time and in Sect 34 we investigate the time evolution of
EWO ii
In Figs 5 and 6 the evolution of the EWH of dierent burst
and truncation models are represented Fig 5 shows an Sd and an
Sa model with a burst at a galaxy age of 6 Gyr as well as an Sa
model with a burst at a galaxy age of 9 Gyr and 11 Gyr For all
four models the burst strength b amounts to 70 and the decline
time is 01 Gyr For the two models with a burst at 6 Gyr the
EWH drops strongly at the onset of the burst before it grows and
crosses the threshold of 5  This drop is caused by the dominance
of young burst stars which do not show strong Balmer lines The
H-strong phase starts 02 Gyr after the onset of the burst and lasts
for 05 Gyr Sa to 11 Gyr Sd After the H-strong phase the
EWH declines very fast and becomes smaller than in the undis-
turbed galaxies In contrast to the undisturbed galaxies the decline
of the EWH is similar for the dierent galaxy models The Sd
galaxy shows the strongest H-line because an Sd galaxy at an age
of 6 Gyr has a higher gas content than the other spiral models which
consume their gas faster and hence allows for the highest burst SFR
Also at an age of 6 Gyr the underlying stellar population before the
burst has already a higher EWH than earlier spiral models
Comparing the three Sa models with the dierent onset times
of 6 Gyr 9 Gyr and 11 Gyr Fig 5 shows that the burst strength
reected in the strength of the H-lines depends strongly on the
gas content and its evolution over time For early bursts the gas
reservoir in the Sa model is still high enough to allow for high burst
SFRs and to drive the galaxy to high values of EWH after the
burst At a galaxy age of 69 Gyr the gas content of the Sa galaxies
is very small because most of the gas has already been converted
into stars Due to the small amount of gas left in the galaxies only
a small starburst can occur at these redshifts and the models do not
reach the H-strong regime any more at low redshifts This helps
us to understand why relatively few EA galaxies are observed at
low redshifts
Fig 6 compares burst and truncation scenarios and bursts with
dierent decline timescales In comparison to the burst scenar-
ios the EWH of the truncation and termination scenarios in-
creases immediately without dropping rst However the strength
of EWH is much weaker than for galaxies with a preceding burst
In fact only the very strongest cases of the truncation scenario ie
the sudden halting of the relatively high SFR in Sc and Sd models
result in EWH values slightly above 5  for 03 Gyr Sc and 05

phase of the truncation scenarios starts earlier eg 20 Myr after the
onset of SF truncation in an Sd model Fig 6 also illustrates on the
example of an Sd model that a longer decline time results 1 in
weaker Balmer lines and 2 possibly in a longer H-strong phase
if enough gas is available and therefore the burst SFR can be strong
enough for the model galaxy to reach the 5  threshold in the post-
starburst phase
The H-strong phase can last up to 2 Gyr in cases with long
burst timescales
The EWH strength does not simply depend on the burst
strength but on a complex interplay of burst strength decline
timescale onset of the burst and progenitor galaxy type Depending
on the individual model either one of these factors can dominate the
inuence on the EWH
To study the possible impact of metallicity eects on the H-
strength we run Sd type constant SFR models with dierent metal-
licities 00004 6 Z 6 005 The scenarios in Fig 7 show three

values and is therefore easier to measure than the other Balmer

line is less aected by any potential emission line contributions in
case of low level residual SF in the galaxy

is obvious from Fig 7 that
the EWH depends on
the metallicity of the galaxy While the peak values achieved
for EWH are somewhat higher for high metallicity galaxies
EWH  9  for Z005 versus EWH  8  for Z00004 a
low metallicity galaxy remains much longer in the H-strong phase
At low metallicities the stars are generally hotter and brighter
Therefore stars of lower mass populate regions in the HRD that are
described by A and early F spectra For example at solar metallic-
ity the 14 M star is the lowest mass reaching into the early F-star
range At low metallicity longer-living stars down to 09 M reach
this range and live there for about 4 Gyr Stars with 09 M are
much more numerous than 14 M stars as a consequence of the
stellar IMF The A-star temperature range in the HRD is reached
at solar metallicities by stars  16 M which live there for  15
Gyr At low metallicities Z002 these temperatures are already
reached by stars  1 M which live there for  38 Gyr The life
time of an A star increases therefore by a factor  2 at lower metal-
licities while additionally there is a higher number of A stars both
acting together to cause a longer H-strong phase These two ef-
fects apparently strongly overcompensate the fact that the lifetime
of 153 M stars is longer at higher metallicities The lifetime of
stars in this mass range at a metallicity of Z005 is only a factor 
2 higher than their lifetime at Z00004 and these high mass stars
are much less numerous
Because galaxies in the early Universe tend to have lower
metallicities than galaxies in the local Universe and since a lower
metallicity implies a longer H-strong phase the probability to ob-
serve a galaxy in its EA phase increases towards higher redshifts
Therefore a higher number of EA galaxies cannot be ascribed
solely to a higher number of starburst galaxies but also to the lower
metallicities and therefore a longer H-strong phase of galaxies in
the early Universe Higher maximal burst strengths enabled by the
higher gas content add to this eect
In the GALEV code two dierent Lick indices for H are im-
plemented HA and HF The index HA which is mainly used in
this work has a wider index bandpass and wider pseudo-continuum
ranges Lilly  Fritze 2006 The values of EWHF are signi-
cantly lower at all times than the values of EWHA Therefore it
is very important to check for the consistency of the EWH de-
nitions before comparing with observations of all the Balmer lines
33 H-Strong Galaxies
In this Sect we will explore those scenarios from our grid which
become H-strong and identify the progenitors of the H-strong
galaxies
As shown in Sect 31 all burst scenarios with a burst at 3
Gyr are H-strong since already the undisturbed galaxy models lie
above the 5  threshold at this time of their evolution see Fig
4 For a certain type of progenitor spiral galaxy the essential
parameter to cause an EWH above 5  is the peak burst SFR
burst and not the burst strength For dierent spiral progenitors
dierent peak burst SFRs are required in order to make them H-
strong after the burst For example all Sa galaxies with a burst SFR
burst  15
yr become H-strong while for Sa models with a burst
SFR below this value the EWH does not reach the 5  threshold
There are a few exceptions of galaxies which have a value for burst
above the threshold value for the corresponding galaxy type but do
not become H-strong These exceptions are due to the EWH of
the underlying undisturbed galaxy models Bursts at a later stage in
the life of the galaxy cannot cause as strong an H-line not even for
higher SFRs than bursts at earlier times because the EWH of the
underlying undisturbed model is already low The later the bursts
start the lower are the peak values for the EWH The EWH of
the underlying galaxy is also responsible for the fact that the dif-
ferent galaxy types have to be examined separately and no global
minimal value can be given for a burst SFR to cause an H-strong
Without exception all Sd models with a burst become H-
strong The maximum value for EWH of 85  in our sample
is reached by the Sd model with a burst of strength b70 at 6 Gyr
and a decline time 01 Gyr Almost all Sc burst models become
H-strong Only Sc burst models with long decline time which have
moderate to low burst strength and the burst at late galaxy ages do
not reach the threshold Sb burst models with a long decline time
do not become H-strong while all Sb models with a short decline
time have a H-strong phase For Sb burst models with a moderate
decline time of 03 Gyr it delicately depends on the beginning and
the strength of the burst Most Sa burst models do not become H-
strong Only very few models with early bursts which have short
decline times have a H-strong phase
For the models with SF truncation and termination without a
preceding burst only Sc and Sd galaxies can possibly become H-
strong No Sa or Sb truncation or termination model at any galaxy
age or with any decline time reaches EWH 5  Sc trunca-
tion and termination models without a preceding burst only be-
come H-strong when SF is truncated at early ages and on short
timescales ie harassment and strangulation scenarios without a
burst can be excluded as possible progenitors for EA galaxies
In contrast the Sd models with short and moderate decline times
become H-strong Even an Sd model with a SF termination on a
long timescale at early ages has an H-strong phase Tab 5 shows
a compilation of the H-strong models with starbursts at 9 Gyr
It can be seen that the later the progenitor galaxy type the
more models become H-strong

The second important criterion for a galaxy to be classied as EA
galaxy is to ensure that the galaxy has no current SF by measur-
ing the EWO ii at 3727  For this purpose we modelled the
EWO ii on the basis of the SFR and B-band luminosity using a
relation given by Kennicutt 1992b as introduced in Sect 23 In
Fig 8 the time evolution of the EWO ii of an Sd galaxy with a
burst of 70 an onset at 6 Gyr and a decline time of 01 Gyr and
of an Sc galaxy with a burst of 70 an onset at 11 Gyr and a de-
cline time of 03 Gyr is shown The EWO ii increases instantly
at the onset of the burst and afterwards decreases rapidly
It is obvious that the EWO ii reects the time evolution
of the SFR It is to note however that the EWO ii remains at
high values for some time after the burst and therefore extends into
parts of the H-strong phase as can be seen in Fig 9 for the Sd
and Sc galaxy models described above In this Fig the time evo-
lution of EWO ii is plotted together with the time evolution of
EWH The peaks of the EWO ii are not shown in this gure
because the values are much higher than EWH during the burst
and would make it impossible to see the EWH in the same plot
The horizontal line marks the thresholds for EWH as well as for
EWO ii The threshold for EWO ii is chosen to be 5  ie

at the upper limit for this threshold from Dressler et al 1999 We
chose this upper limit taking into account that observed spectra al-
ways have noise which tends to bias observed EWO ii towards
lower values while we calculated the EWO ii from the SFR
The Sd galaxy in Fig 9 is the model with the longest EA
phase of 071 Gyr in our grid It is the same galaxy that has the
strongest peak value for EWH in our sample The beginning of
the EA phase is given by the drop of EWO ii below 5  while
the end of the EA phase is dened by the drop of EWH be-
low 5  The duration of the EA phase thus amounts only 64
of the H-strong phase with a duration of 111 Gyr This example
shows that the EA phase only accounts a dramatically short frac-
tion of the post-starburst phase For many galaxy models the phase
of strong O ii emission is even longer than the H-strong phase as
demonstrated in the left of Fig 9 The H-strong phase of the Sc
galaxy model is already over when the EWO ii drops below 5 
and this model therefore would not be classied as an EA galaxy
It is striking that the models can clearly be separated accord-
ing to the dierent decline times from looking at the strength of
EWO ii All H-strong galaxy models with SFR decline times of
01 Gyr have an EA phase ie sucient low O ii-lines during
their H-strong phase while all models with SFR decline times of
10 Gyr and 03 Gyr never go through an EA phase since they still
have O ii emission during their H-strong phase
Therefore we state that the conventional denition of EA
galaxies based on the absence of O ii emission above some thresh-
old is too narrow to encompass the full range of post-starburst
galaxies In particular galaxies with a long decline time are ex-
cluded since they exhibit signicant O ii emission in addition to
their strong Balmer absorption lines Possible processes leading to
EA galaxies can only be galaxy mergers and gas stripping with a
starburst while harassment and strangulation can be excluded due
to their long decline timescales

est and the lowest peak value for EWH The highest value is
reached by the Sd model with a burst strength b70 an onset at

all graphs of Figs 10 to 13 The dierent stages of the galaxies in
these gures are given in relation to the onset of the burst The two
graphs in Fig 10 show the spectra of the Sd and Sa burst models
at an age of 5 Gyr ie 1 Gyr before the burst starts Therefore the
galaxies have spectra of normal undisturbed Hubble type Sd and
Sa galaxies at that age The graphs in Fig 11 show the same galax-
ies during their bursts at an age of 6 Gyr The spectra show much
stronger emission lines and a higher UV ux than the undisturbed
galaxies
In Fig 12 the H-strong phase of the two models is shown
The spectra show the galaxies at the age when the EWH has
reached its maximum value ie at 66 Gyr for the Sd and at 64
Gyr for the Sa model and at an age of 7 Gyr ie 1 Gyr after the
burst In Tab 6 the corresponding line strengths for EWH and
EWO ii are listed for these spectra We recall that our spectra
do not have enough resolution to measure the line strength The
values for the line strengths of EWH and EWO ii listed here
are calculated as described in Sect 23 and 22
The spectra at 66 Gyr and 64 Gyr respectively still have
high UV uxes and the overall continuum does not yet look like
a typical passive galaxy spectrum but instead resembles an A-star
spectrum In comparison the two spectra look rather dierent es-
pecially when looking at the regions around the Lyman--line at
1216  and the 4000  break The Balmer lines are stronger in the

Sd galaxy and no signicant emission lines can be seen In fact the
Sd galaxy at 66 Gyr has an EWO ii lower than 5  and would
be classied as an EA galaxy However its spectrum at the bot-
tom of Fig 12 does not look like a typical EA spectrum ie like
a spectrum of a passive galaxy with signicant A-star features par-
ticularly when looking at the UV ux This confusion is due to the
fact that in the literature spectra of EA galaxies do not reach into
the UV region which however is the wavelength range with the
strongest changes during the post-starburst phase
The Sa model has strong O ii emission lines for a longer time
after the burst while its values for EWH are weaker and drop

faster than in the Sd model In contrast to the Sd model the Sa
galaxy at 64 Gyr still has an EWO ii 5  as shown in Tab 6
Its spectrum 1 Gyr after the burst looks like a typical passive spec-
trum with a superposition of A-star features The UV ux is very
low and the Lyman--line at 1216  has disappeared No emission
lines can be seen while the Balmer lines and the 4000  break are
present even though EWH 6 5  for the Sa galaxy model see
Tab 6 From the continuum ratios as well as from the strengths of
the Balmer lines and the 4000  break the dierent burst scenarios
are distinguishable
The spectra in Fig 13 show the galaxy models after the EA
phase at a galaxy age of 9 Gyr Now 3 Gyr after the burst both
spectra look like true passive galaxy spectra and the Balmer lines
have disappeared We conclude that studying EA galaxies over
a larger wavelength range particularly including the UV range
promises a better discrimination of progenitor galaxies and trans-
formation scenarios than only looking at EWH and EWO ii
Our results also indicate that the analysis of Spectral Energy Distri-
butions SEDs extending from UVU trough optical and eventually
NIR passbands will allow to encompass all post-starburst phases
even those which are excluded from the classical EA denition
based on the optical region only This will be investigated Paper II
36 Comparison with Template Spectra
In Figs 14 to 16 dierent ages of the Sa galaxy model with a burst
onset at 6 Gyr a burst strength of 50 and a decline time of 01 Gyr
are shown together with the EA galaxy template from Kennicutt
1992a Fig 14 shows the Sa model 04 Gyr after the burst At this
age the model spectrum is still too young to match the template
The ux between 4000 and 5000  still is too high When we look
at Fig 15 we can see that 07 Gyr after the burst the ux decreased
enough to match the template very well A little later 1 Gyr after
the burst the ux between 4000 and 5000  is already too low
as compared to the template continuum Fig 17 shows the same
Sa galaxy model 7 Gyr after the burst compared to Kennicuts E
galaxy template The model has passed the EA phase and matches
the template of an E galaxy very well
In Figs 18 and 19 we compare the Sd model with a burst of
70 an onset at 6 Gyr and a decline time of 01 Gyr with Kenni-
cuts EA and E templates respectively Shown are the Sd model
spectra at the times when they best match
It is obvious that in general the model spectra match the tem-
plates very well however not quite as well as the Sa model spectra
This result is inline with investigations of NGC 3 921 in the liter-
ature It is proposed that NGC 3921 is a merger remnant of two
disk galaxies Sa and Sc with a burst 0703 Gyr ago which is
expected to evolve into a normal elliptical galaxy on a timescale of

In Fig 20 three Sd models with the same onset of the burst at 6
Gyr the same decline timescale of 01 Gyr but dierent burst
strength 70 30 and 0 ie SF truncation are presented as
well as an Sd model with an onset at 6 Gyr and a decline timescale
of 10 Gyr with a burst strength of 70 For comparison an
undisturbed Sd model is shown We recall that the scenario with
the long decline timescale does not lead to an EA phase because
it shows signicant O ii-lines during its H-strong phase A burst
causes the galaxies to become very blue before they get red due to
the truncationtermination of SF The models with SF truncation or
termination only quickly become red immediately after the onset
Therefore up to 12 Gyr the models with a starbust before the halt-
ing of SF are bluer Late type spiral galaxies are in general bluer
than early type galaxies and therefore take longer to become red
For old ages all burst and SF truncationtermination scenarios con-
verge to similar colors as the age dierences between their stellar
populations become more and more negligible and the photometry
of the galaxies is dominated by stars of the Red Giant Branch and
Asymptotic Giant Branch
The decline timescale of the burst has a strong eect on how
fast the galaxy model becomes red after the burst The model with a
long decline time of 10 Gyr is bluer than the undisturbed model for
almost 2 Gyr while the model with the shortest decline timescale
of 01 Gyr is already redder than the undisturbed model after about
05 Gyr The symbols mark 1 Gyr intervals In Fig 21 the EWH
is plotted against the color BR With this plot it is possible to
investigate the evolution in color during the H-strong phase It is
possible to see which galaxy models become red during their H-
strong phase and which remain blue Since blue as well as red EA
galaxies have been observed this investigation is of great interest
Yang et al 2008 Zabludo et al 1996 The horizontal line is the
5  threshold separating H-strong from non H-strong models
while the vertical line at BR11 separates blue to the left from
red galaxies on the right
The value of 11 for the limit was chosen to lie between the
values of the undisturbed Sb and Sc models at a galaxy age of 13
Gyr ie at redshift z0 Model in the upper right square are red
during their H-strong phase The arrow points into the direction in
which the models evolve with time
In Fig 21 two Sd models with the same burst strength of 70
and an onset at 6 Gyr but dierent decline times  01 and 10 Gyr
are shown together with the undisturbed Sd model Again it has to
be remarked that the model with the long decline time is not an
EA galaxy The burst models separate from the undisturbed model
after the 6 Gyr mark due to the rapid change in color at the onset of
the burst At the beginning of the burst the color starts to change
faster than the EWH The model with the decline time of 10
Gyr falls already under the 5  threshold before it reaches the red
side ie it spends all of its H-strong phase in the blue The model
with a shorter decline time of 01 Gyr crosses the blue-red border
while still H-strong It is observable both in a blue and in a red
H-strong phase because the value for EWH of the model with
decline time 01 Gyr reaches a high peak value for EWH and
drops slowlier below 5  than the color evolves towards the red
The two models in Fig 21 are representative for all models of our
grid Hence all EA galaxy models with short decline times become
red while models with long decline times not EA always stay
blue and do not cross the color threshold
For models with a decline time of 03 Gyr it depends on the
time when the burst occurs wether they get red during their H-
strong phase or not All models with a decline time of 03 Gyr and
an onset at 11 Gyr become red during their H-strong phase while
models with a decline time of 03 Gyr and an onset at 9 and 6
Gyr can show either behavior Some of these models have stronger
values for EWH and become red during their H-strong phase
while others have EWH only marginally above the 5  threshold
and do not stay H-strong long enough to have a red H-strong
We conclude that the later the type and the longer the decline
time the longer it takes for the models to become red Red post-
starburst galaxies are possibly a later stage of blue post-starburst
galaxies with a strong burst ie a merger or gas stripping sce-
nario in a late stage Scenarios that terminate the SFR on a long
timescale like those associated with harassment and strangulation
or scenarios with an intermediate decline time with a weak burst
can be excluded for red H-strong galaxies
By looking at the colors of H-strong galaxies we can con-
strain their decline times This result let us assume that these sce-

4 CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK
We investigated the transformation of galaxies when entering a
high density environment like a galaxy cluster In particular we
focused on the EA galaxy class which contains galaxies in an
important transition stage a post-starburst phase of galaxy trans-
formation EA galaxies are dened to have strong Balmer absorp-
tion lines but no signicant emission lines The spectrum of an EA
galaxy therefore looks like a superposition of the passive spectrum
of an elliptical galaxy and deep Balmer absorption lines typical for
A-stars We examined the dierent processes of galaxy transfor-
mation like mergers harassment gas stripping and strangulation in
terms of their impact on the SF history of galaxies and identied
the most likely progenitors and successors of EA galaxies For
this purpose we used the GALEV galaxy evolution code to calcu-
late a grid of spiral galaxy models with dierent combinations of
a starburst ie a sudden increase of the star formation rate SFR
and a halting of the SFR on dierent timescales ie SF truncation
and termination With these scenarios it is possible to describe the
eects on the SFR of the four dierent galaxy transformation sce-
narios mentioned above We varied the amount of gas consumed in
the starburst burst strength and the galaxy age at which the star-
burst the SF truncation or termination begins onset The spectra
and colors as well as the time evolution of Lick indices in particular
the EWH of the H absorption line at 4100  and the EWO ii
of the O ii emission line at 3727  as indicators of recent and
ongoing SF were modelled and discussed
When investigating the time evolution of the EWH we
found that the EWH is the result of a complex interplay of burst
strength decline timescale onset of the burst and progenitor galaxy
i The later the progenitor galaxy type the easier an H-strong
phase is reached All Sd burst models become H-strong and the
maximum value for EWH is reached by an Sd model For a
certain type of progenitor spiral galaxy the essential parameter to
cause an EWH above 5  is the peak burst SFR burst with dif-
ferent values for each spiral type
ii The earlier the onset of the burst the higher are the peak
values reached by the EWH For bursts beginning at a galaxy
age of 3 Gyr all scenarios are H-strong due to the larger available
gas reservoir at such young ages
iii The longer the decline timescale of the SFR after a burst
the lower are the values reached for EWH but the longer is the
duration of the H-strong phase The H- strong phase can last up
to 2 Gyr in cases of long decline timescales
iv The higher the burst strength the higher are the peak values
for the EWH Only very few scenarios with a truncation or ter-
mination of SF without a preceding burst have a H-strong phase
Those are the late-type spirals with their relatively high SFRs and a
truncation on a short timescale They have EWH slightly above
5  for a short time
We nd a signicant eect of the metallicities in galaxies on
their EWH and conclude that a higher number of EA galax-
ies at high redshift cannot be ascribed solely to a higher number
of starburst galaxies but also to the lower metallicities of galaxies
that cause longer H-strong phases in the early universe and to the
higher burst strengths enabled by the higher gas content
A striking result are the values for EWH that we found for
undisturbed galaxies We discovered that galaxies which only fol-
low the normal evolution all go through a phase between ages of
15 and 6 Gyr in which they have strong H-lines Not taking this
result into account in analyses of high redshift galaxies leads to
an underestimation of emission lines which are inuenced by the
Balmer absorption lines for example the H-line and H and of
the SFR derived from those
By investigating the second criterion for EA galaxies the
O ii emission line at 3727  we found that the selection crite-
ria for EA galaxies commonly used exclude a signicant number
of post-starburst galaxies in particular those galaxies with a long
decline time The conventional denition of an EA galaxy is too
narrow to encompass the full range of post-starburst galaxies Pos-
sible progenitors of EA galaxies can only be galaxy mergers and
maybe galaxies with gas stripping with a starburst while the pro-
cesses of harassment and strangulation can be excluded due to the
long decline timescales they induce for SF
The comparison of EA galaxy spectra several Gyr after the
starburst with template spectra of E and S0 galaxies showed that
the successors of EA galaxies are early-type galaxies From our
model spectra of EA galaxies we predict that studying EA
galaxies over a larger wavelength range particularly including the
UV yields a better discrimination of progenitor galaxies and trans-
formation scenarios The analysis of Spectral Energy Distributions
SEDs will allow to encompass all post-starburst phases even
those which are excluded from the classical EA denition based
on optical regions only From our investigation of the time evo-
lution of the BR colors of our post-starburst galaxy models we
found that the progenitor galaxy type and the decline time have
the greatest eects on the color evolution The later the type and
the longer the decline time the longer it takes for the models to
become red Red EA galaxies and red post-starburst galaxies in
general are possibly a later stage of blue post-starburst galaxies
with a strong burst and a short or intermediate decline time as eg
triggered by a merger Galaxy models with an intermediate decline
time 03 Gyr with a weak burst and models with a long decline
time 10 Gyr no matter how strong a burst was do not become
red during their H-strong phase Our results from examining the
spectra and the colors of post-starburst galaxies indicate that it is
possible to select and distinguish post-starburst galaxies by look-
ing at their Spectral Energy Distributions SEDs which will be
presented in Paper II
We have shown that EA galaxies by denition include only
transformation processes on a short timescale The full range of
post-starburst galaxies have not yet been investigated observation-
ally This needs to be done in order to achieve a comprehensive
understanding of the galaxy transformation processes in high den-
sity environments
