In this series of lectures I discuss the basic principles and the modelling of the chemical evolu-
tion of galaxies In particular I present models for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way
galaxy and compare them with the available observational data From this comparison one can
infer important constraints on the mechanism of formation of the Milky Way as well as on stel-
lar nucleosynthesis and supernova progenitors Models for the chemical evolution of elliptical
galaxies are also shown in the framework of the two competing scenarios for galaxy formation
monolithic and hierachical The evolution of dwarf starbursting galaxies is also presented and
the connection of these objects with Damped Lyman-  systems is briey discussed The roles
of supernovae of dierent type I II is discussed in the general framework of galactic evolu-
tion and in connection with the interpretation of high redshift objects Finally the chemical
enrichment of the intracluster medium as due mainly to ellipticals and S0 galaxies is discussed
1 Basic parameters of chemical evolution
Galactic chemical evolution is the study of the evolution in time and space of the
abundances of the chemical elements in the interstellar gas in galaxies This process is
inuenced by many parameters such as the initial conditions the star formation and
evolution the nucleosynthesis and possible gas ows
Here I describe each one separately
 Initial conditions- One can assume that all the initial gas out of which the galaxy
will form is already present when the star formation process starts or that the gas is
slowly accumulated in time Then one can assume that the initial chemical composition
of this gas is primordial no metals or that some pre- enrichment has already taken
place eg Population III stars As we will see in the following dierent assumptions
are required for dierent galaxies
 The birthrate function- Stars form and die continuously in galaxies therefore a
recipe for star formation is necessary We dene the stellar birthrate function as the
number of stars formed in the time interval dt and in the mass range dm as
Bm t  tmdtdm
t  SF R
is the star formation rate SFR and
m  IM F
is the initial mass function IMF The SFR is assumed to be only a function of time and
the IMF only a function of mass This is clearly an oversemplication but is necessary
in absence of a clear knowledge of the star formation process
 Stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis- Nuclear burnings take place in the stellar
interiors during the star lifetime and produce new chemical elements in particular metals
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
These metals together with the pristine stellar material is restored into the interstellar
medium ISM at the star death This process clearly aects crucially the chemical
evolution of the ISM In order to take into account the elemental production by stars we
dene the yields in particular the stellar yields the amount of elements produced by
a single star and the yields per stellar generation the amount of elements produced by
an entire stellar generation
 Supplementary Parameters- Infall of extragalactic gas radial ows and galactic
winds are important ingredients in building galactic chemical evolution models
2 The stellar birthrate
21 Theoretical recipes for the SFR
Several parametrizations besides the simple one of a constant t are used in the
literature for the SFR
 Exponentially decreasing
SF R  et
with   5  15 Gyr in order to produce realistic values which can be compared with
the present time SFR in the Milky Way Tosi 1988
 The Schmidt 1965 law
SF R  k
is the most widely adopted formulation for the SFR It was originally formulated by
Schmidt 19591963 as a function of the volume gas density with k  20 He measured
the space density of stars in dierent regions of the Galaxy in relation to the number
density of neutral hydrogen measured by means of the 21 cm emission The formulation
as a function of the surface gas density gas is normally preferred for studying the Milky
Way disk and galactic disks in general In principle Schmidts formulation as a function
of the volume gas density and that with gas are equivalent when k  1 Kennicutt
in a series of papers 198319891998ab tried to assess the dependence of massive star
formation on the surface gas density in disk galaxies by comparing H emission with the
data on the distribution of HI and CO and found that the SFR can be well represented
by a Schmidt law with k  14  015 The quantity  is the eciency of star formation
and is expressed in units of time1
 A more complex formulation which depends also upon the total surface mass density
was suggested by Dopita and Ryder 1994 and can be written as
SF R  k1
totk2
with tot being the total surface mass density This kind of SFR is related to the feedback
mechanism between the energy injected into the ISM by supernovae SNe and stellar
winds and the local potential well
 In alternative to the Schmidt law Kennicutt proposed also the following star for-
mation law which ts equally well the observational data
SF R  0017gasgas  R1gas
with gas being the angular rotation speed of the gas
22 The tracers of star formation
The main tracers of star formation in galaxies are
 Counts of luminous supergiants in nearby galaxies under the assumption that their
number is proportional to the SFR
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 3
 The H and H ux from HII regions which are ionized by young and hot stars
under the assumption that such ux is proportional to the SFR Kennicutt 1998
SF RMyr1  79  1042LHergs1
 From the integrated UBV colors and spectra of galaxies one can estimate the relative
proportions of young and old stars and derive the ratio between the present time SFR
and the average SFR in the past
 The frequency of type II SNe as well as the distribution of SN remnants and pulsars
can be used as tracers of the SFR These tracers have been used for deriving the SFR in
the Galactic disk
 The radio emission from HII regions can also be a tracer of the SFR
 The ultraviolet continuum and the infrared continuum star forming regions are
surrounded by dust are also connected to the SFR as in the following expression
SF RMyr1  09  106 LU V 
Lbol
derived by means of a two-slope IMF by Donas et al 1987
 Finally the SFR can be derived from the distribution of molecular clouds Rana
All of these formulations for the SFR need the assumption of an IMF and viceversa
the derivation of the IMF needs the assumption of a star formation history as described
in the next section The local SFR derived under the assumption of a particular IMF
suitable for the solar neighbourhood gives the following range of values
SF R  2  10Mpc2Gyr1
see Timmes et al 1995
23 The IMF Various Parametrizations
The IMF is a probability distribution function and is normally approximated by a power
law namely
m  am1x
which is the number of stars with masses in the interval m mdm The IMF can be
one-slope Salpeter 1955 x135 or multi-slope Scalo 19861998 Kroupa et al 1993
The IMF is usually normalized as
mmdm  1
The IMF is derived locally from the present day mass function PDMF which in turn is
obtained by counting the Main Sequence stars per interval of magnitude Then the star
counts are transformed into number of stars per pc2 and then a mass-luminosity relation
is adopted to pass from the luminosity to the mass
24 Derivation of the IMF
As already mentioned the IMF is derived by the observed PDMF which is the current
mass distribution of Main-Sequence MS stars per unit area nm
For stars 01  mm  1 with lifetimes m  tG with tG being the Galactic age
nm can be written as
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
nm  Z tG
mtdt
where tG is the Galactic lifetime These stars are all still on the MS If m is constant
in time as it is usually assumed then
nm  m    tG
where    is the average SFR in the past
For stars with m  tG m  2M we see on the MS only those born after the time
t  tG  m The PDMF is therefore
nm  Z tG
tGm
mtdt
Again if m is constant in time
nm  mtGm
under the assumption that tG  tG  m where tG is the SFR at the present
time tG and m is the lifetime of a star of mass m
The IMF m in the mass interval 1  2 M depends on the ratio
btG 
It has been shown by Scalo 1986 that a good t between the two portions of the m
namely below 1M and above 2M requires
which means that the SFR in the local disk should have varied in time less than a factor
of 2 during the whole disk lifetime

25 The Infall Rate Various Parametrizations
The presence of infall of extragalactic gas in the chemical evolution of galaxies is de-
manded by the G-dwarf metallicity distribution in the solar vicinity and by the existence
of high velocity clouds infalling towards the galactic disk The origin of this infalling gas
on the Galaxy is not yet entirely clear and measurements of the metallicity of such gas
are necessary to decide whether it originates in the galactic disk galactic fountain or if
it has an extragalactic origin
Several parametrizations for the infall rate have been used so far
 Constant in space and time
 Variable in space and time such as
IR  ARet R
with  R is constant or varying along the disk and AR is derived by tting the present
time distribution of totR tG
3 Nucleosynthesis
During the Big Bang the light elements D 3He 4He and 7Li were produced On
the other hand all the elements heavier than 7Li with the exception of Be and B are
produced inside stars The light elements 6Li Be and B are instead manufactured by
spallation processes in the ISM due to the interaction between cosmic rays and interstellar
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 5
31 Nucleosynthesis in the Big Bang
I give here a brief summary of the main steps in the Big Bang nucleosynthesis
When the temperature in the universe was T  1012K only weak interactions causing
conversions between protons and neutrons occurred namely
p  e  n  
The nucleosynthesis started when T  109K and lasted until T  108K The rst
element to be formed was D a nucleus composed by a neutron plus a proton and
subsequently 3He from the reaction
p    n  e
followed by
D  p 3 He  
Then also very small fractions of 7Li 109 by mass and 7Be 1011 by mass were
produced
3He  n 4 He  
One of the major achievements in cosmology is that it can account simultaneously
for the primordial abundances of H D 3He 4He and 7Li but only for a low density
universe The comparison between the observed primordial abundances and the Big
Bang nucleosynthesis calculations can allow to impose constraints upon the baryon to
photon ratio  in the universe In particular for a baryon to photon ratio   3  1010
the baryonic density parameter of the universe is Peacock 1999

32 Stellar Nucleosynthesis
Before discussing stellar nucleosynthesis we need to dene the crucial stellar mass ranges
 Brown Dwarfs M  ML ML  008  009M They never ignite H and their
lifetimes are larger than the age of the universe
 Low mass stars 05  MM  MHeF  MHeF 185-22M depending on stellar
models ignite He explosively and become C-O white dwarfs WD If M  05M they
become He WD The lifetimes range from several 109 years up to several Hubble times
 Intermediate mass stars MHeF  MM  Mup ignite He quiescently Mup is
the limiting mass for the formation of a C-O degenerate core and is in the range 5-9M
depending on stellar evolution models Their lifetimes range from several 107 to 109
years These stars die as C-O WDs if they are not in binary systems
If in binary
systems stars in this mass range can give rise to Type Ia SNe see later
 Massive stars M  Mup
Stars in the mass range Mup  MM  10  12 become e-capture SNe Type II SNe
and leave neutron stars as remnants Stars in the range 10  12  MM  MW R
MW R  20  40M end their lives as core-collapse SNe Type II and leave a neutron
star or a black hole as a remnant Stars in the range MW R  MM  100 probably
become Type Ib SNe The lifetimes of these stars are in the range from several 107 to
 106 years
 Very Massive Stars M  100M if they exist explode by means of pair creation
In fact at T  2  109 K a large portion of the
and are called pair-creation SNe
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
gravitational energy goes into creation of pairs e e thus the star becomes unstable
and explodes These SNe leave no remnant and have lifetimes  106 years
 Supermassive objects 400  MM  75  105 if they exist either explode due to
explosive H-burning or collapse directly to black holes The only available nucleosynthesis
calculations for these stars are from Woosley et al 1984
All the elements with mass number A from 12 to 60 have been formed in stars during
the quiescent burnings occurring during their lifetime The main nuclear burnings are
H He C Ne O and Si Stars transform H into He and then He into heaviers until
the Fe-peak elements where the binding energy per nucleon reaches a maximum At
this point nuclear fusion reactions cannot occur anymore and the Fe nucleus starts con-
tracting When the central density reaches the atomic nuclear density matter becomes
uncompressible and a core-bounce occurs with the consequent formation of a shock wave
and ejection of the star mantle However a problem exists for the explosion of stars with
large Fe cores since most of the collapse gravitational energy is used to photodisintegrate
Fe thus weakening the shock wave and preventing the mantle ejection To overcome
this problem it has been suggested the existence of some mechanisms able to rejuvenate
the shock wave such as neutrino-heating from the collapsing neutron star rotation and
magnetic elds
Here is a summary of the main nucleosynthesis stages the rst element to be burned is
H which is transformed into He through the proton-proton chain or the CNO-cycle then
4He is transformed into 12C through the triple  reaction Elements heavier than 12C are
then produced by synthesis of -particles thus producing the so-called -elements O Ne
Mg Si S Ca and Ti The last main burning in stars is the 28Si -burning which produces
56N i which then -decays into 56Co and 56F e Si-burning can be quiescent or explosive
depending on the temperature but it always produces Fe Explosive nucleosynthesis
occurs in the inverse order Si O Ne C He H relative to quiescent nucleosynthesis
depending on the fact that it starts in the center and propagates outwards following
the passage of the shock wave The main products of explosive nucleosynthesis are the
Fe-peak elements It is worth noting that low and intermediate mass stars never ignite
C and thus end their lives as C-O white dwarfs Stars with masses below 10 12 M
depending on stellar models explode during O-burning and end up as e-capture SNe
Only massive stars can ignite all six nuclear fuels until they form an Fe-core S- and
r-process elements elements with A 60 up to Th and U are formed by means of slow
or rapid relative to the - decay neutron capture by Fe seed nuclei In particular s-
processing occurs during quiescent He-burning both in massive and low and intermediate
mass stars whereas r-processing occurs during SN explosions
33 Supernova Progenitors
Supernovae planetary nebulae PNe and to a minor extent stellar winds are the means
to restore the nuclearly enriched material into the ISM thus giving rise to the process of
chemical evolution There are two main Types of SNe II I then divided in subclasses
SNe IIL IIP and SNe Ia Ib Ic As already mentioned before SNe II which are believed
to be the end state of stars more massive than 10M exploding after a Fe core is formed
core-collapse SNe produce mainly -elements O Ne Mg Si S Ca plus some Fe
The amount of Fe produced by type II SNe is one of the most uncertain quantities since
it depends upon the so-called mass cut how much Fe remains in the collapsing core and
how much is ejected and on explosive nucleosynthesis
Type Ia SNe are believed to originate from the C-deagration of a WD reaching the
Chandrasekhar mass 144 M after accretion of material from a young companion in
a close binary system C-deagration occurs as a consequence of such accretion and
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 7
an explosion ensues destroying the whole star No remnant is then left behind They
produce a large amount  06  07M of 56N i Fe plus traces of C to Si elements
C-deagration is the explosive burning which best reproduces the observed abundance
pattern in Type Ia SN remnants The best model for this kind of explosion is model W7
by Nomoto Thielemann  Yokoi 1984 The amount of Fe produced by the other Type
I SNe is smaller than that produced by the Type Ia ones at least a factor of two or more
Therefore Type Ia SNe should be considered as the responsible for the Fe enrichment in
the universe
34 Element production
Here is a summary of element production
 Big Bang  light elements H D 3He 4He 7Li Deuterium is only destroyed inside
stars to form 3He 3He is also mainly destroyed The only stars producing some 3He
are those with masses  25M Recent prescriptions for the yields of 3He are from
Forestini  Charbonnel 1997 and Sackmann  Boothroyd 1999 Lithium 7Li is
produced during the Big Bang but also in stars massive AGB stars SNe II carbon-
stars and novae Some 7Li should also be produced in spallation processes by galactic
cosmic rays see Romano et al 2001

35 Stellar yields
In order to include the results from nucleosynthesis into chemical evolution models we
need to dene the stellar yields The stellar yield of an element i is dened as the mass
fraction of a star of mass m which has been newly created as species i and ejected
pim  
In order to compute pim we need to know some fundamental quantities from stellar
evolution and nucleosynthesis
 M is the mass of the He-core where H is turned into He
 MCO is the mass of the C-O core where the He is turned into heaviers
 Mrem is the mass of the remnant WD neutron star black hole
These masses are related to each other by the following relations
M  MHe  MCO
where MHe is the newly formed and ejected 4He and
MCO  Mr  MC  MO  Mheaviers
The values of these dierent quantities are given by stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis
calculations

4 Modelling chemical evolution
41 Analytical models
The simplest model of chemical evolution is the Simple Model for the chemical evolution
of the solar neighbourhood The basic assumptions of the Simple Model are
- the system is one-zone and closed namely there are no inows or outows
- the initial gas is primordial no metals
- m is constant in time
- the gas is well mixed at any time
In the following we will adopt the formalism of Tinsley 1980 and dene
as the fractional mass of gas with
Mtot  M  Mgas
where M is the mass in stars dead and alive Possible non-baryonic dark matter is
not considered
The mass of stars can be expressed as
The abundance by mass of an element i is dened by
M  1  Mtot
where Mi is the mass in the form of the specic element i It is well known that the
abundances must satisfy the condition Pi Xit  1 where the summation is over all
the chemical elements
The initial conditions are
Mgas0  Mtot
 Xi0  0
where i refers to metals The equation for the evolution of the gas in the system can be
written as
 t  Et
where Et is the rate at which dying stars restore both the enriched and unenriched
material into the ISM Et can be written as
Et  Z 
m  Mremt  mmdm
where m  Mrem is the total mass ejected from a star of mass m and m is the lifetime
of a star of mass m When Et is substituted into the gas equation one obtains an
integer-dierential equation which can be solved analytically only by assuming Instan-
taneous Recycling Approximation IRA In this approximation one assumes that all
stars less massive than 1M live forever whereas all stars more massive than 1M die
instantaneously In other words IRA allows us to neglect the stellar lifetimes and solve
analytically equation 431 Under IRA we can dene the returned fraction
R  Z 
m  Mremmdm
which is called fraction because is divided by R 
1 mmdm  1 which depends on the
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 9
normalization of the IMF We also dene the yield per stellar generation as
1  R Z 
mpimmdm
where pim is the stellar yield previously dened Then by substituting R and yi into
equation 432 we obtain
Et  tR
 t1  R
The equation for the evolution of the chemical abundances can be written as
dXiMgas
 Xit  Eit
Eit  Z 
m  MremXit  m  mpim  t  mmdm
contains both the unprocessed and the newly produced element i It is worth noting
that this equation is valid for metals and not for elements which are wholly or partly
destroyed in stars Under the assumption of IRA the above eq becomes
Eit  tRXit  yi1  Rt
When substituted in 437 the equation can be solved analytically with the previous
initial conditions and the solution is
Xi  yiln
the famous solution for the Simple Model The yield which appears in the above solution
is known as eective yield simply dened as the yield yief f that would be deduced if the
system were assumed to be described by the Simple Model
yief f 
ln1
The meaning of the eective yield can be understood with the following example
yief f  yitrue yield then the actual system has attained a higher abundance for the
element i at a given gas fraction 
42 Failure of the Simple Model
The Simple Model predicts too many stars with metallicity lower than FeH -10
dex relative to observations This is known as G-DWARF PROBLEM However the
G-dwarf is no more a problem since several solutions have been suggested
Possible solutions to the G-dwarf problem include
-Slow formation of the solar vicinity by gas infall
-Variable IMF
-Pre-enriched gas
Generally the slow infalling gas is preferred since it is the most realistic suggestion
and produces results in very good agreement with the observations as we will see in the
following

The equation for the evolution of abundances in presence of gas ows transforms into

 Xitt  Eit  XAiAt  XitW t
where At is the accretion rate of matter with abundance of the element i XAi and W t
is the rate of loss of material from the system The case At  W t  0 obviously cor-
responds to the Simple Model The case At  0 W t 6 0 corresponds to the outow
model The easiest way of dening W t in order to solve the equation analytically is to
assume
W t  1  Rt
where   0 is the wind parameter The analytical solution for the equation of metals
which can be integrated between 0 e Xit and between Mgas0  Mtot and Mgast is
1  
ln1  1  
For   0 we recover the solution of the Simple Model
The case of At 6 0 and W t  0 corresponds to the accretion model The easiest
way to choose the accretion rate is

with  being a positive constant dierent from zero The solution of the equation of
metals for a primordial infalling material XAi  0 and  6 1 is

5 Equations with Type Ia and II SNe
In general if one wants to compute in detail the evolution of the abundances of elements
produced and restored into the ISM on long timescales the IRA approximation is a bad
approximation Therefore it is necessary to consider the stellar lifetimes in the chemical
evolution equations and solve them with numerical methods
If Gi is the mass fraction of gas in the form of an element i we can write

MBm is the total minimum and MBM the total maximum mass allowed for binary
systems giving rise to Type Ia SNe Matteucci  Greggio 1986 For the model of a C-O
WD plus a red-giant companion for the progenitors of Type Ia SNe MBM  16M MBm
is more uncertain and often has been taken to be 3M to ensure that the primary star
the initially more massive in the binary system would be massive enough to guarantee
that after accretion from the companion the C-O white dwarf eventually reaches the
Chandrasekhar mass and ignites carbon This formulation of the SN Ia rate was originally
proposed by Greggio and Renzini 1983 Greggio 1996 presented revised criteria for
the choice of MBm In particular the suggested condition for the explosion of the system
where M2e is the envelope mass of the evolving secondary MW D is the mass of the
white dwarf and MCh is the Chandrasekhar mass
MW D  M2e  MCh
For models involving Sub-Chandrasekhar white dwarf masses which have been sug-
gested to explain subluminous Type Ia SNe Greggio obtains MW D  06M and
M2e  015
The masses ML  08 and MU  100M dene the lowest and the highest mass
respectively contributing to the chemical enrichment The function mm describes the
stellar lifetimes The quantity Qmit  m contains all the information about stellar
nucleosynthesis for elements either produced or destroyed inside stars or both and is
dened as in Talbot and Arnett 1973
51 Type Ia SN rates
The single degenerate SD scenario is based on the original suggestion of Whelan and
Iben 1973 namely C-deagration in a WD reaching the Chandrasekhar mass after
accreting material from a star which becomes red giant and lls its Roche lobe An
alternative to the SD scenario is represented by the double degenerate DD scenario
where the merging of two C-O WDs due to gravitational wave radiation creates an object
exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass and exploding by C-deagration Iben and Tutukov
1984 Negative results from observational searches for very close binary systems made
of massive enough WDs Bragaglia et al 1990 has made the DD scenario less attractive
and people to concentrate more on the SD scenario
A recent model has been suggested by Hachisu et al1996 1999 and is based on the
classical scenario of Whelan and Iben 1973 but with a metallicity eect It predicts that
no Type Ia systems can form for FeH 10 This model seems to have some diculty
in explaining the low Fe ratios observed in Damped Lyman-  systems DLAs which
show that even at low metallicities is present the eect of Type Ia SNe Recently
Matteucci  Recchi 2001 showed that there are some problems with this scenario also
12 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
FeH relation in the solar neighbourhood and
in explaining the observed OFe vs
concluded that the best model is still the SD one in the formulation proposed by Greggio
 Renzini 1983 They also showed that the typical timescale for Type Ia SN enrichment
dened as the time tSN Ia when the SN rate reaches the maximum varies strongly from
galaxy to galaxy and that it is not correct to adopt a universal tSN Ia1 Gyr as often
quoted in the literature Their results indicate that for an elliptical galaxy with high
SFR tSN Ia  03  05 Gyr for a spiral Galaxy like the Milky Way tSN Ia  4  5 Gyr
and for an irregular galaxy with a continuous but very low SFR tSN Ia  5 Gyr This
fact has very important consequences on the chemical evolution of galaxies of dierent
morphological types as we will see in the following
6 The formation and evolution of the Milky Way
The rst application of models of chemical evolution is the Milky Way MW Galaxy
for which we have most of the available data Before describing the chemical evolution
of the Galaxy I recall some of the ideas proposed for the formation of the MW Eggen
Lynden-Bell  Sandage 1962 suggested a rapid collapse for the formation of the Galaxy
lasting  3  108 years implying that no spread in the age of Globular Clusters should
be observed They based their suggestion on the nding that halo stars have high radial
velocities whitnessing the initial fast collapse Later on Searle  Zinn 1978 proposed a
central collapse but also that the outer halo formed by merging of large fragments taking
place over a considerable timescale  1 Gyr More recently Berman  Suchov 1991
proposed the hot Galaxy picture an initial strong burst of star formation which inhibited
further star formation for a few gigayears while a strong galactic wind was created
Subsequently the remainder of the proto-Galaxy contracted and cooled to form the
major stellar components observed today At the present time the most popular idea
on the formation of the Galaxy is that the inner halo formed rather quickly on a time
scale of 05-1 Gyr whereas the outer halo formed more slowly by mergers of fragments
or accretion from satellites of the MW see Matteucci 2001
61 Models for the Milky Way
 SERIAL FORMATION APPROACH halo thick and thin disk formed in sequence
as a continuous process eg Matteucci  Francois 1989
 PARALLEL FORMATION APPROACH the various Galactic components start
forming at the same time and from the same gas but evolve at dierent rates eg Pardi
Ferrini  Matteucci 1995 At variance with the previous scenario it predicts overlapping
of stars belonging to the dierent components
 TWO-INFALL APPROACH the evolution of the halo and disk are totally indepen-
dent and they form out of two separate infall episodes overlapping in metallicity is also
predicted eg Chiappini Matteucci  Gratton 1997 Chang et al 1999 Alibes et al
 STOCHASTIC APPROACH in the early halo phases mixing was not ecient thus
pollution from single SNe Tsujimoto et al 1999 Argast et al 2000 Oey 2000 can be
seen in very metal poor stars This approach predicts a large spread in the abundance
ratios at very low FeH even larger than observed
62 The two-infall model
Here I describe in more detail the two-infall approach Chiappini et al 1997 since it

al 1999 Chiappini et al 2001
 The relative abundance ratios as functions of the relative metallicity relative to the
Sun XFe vs FeH they are interpreted as due to the time-delay between Type Ia
and II SNe In fact for the -elements the slowly declining Fe ratio at low  FeH
halo phase is normally interpreted as due to the pollution from massive stars whereas

Figure 1 Predicted star formation rate in the halo-thick disk phase and in the thin disk phase
during the evolution of the Milky Way Notice that because of the existence of a threshold in
the gas density the SFR halts in between the two major episodes of infall and oscillates in the
last phases of the evolution of the disk The models are from Chiappini et al 2001
the abrupt change in slope occurring at  F eH  10 dex is due to the Type Ia SNe
restoring the bulk of iron From the Fe vs FeH diagram one can infer the timescale
for the formation of the halo h  15-20 Gyr Matteucci and Francois 1989 Chiappini
et al 1997 just by means of the age-FeH relationship which indicates the time at
which the metallicity of the turning point is reached In Figure 3 we do not show the
usual plot but FeO vs OH since in this plot are evident some features which do not
appear in the classical diagram In particular the data show evidence for a gap around
OH -03 dex corresponding to FeH  -10 dex Gratton et al 2000 This gap is
well reproduced by the model which predicts a hiatus no more than 1 Gyr in the SFR
between the end of the thick-disk phase and the beginning of the formation of the thin
disk This hiatus produces in fact a situation where O is no longer produced whereas Fe
is produced and this is revealed by the increase of Fe at constant H This eect
has been observed also for FeMg vs MgH by Furhmann 1998 The model shown

64 Applications to the whole disk
 Abundance Gradients are known to exist along the Galactic disk from data from
various sources HII regions PNe B stars These data suggest that the gradient for
oxygen is  007 dexkpc in the galoctocentric distance range 4-14 kpc It is not yet
clear if the slope is unique or if there is a change in slope as a function of the galactocentric
distance Similar gradients are found for N and Fe see Matteucci 2001 and references
therein

OH relation in the solar neighbourhood The data are from
Gratton et al2000 and the model continuous line from Chiappini et al2001 In this gure
is evident the existence of a gap in the data at around OH-03 dex corresponding to FeH
 -10 dex which is also predicted by the model
disk while H2 follows the light distribution No models can explain the two distributions
The total gas increases towards the center with a peak at 4-6 kpc
 The SFR Distribution is obtained from various tracers Lyman- continuum pul-
sars SN remnants molecular clouds and shows that the SFR increases with decreasing
galactocentric distance reaching a peak at 4-6 kpc in correspondence of the gas peak
In order to t gradients SFR and gas one has to assume that the disk formed inside-
out in agreement with a previous suggestion by Larson 1976 and that the SFR should
be a strongly varying function of the galactocentric distance In Figure 4 is shown a
comparison between an inside-out model and the abundance gradient the gas star and
SFR distributions

65 The Role of Radial Flows in the evolution of the Galactic Disk
The gas infalling onto the disk can induce radial inows by transferring angular momen-
tum to the gas in the disk Angular momentum transfer can be due to the gas viscosity
in the disk and induce inows in the inner parts of the disk and outows in the outer
parts All viscous models suggest that metallicity gradients can be steepened by radial
inows especially if an outer star formation cut-o is assumed Clarke 1989 Yoshii 
Sommer-Larsen 1989 All models agree that the velocity of radial inows should be
low v  2 kmsec Observationally is not clear if these radial ows exist Edmunds 
Greenhow 1995 by means of analytical models of galactic chemical evolution concluded
that there is no simple one-way eect of radial ows on abundance gradients Portinari
 Chiosi 2000 suggested that radial inows may represent a possible explanation of
the peak of the gas at 4-6 kpc In our opinion radial ows if they exist are never the
main cause for the formation of abundance gradients
18 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
66 The Role of the IMF in the evolution of the Galactic Disk
Abundance gradients in principle can be obtained by a variation of the IMF along the
disk One can assume either that more massive stars form in external regions or the
contrary that more low mass stars form in external regions It has been shown convinc-
ingly that neither of the two options work Carigi 1996 Chiappini et al 2000 and that
there is no evidence in favor of such variations along the Galactic disk Therefore we can
exclude the variation of the IMF as the main cause of abundance gradients and conclude
that the best agreement with the observed properties of the Galactic disk is obtained by
assuming a constant IMF
67 Scenarios for Bulge Formation
Various scenarios have been proposed insofar for the formation of the Galactic bulge but
only one seems to reproduce the observed abundance pattern Here I recall the main
scenarios
 Accretion of extant stellar systems which eventually settle in the center of the
Galaxy
 Accumulation of gas at the center of the Galaxy and subsequent evolution with
either fast or slow star formation
 Accumulation either rapid or slow of metal enriched gas from the halo or thick disk
in the Galaxy center
 Formation occurs out of inow of metal enriched gas from the thin-disk
The metallicity distribution of stars in the bulge as well as the Fe vs FeH relations
help in selecting the most probable scenario and suggest that a fast accumulation of gas
in the Galactic center accompanied by fast star formation is the best scenario In this
framework the bulge must have formed contemporarily to the inner halo on a similar
timescale
In Figures 5 and 6 we show some model predictions compared with the
metallicity distribution of bulge stars and the predicted Fe vs FeH ratios for the
bulge together with the predictions for the solar neighbourhood The model for the
bulge presented in the two gures Matteucci Romano  Molaro 1999 assumes a much
stronger star formation rate than in the solar neighbourhood by a factor of 10 with
the same nucleosynthesis prescriptions and a timescale for bulge formation of 05 Gyr
as opposed to 8 Gyr in the solar vicinity In Figure 5 it is evident that the best model
to reproduce the stellar metallicity distribution requires a Salpeter 1955 IMF which is
sligthly atter than that used for the solar neighbourhood Scalo 1986 The predicted
Fe ratios in Figure 6 indicate that the bulge stars should show overabundances of
-elements for most of the FeH range as it seems also suggested by observations Mc
William  Rich 1994 Barbuy 1999 This is a consequence of the time-delay between
Type Ia and II SNe coupled with a very fast evolution in the bulge as compared to the
solar vicinity In fact in this case high values of FeH are reached in the gas before
a substantial number of SNe Ia has the time to restore the bulk of iron The contrary
occurs in a system with lower star formation than in the solar neighbourhood such as
the external regions of the disk and irregular galaxies In these systems we expect that
the overabundance of -elements relative to Fe is maintained only for a short interval of
FeH see Pagel 1997 Matteucci 2001
7 Disks of Other Spirals
Abundance gradients
Abundance gradients in dexkpc are known to exist also in the disk of other spirals
showing that they are steeper in smaller disks but this correlation disappears if the

distribution of bulge stars The data are from McWilliam  Rich 1994 and the models con-
tinuous lines from Matteucci et al 1999 Each panel corresponds to a model with a dierent
IMF slope as indicated
gradients are expressed in units of dexscalelength thus indicating the existence of a
universal slope per unit scalelength eg Garnett 1998 Another remarkable charac-
teristic about abundance gradients in other spirals is that they appear to be atter in
galaxies with central bars suggesting that the dynamical eect of the bar can inuence
the evolution of the disk
The SFR
The SFR is measured mainly from H emission Kennicutt 1998 and implies a cor-
relation with the total surface gas density HIH2 as discussed in section 21
Gas distributions
Gas distributions especially the HI distribution is known for a fair sample of spirals
There are indications of dierences between eld and cluster spirals eg Skillman et al

Studies of integrated colors of spiral disks reect the observed abundance gradients
and are well reproduced by an inside-out formation of disks similar to what assumed for
the Milky Way Josey  Arimoto 1992 Jimenez et al 1998 Prantzos  Boissier 2000
8 Conclusions on the Milky Way and other spirals
The comparison between observations and models for the Milky Way suggests that
 The disk of the Galaxy formed mostly by infall of primordial or very metal poor
gas accumulating faster in the inner than in the outer regions inside-out scenario ie
DR decreases with decreasing R
 In the framework of the inside-out scenario the SFR should be a strongly varying
function of the galactocentric distance In particular it should either depend on the total
surface mass density feed-back mechanism or on the angular circular velocity of gas
Both formulations for the SFR are supported by observations Under the assumption of
a strongly varying SFR the observed abundance gradients can be nicely reproduced
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 21
 Radial ows probably are not the main cause of gradients but can help in reproducing
the gas prole
 A constant IMF in time and space should be preferred since variable IMFs have
been tested and they cannot reproduce all of the observational constraints of the solar
neighbourhood and the whole disk at the same time
 The properties of the disks of other spirals also indicate an inside-out disk formation
 In the framework of semi-analytical models of galaxy formation Mo Mao  White
1998 the evolution of galaxy disks can be described by means of scaling laws calibrated
on the Galaxy with Vc and  as parameters Jimenez et al 1998 Prantzos  Boissier
2000 where Vc is a measure of the mass of the dark halo and  is a measure of the
specic angular momentum of the halo
 Dynamical processes such as the formation of a central bar can inuence the evolu-
tion of disks and deserve more attention in the future
 Abundance ratios eg
Fe in stars al large galactocentric distances can give
us a clue to interpret the formation of the disk and the halo inside-out or outside-in
In fact in a typical inside-out scenario we predict that the Fe ratios would decrease
with galactocentric distance due to the weaker and sometimes intermittent SF regime
whereas in an outside-in scenario we would expect the contrary due to the faster evolution
of the more external region which quickly consume the gas before Type Ia SNe have time
to restore the bulk of Fe
 The predictions of chemical evolution models can be tested in a cosmological context
to study the galaxy surface brightness and size evolution as a function of redshift Roche
et al 1998 have already done that and suggested that a size and luminosity evolution
as suggested by the inside-out scenario ts better the observations
 Inside-out formation of the Galaxy is suggested also by the fact that the globular
clusters of the inner halo are coeval t  05 Gyr Rosenberg et al 1999 whereas the
age dierence seems to increase in the outer halo
 The metallicity distribution of stars in the Bulge as well as the observed Fe ratios
suggest a very fast formation of the Bulge  05-08 Gyr due a the very fast SFR as
predicted by succesfull chemical evolution models and by Elmegreen 1999
9 Elliptical Galaxies
Elliptical galaxies are mainly found in galaxy clusters they show a large range of
luminosities and masses and are made by stars as old as those in globular clusters No
cold gas is observed in these galaxies but hot X-ray gas halos are present Because of
their large masses and metal content they are probably the most important factories of
metals in the universe
91 Observational properties
Here I recall the main observational features of elliptical galaxies
 The existence of Color-Magnitude and color - velocity dispersion o relations col-
ors become redder with increasing luminosity and mass eg Bower et al 1992 is inter-
preted as a metallicity eect namely as the fact that the metallicity decreases outwards
similarly to what happens in spiral disks
 The existence of a M g2o where M g2 is a metallicity index relation reinforces the
previous point Bender et al 1993 Bernardi et al 1998 Colless et al 1999 Kuntschner
et al 2001
 Inside ellipticals M g2 correlates also with the escape velocity vesc as rst shown
22 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
by Franx  Illingworth 1990 indicating that the magnesium index is larger where the
escape velocity is larger
 MLB increases by a factor of  3 from faint to bright ellipticals implying a tilt of
the fundamental plane of ellipticals Bender et al 1992 The fundamental plane is the
particular plane occupied by these galaxies in the space dened by the stellar velocity
dispersion the eective radius and the surface brigthness
 Abundance gradients inside ellipticals have been measured by means of metallicity
indices such as M g2 and  F e  Carollo et al 1993 Davies et al 1993 Kobayashi 
Arimoto 1999 These gradients correspond roughly to a gradient in FeH of the stellar
component of F eHlogr  03
The average metallicity of the stellar component in ellipticals is  F eH  03dex
from -08 to 03
 By comparing synthetic metallicity indices with the observed ones some authors
Worthey et al 1992 Weiss et al 1995 Kuntschner et al 2001 have suggested that
the average stellar  M gF e  is larger than zero from 005 to  03 dex in nuclei
of giant ellipticals Moreover there is indication that  M gF e  increases with
increasing o Mgal and luminosity Worthey et al 1992 Jorgensen 1999 Kuntschner
et al 2001
In particular the relation found by Kuntschner et al 2001 is MgFe030006logo
052015
92 Formation of Ellipticals
Several mechanisms have been suggested for the formation and evolution of elliptical
galaxies in particular
 Early monolithic collapse of a gas cloud or early merging of lumps of gas where
dissipation plays a fundamental role Larson 1974 Arimoto  Yoshii 1987 Matteucci 
Tornambe 1987  In this scenario the star formation stops soon after a galactic wind
develops and the galaxy evolves passively since then
 Bursts of star formation in merging subsystems made of gas Tinsley  Larson 1979
In this picture star formation stops after the last burst and gas is lost via stripping or
 Early merging of lumps containing gas and stars in which some dissipation is present
Bender et al 1993
 Merging of early formed stellar systems in a wide redshift range and preferentially
at late epochs Kaumann et al 1993 A burst of star formation can occur during the
major merging where  30 of the stars can be formed Kaumann 1996
The main dierence between the monolithic collapse scenario and the hierarchical
merging relies in the time of galaxy formation occurring quite early in the former scenario
and continuously in the latter scenario As we will see there are arguments either in
favour of the monolithic or the hierarchical scenario
93 Formation of Ellipticals at low z
Here I recall some of the main arguments in favor of the formation of ellipticals at low
redshifts
 Relative large values of the H index measured in a sample of nearby ellipticals
which could indicate prolonged star formation activity up to 2 Gyr ago Gonzalez 1993
Trager et al 1998
 The tight relations in the fundamental plane are due to a conspiracy of age and
metallicity in the sense that it should exist an age-metallicity anticorrelation implying
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 23
that the more metal rich galaxies are also younger Ferreras et al 1999 Trager et al
 The apparent paucity of high luminosity ellipticals at z  1 compared to now claimed
by a series of authors Kaumann et al 1993 Zepf 1997 Menanteau et al 1999
94 Formation of Ellipticals at high z
Here I recall the arguments in favor of a formation of ellipticals at high redshift
 The tightness of the color-central velocity dispersion relation found for Virgo and
If the formation of ellipticals were a continuous
Coma galaxies Bower et al 1992
process we should expect a much larger spread in the galaxy colors for a given central
velocity dispersion In particular the argument goes like that from the observed color
scatter one can derive tH  tF  2Gyr where tH is the Hubble time and tF the time of
galaxy formation If tH  15 Gyr then the youngest ellipticals must have formed  13

95 Models for ellipticals based on galactic winds
Monolithic models assume that ellipticals suer a strong star formation and quickly
produce galactic winds when the energy from SNe injected into the ISM equates the
potential energy of the gas Then star formation is assumed to halt after the development
of a galactic wind In this framework the evolution of ellipticals crucially depends on
the time at which a galactic wind occurs tGW  For this reason it is extremely important
to understand the SN feedback and star formation process The condition for the onset
of a wind can be written as
The thermal energy of gas due to SNe and stellar wind heating is
EthISM  EBgas
EthISM  EthSN  Ethw
EthSN  Z t
SN RSN tdt
Ethw  Z t

for the contribution from SNe and stellar winds respectively The quantity RSN repre-
sents the SN rate II and Ia The quantities SN  SN o with o  1051erg where o
is the typical SN blast wave energy  and w  wEw with Ew  1049erg typical energy
injected by a 20M star taken as representative are the eciencies for the energy trans-
fer from SNe II and Ia into the ISM These eciencies w and SN  can be assumed as
free parameters or be calculated from the results of the evolution of a SN remnant in the
24 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
ISM and the evolution of stellar winds The SN feedback is in fact a crucial parameter
The formulation of Cox 1972 for the eciency of energy injection from SNe derives
from following the evolution of the shock wave produced by the explosion into an ISM
with constant density
SN  072o erg

elapsed from the SN explosion and

years where tc is the cooling time and tSN is the time
SN  22otSN tc062 erg
for tSN  tc
With these prescriptions only few  of o are deposited into the ISM see Bradamante
et al 1998 However multiple SN explosion should change the situation Unfortunately
very few calculations of this type are available An important point to consider is also
that SNe Ia which explode after Type II SNe should provide more energy into the ISM
than Type II SNe since they explode in an already formed cavity see Recchi Matteucci

The SFR is usually assumed to be

and that
SF  coll  f f
with coll and f f being the collapse and the free-fall timescale respectively Since
dynamical timescales are longer for more massive galaxies the eciency of star formation
should decrease with galactic mass The eciency  coupled with the increase of the
potential well as ML increases leads to the fact that more massive galaxies form stars for
a longer period before suering a galactic wind This fact has been invoked for explaining
the observed mass-metallicity relation Larson 1974 However this is at variance with
the observed MgFe vs o relation since in this scenario the more massive ellipticals
should show the lowest MgFe
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 25
96 Failure of Larsons Model
There are dierent ways of obtaining that M gF e in the stellar component increases
when the galactic mass ML increases These ways are
 Dierent timescales for star formation Worthey et al 1992 in the sense that star
formation should be more ecient in more massive galaxies   M 
L In this case the
situation could be such that a galactic wind occurs earlier in more massive systems the
inverse wind scenario Matteucci 1994
 A variable IMF from galaxy to galaxy favoring more massive stars Mg producers
in more massive galaxies Worthey et al 1992 Matteucci 1994
 Dierent amounts andor concentrations of dark matter as functions of ML In par-
ticular less dark matter should be present in the most massive systems Matteucci
Ponzone  Gibson 1998 As a consequence of this again galactic winds occur earlier
in more massive objects
 A selective loss of metals more massive systems loose more Fe relative to -elements
than less massive ones Worthey et al 1992
As mentioned before Matteucci 1994 proposed a model that she called inverse wind
model where the eciency of star formation is an increasing function of galactic mass
thus implying a shorter period of star formation in massive ellipticals
In fact the
eciency of star formation is chosen in such a way that in massive ellipticals the galactic
wind occurs before than in less massive ones This produces the increase of the MgFe
ratio as a function of galactic mass This approach bears a resemblance with the merging
scenario of Tinsley  Larson 1979 where the eciency of star formation was assumed
to increase with the total mass of the system In the inverse wind model a very massive
elliptical of ML  1012M starts developing a wind before 1 Gyr from the beginning of
star formation whereas a small ellipticals form stars for a longer period As a result
the average  M gF e  is larger in massive than in small ellipticals The same eect
can be obtained by varying the IMF in such a way that more massive ellipticals tend
to form more massive stars It is worth noting that this second hypothesis could also
explain the tilt of the fundamental plane in MLB On the other hand the hypothesis
of the variable dark matter does not produce relevant eects as shown by Matteucci et
al 1998 The only assumption which has not been tested quantitatively is the selective
loss of metals The main problem with all of these alternatives is in any case the lack of
a good physical justication depending on the poorly known processes of star formation
and SN feeback and in the future some eort should be devoted to these elds
It is worth noting that the hierarchical clustering scenario for galaxy formation cannot
produce a solution to the observed MgFe trend in ellipticals In fact it rather predicts
the contrary as shown by Thomas 1999 and Thomas et al 2002 In fact in the hier-
achical clustering the period of star formation in the most massive ellipticals is predicted
to be the longest thus favoring low MgFe ratios in massive objects as shown in Figure
97 Averaged Stellar Metallicities
The metallicity in elliptical galaxies always refers to the metal content of the stars in
particular of the stellar population dominating in the visual light For this reason we
should dene the average stellar metallicity In particular the average metallicity of a
composite stellar population averaged on the mass is
 Xi m
S1 Z S1
XiSdS

Figure 7 Predicted Fe vs velocity dispersion for elliptical galaxies Data are compared
with predictions obtained by adopting the star formation history assumed in hierarchical clus-
tering models for galaxy formationThe models and the gure are from Thomas et al 2002
where 1 refers to the specic time t1 and S1 is the total mass of stars ever born This
is the real average metallicity but in order to compare models and observations it is
more appropriate to dene the metallicity averaged on the visual light In particular the
average metallicity of a composite stellar population averaged on the light is
 Xi L Pij nij XiLV j
Pij nijLV j
where nij is the number of stars in the abundance interval Xi and luminosity interval
It is worth noting that  Xi m is larger than  Xi L for galaxies with ML  109M
since metal poor giants dominate the visual light whereas they are similar for larger
masses Yoshii  Arimoto 1987
98 Multi-Zone Models
There are two multi-zone chemical evolution models for ellipticals available in the lit-
erature Martinelli et al 1998 Tantalo et al 1998 Martinelli et al 1998 assumed
that the elliptical galaxy is divided in several concentric shells of thickness Ri The
binding energy of the gas in each shell is computed after assuming a dark matter halo as
described before The model predicts that a galactic wind develops rst in the external
regions and then gradually in the more internal ones in agreement with the observed
M g2 vs vesc relation As a consequence of this the star formation lasts for a shorter
time in the external regions with the consequence that an abundance gradient is created
in agreement with observations This model also predicts that we should observe higher

MgFe ratios at larger galactocentric distances the contrary of what should happens
in the disks of spirals In this case we can speak of outside-in formation Unfortunately
the available data inside galaxies do not allow yet to observe such an eect It is worth
28 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
noting that this model can reproduce very well the observed color gradients in ellipticals
as shown in Figure 8
10 Conclusions on Ellipticals
The main conclusions that we can draw from comparing theoretical models and obser-
vations for ellipticals can be summarized as follows
 In order to explain the observed  M gF e  0 in giant ellipticals the dominant
stellar population should have formed on a time scale no longer than 3-5 108 yr which
corresponds to the time at which the SNe Ia rate reaches a maximum in these systems
with strong star formation
 Uncertainties in the stellar yields of Fe and Mg from dierent authors can change
the value of the MgFe ratio but do not aect the conclusion above
 This observational nding argues against a hierarchical clustering formation scenario
and favors the fact that ellipticals especially those in clusters are mostly old systems
see also Menanteau et al 2001
 The increase of the MgFe ratio with galactic mass suggests either that more mas-
sive ellipticals are older systems or that the IMF is not constant among ellipticals or
 Abundance gradients in ellipticals can be produced by biased winds and this would
imply that MgFe increases with increasing galactocentric distance
 Better calibrations for metallicity indices are necessary especially taking into ac-
count non-solar ratios in stellar tracks before drawing rm conclusions
11 Evolution of Dwarf Galaxies
Dwarf Irregular DIG and Blue Compact BCG galaxies are very interesting objects
for studying galaxy evolution since they are relatively unevolved objects see Kunth 
Ostlin 2000 for a recent exhaustive review In bottom-up cosmological scenarios they
should be the rst self- gravitating systems to form thus they could also be important
contributors to the population of systems giving rise to QSO-absorption lines at high
redshift DLAs
In general they are rather simple objects with low metallicity and
large gas content suggesting that they are either young or have undergone discontinuous
star formation activity bursts An important characteristic of these systems is that
they show a distinctive spread in their physical properties such as chemical abundances
versus fraction of gas Matteucci and Chiosi 1983 were among the rst in studying the
chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies They adopted analytical models as those described
in section 3 and showed that closed-box models cannot account for the Z-log distribution
even if the number of bursts varies from galaxy to galaxy and suggested possible solutions
to explain the observed spread
 a dierent IMFs
 b dierent amounts of galactic wind
 c dierent amounts of infall
Later on Matteucci and Tosi 1985 presented a numerical model where galactic winds
powered by SNe were taken into account They concluded that dierent wind rates from
galaxy to galaxy could explain the observed spread in ON vs log but not the spread in
the NO vs OH diagram suggesting that additional processes could have contributed
to that For example dierent amounts of primary N from galaxy to galaxy Kumai
and Tosa 1992 suggested that dierent fractions of dark matter in dierent objects
could explain the observed spread in the Z-log diagram Pilyugin 1993 forwarded
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 29
the idea that the spread in the properties of these galaxies ie HeH vs OH and
NO vs OH are due to self-pollution of the HII regions coupled with enriched or
dierential galactic winds Dierential winds should carry out of the galaxy certain
elements more than others for example the metals ejected by SN II should be favored In
more recent models Marconi et al 1994 Bradamante et al 1998 the novelty was the
contribution to the chemical enrichment of SNe of dierent type IIIa and Ib together
with dierential winds In these papers the assumption was made that the products of
SN II are lost more easily than the products of stars ending as WDs such as C and
N Larsen et al 2001 studied the chemical evolution of gas rich dwarf galaxies and
concluded that primary N production from massive stars is not necessary to reproduce
the NO vs OH and that the spread in this relation is likely to be due to the time-delay
eect in the production of N relative to the production of O In fact in a starbursting
regime when the starburst fades the elements produced by Type II SNe are no more
produced whereas the elements produced on long timescales by single stars and Type
Ia SNe are still produced This causes the typical saw-tooth behaviour see Figure 9
Therefore the spread can be due to the fact that some objects are observed at dierent
stages of the burstinterburts regime They also concluded that ordinary winds are better
than enriched ones in reproducing the properties of these objects The existence of a
luminosity-metallicity relation although with spread can be an indication for galactic
winds acting more eciently in low mass than in high mass high potential well objects
111 Evidences for Galactic Winds
Meurer et al 1992 Papaderos et al 1994 Lequeux et al 1995 and Marlowe et al
1995 all suggested the existence of galactic winds in dwarf starbursting galaxies The
evidence is gathered by the indication of outowing material travelling at a speed larger
than the assumed mass of the objects Papaderos et al estimated a galactic wind owing
at a velocity of 1320 Kmsec for VIIZw403 The escape velocity estimated for this galaxy
being 50 Kmsec Lequeux et al1995 suggested a galactic wind in Haro2MKn33
owing at a velocity of  200Kmsec Martin 19961998 found supershells in 12
dwarfs including IZw18 and concluded that they imply an outow which in some cases
can become a wind namely the material is lost from the galaxy
Recent chemo-dynamical simulations for one instantaneous starburst also suggest the
possibiliy of galactic winds and that these winds are metal enriched MacLow  Ferrara
1999 Recchi et al 2001
112 Results for BCG from chemical models
Purely chemical models no dynamics have been computed by several authors by varying
the number of bursts the time of occurrence of bursts tburst the star formation eciency
the type of galactic wind the IMF and the nucleosynthesis prescriptions Marconi et al
1994 Kunth et al1995 Bradamante et al1998 The main conclusions of these papers
can be summarized as follows
 The number of bursts should be Nbursts  10 the star formation eciency should
vary from 01 to 07 Gyr1 for either Salpeter or Scalo 1986 IMF but Salpeter IMF is
favored
 Enriched winds carrying out material at a rate proportional to the star formation
rate seem to be preferred but see Larsen et al 2001 The observed scatter in the
observational properties can be due either to the winds or to the delay in the production
of dierent elements
 If the burst duration is relatively short no more than 100 Myr SNe II dominate

Figure 9 The logNO vs 12 logOH for a sample of BCG The data are from Recchi
2002 Overimposed are three models with a single burst of star formation and dierent star
formation eciency In particular the dotted line corresponds to an eciency   1Gyr1 the
continuous line to   25Gyr1 and the dashed line to   5Gyr1 The burst duration is 100
Myr As one can see the saw-tooth behaviour typical of a bursting mode of star fotmation is
evident
the chemical evolution and energetics of starburst galaxies while stellar winds seem to
be negligible after the onset of SNe II
 The OFe ratios tend to be overabundant due to the predominance of Type II SNe
during the bursts Models with a large number of bursts Nburst10 - 15 can give negative
OFe
113 Results from chemo-dynamical models
Recent chemo-dynamical models Recchi et al 20012002 assuming an instantaneous
starburst but following in great detail the evolution of several chemical elements H He
C N O Mg Si and Fe and adopting an eciency for SN II energy transfer SN II 0003
and for SN Ia SN Ia10 suggest that the starburst triggers indeed a galactic wind see
Figure 10 In particular the metals leave the galaxy more easily than the unprocessed
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 31
Figure 10 Chemo-dynamical simulation of an instantaneous starburst from Recchi et al
2001 The development of a galactic wind is evident along the z-axis since the assumed
conguration is attenedThe age of the burst is indicated in Myr
gas and among the metals the SN Ia ejecta leave the galaxy more easily than the SN
II ejecta This is due to the assumed eciencies for energy transfer for the two types
of SNe This assumption is in turn based on the fact that Type Ia SNe explode in an
already heated and raried medium thanks to the Type II SNe which explode rst and
therefore can transfer all of their energy into the ISM As a consequence of this type of
evolution the following conclusions can be drawn
 A selective loss of metals seems to occur in dwarf gas-rich galaxies
 As a consequence of the selective winds the Fe ratios inside the galaxy are
predicted to be larger than the Fe ratios outside the galaxy In fact the products of
SNe Ia are lost more eciently than those of SN II
 At variance with previous studies most of the metals are already in the cold gas
phase after 8-10 Myr owing to the fact that the superbubble does not break immediately
the SNe II inject only a fraction of their initial blast wave energy into the ISM and
thermal conduction can act eciently
32 Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium
 The model well reproduces the properties of IZw18 the most metal poor galaxy
known locally if two bursts are assumed and are separated by 300 Myr interval
114 Dwarf galaxies and DLA Systems
Finally before concluding this section we would like to draw the attention upon the
fact that there are similarities between BCG DIG and DLAs or more in general between
DLAs and systems with a low level of star formation
The nature of DLA systems is under debate and the abundance ratios measured there
can be used as a diagnostic to infer their nature and age Matteucci et al
suggested that some DLA showing high NO ratio could be BCG suering selective
winds In this respect the similarity between DLAs and IZw18 may suggest that IZw18
is a survivor proto-galaxy which has just started forming stars If this is true dwarf
irregular galaxies should be born at any time during the age of the universe unlike
elliptical galaxies which appear to have formed a long time ago and in a short time
interval see section 9
Plots of Fe vs FeH and plots of Fe vs redshift should be used to infer the
nature and the age of these objects when compared with chemical evolution predictions
The observed abundance ratios seem to indicate that DLAs show almost solar Fe
ratios at low FeH Pettini et al 1999 Centurion et al 2000 This is an indication
that they are objects where the star formation proceeded slowly and that they have
probably started to form stars long before the redshift at which we observe them This
could indicate that we are looking at the external regions of disks or at dwarf starbursting
systems in the interburst phases see Figure 11 However more data are necessary to
assess this point One common problem related to the measurement of the abundances
in DLAs is that some elements are dust depleted such as Si and Fe and therefore one
should try to observe non-refractory elements such as N O S and Zn One should also
remember that Si and Ca do not strongly behave as -elements since they are produced
in a non-negligible way in SNe Ia
12 Chemical Enrichment of the ICM
After having discussed the chemical evolution of galaxies it is important to conclude
by studying how the evolution of galaxies can aect the chemical enrichment of the
intracluster ICM and intergalactic medium In the past years a great deal of work has
been presented on the subject The rst work on chemical enrichment of the ICM was by
Gunn  Gott 1972 Larson  Dinerstein 1975 Vigroux 1977 Himmes  Biermann
1988
In the following years Matteucci  Vettolani 1988 started a more detailed
approach to the problem followed by David et al 1991 Arnaud et al 1992 Renzini
et al 1993 and many others The majority of these papers assumed that galactic winds
mainly from ellipticals are responsible for the ICM chemical enrichment Alternatively
the abundances in the ICM could be due to ram pressure stripping Himmes  Biermann
1988 or to pre-galactic Population III stars White  Rees 1978
121 Models for the ICM
Here we will describe briey the metodology developed by Matteucci  Vettolani 1988
hereafter MV88 Starting from SN driven galactic wind models for ellipticals see
section 9 they computed the ejected masses vs nal baryonic total galactic masses for
galaxies of dierent initial luminous masses from 109 to 1012M

to explain the observations d only if there is a continuously forming population of HSB disks
between z4 and z1 then they can account for the metallicities of the DLAs
where i refers to either a single chemical element or the total gas Then they integrated
i over the cluster mass function obtained from the Schechter 1986 luminosity func-
tion LF by assuming that only E and S0 galaxies contribute to the chemical enrichment

122 MV88 Results
MV88 considered 4 galaxy clusters Perseus A2199 Coma and Virgo for which f  n
M  MF e and Mgas were known
In Table 1 we show the results they obtained for
the 4 clusters concerning the total masses ejected by all galaxies in the clusters in the
form of total gas and Fe compared with the observed ones It is immediate to see from
Table 1 that their model could reproduce well the total amount of Fe but they failed
in reproducing the total gas mass However this is not a failure of the model but the
indication that most of the gas in clusters has a primordial origin namely has never been
processed inside stars The same conclusion was reached later by David et al 1991
and Renzini et al 1993 among others but see Chiosi 2000
Therefore the XF eXF e shown in Table 2 was calculated as MF epredMgasobs
The predicted Fe abundance in the ICM relative to the Sun is in agreement with the
observations then and now XF eXF e obs  03  05 Rothenug  Arnaud 1985
White 2000 Low values for MgFe and SiFe were predicted due to the assumption
that all the Fe produced by Type Ia SNe was soon or later ejected into the ICM as
shown in Table 2 With Salpeter IMF Type Ia SNe contribute  50 of the total Fe
123 Fe Ratios in the ICM
Models including Type Ia and II SNe predict an asymmetry in the Fe ratios  0
inside the ellipticals and  0 in the ICM due to the dierent roles of SNe II and Ia in
Fe production Renzini et al 1993 ASCA results Mutshotzky et al 1996 originally
suggested FeICM  0 02 dex However Ishimaru  Arimoto 1999 pointed out
that  Fe  0 in the ICM if the meteoritic Fe abundance is adopted instead of the
photospheric value adopted in the other paper On the basis of the ASCA results on the
overabundance of the -elements Matteucci  Gibson 1995 discussed how to reproduce
the Fe0 ratios both in stars and ICM They adopted the same SN feedback as MV88
and dark matter halos were also included in the galaxy models They concluded that
it is possible to obtain overabundances of the -elements in the ICM only if not all of
Francesca Matteucci Chemical Evolution of Galaxies and Intracluster Medium 35
the produced Fe is lost from the galaxies ie only early winds On the other hand
MV88 had assumed that all the Fe is soon or later ejected into the ICM They concluded
that a at IMF x095 plus only early winds can reproduce FeICM  0 A similar
conclusion was reached by Loewenstein  Mutshotzky 1996 However the situation is
not very realistic since the gas in cluster galaxies is likely to be stripped soon or later
because of environmental eects and the Fe ratios in the ICM are likely to be solar or
undersolar More recently Martinelli et al 2000 recomputed the ICM enrichment by
adopting a more realistic model for the evolution of ellipticals multi-zone The model
already described in section 9 predicts a more extended period of galactic wind and
more metals and gas in the ICM than the one-zone model with only early winds They
computed the evolution of abundances vs
redshift for a constant LF and concluded
that there is no evolution between z1 and z0 and FeICM 0 at the present time
Very recently Pipino et al 2002 computed the chemical enrichment of the ICM as a
function of redshift by considering the evolution of the cluster luminosity function and
conrmed the conclusions of Martinelli et al
2000 Very recent data from XMM-
Newton Gastaldello  Molendi 2002 seem to indicate a low OFe 0 ratio for the
ICM thus supporting models where Type Ia SNe are ecient and all the produced Fe is
ejected into the ICM In Figure 12 we show the recent results of Pipino et al 2002 In
the upper panel of Fig 12 is indicated the predicted evolution as a function of redshift
of the thermal energy per particle in the ICM due to galactic winds from E and S0
galaxiesIn the lower panel is shown the evolution of the total mass of Fe ejected by the
cluster galaxies into the ICM as a function of redshift It is worth noting that 1 keV per
particle is the energy required to explain the observed LX  T relation in clusters eg
Borgani et al 2001 The model in Figure 12 shows that the energy injected by SNe is
not enough at maximum 04 keV and that other sources of energy are required such as
active galactic nuclei and QSO Figure 12 also shows how important is the contribution
from Type Ia SNe to the chemical enrichment and energetic content of the ICM In fact
SNe II are important in triggering the galactic wind but after star formation stops the
wind is sustained only by Type Ia SNe
124 Fe ratios and IMLR
Abundance ratios and the Iron Mass to Light Ratio IMLR are good tests for the
evolution of galaxies in clusters since they do not depend on the total cluster gas mass
The IMLR is dened as Renzini et al 1993
IM LR  M ICM
1269
and the IMLR  h05 For H0  50 the IMLR002 ML Arnaud et al 1992
practically constant among rich clusters but it drops for poor clusters and groups On
the one hand the IMLR can impose constraints on the IMF in cluster galaxies on the
baryonic history of the clustersgroups and on the number of SNe exploded in galaxies
In fact the most straightforward interpretation of the constancy of the IMLR among
rich clusters is that they did not loose Fe at variance with the groups or small clusters
having a lower IMLR indicating a loss of baryons Renzini 1997 On the other hand
the Fe ratios can impose constraints on stellar nucleosynthesis IMF dierent roles
of SNe and SN feedback
13 Conclusions on the ICM
The main conclusions on the chemical enrichment of the ICM can be summarized as
follows

cosmological model is m  03   07 and h070
 Good models for the chemical enrichment of the ICM should reproduce at the same
time the Fe ratios inside galaxies and in the ICM They should also reproduce the
 Crucial parameters are SN feedback SN nucleosynthesis IMF and whether all the
stellar ejecta produced over a Hubble time can reach the ICM or remain bound to the
parent galaxy
 Type Ia SNe play a fundamental role in the chemical and energy content evolution
of the ICM
 Good models for the ICM enrichment assuming that the energy transfer from SN
II is  3 and from SNIa is 100 predict an energy per particle in the ICM of Ep  04
keV not enough to break the self- similarity in clusters
