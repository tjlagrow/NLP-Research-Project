ABSTRACT
In the last years more and more interest has been devoted to analytical solutions
including inow and outow to study the metallicity enrichment in galaxies In this
framework we assume a star formation rate which follows a linear Schmidt law and
we present new analytical solutions for the evolution of the metallicity Z in galaxies
In particular we take into account environmental eects including primordial and
enriched gas infall outow dierent star formation eciencies and galactic fountains
The enriched infall is included to take into account galaxy-galaxy interactions Our
main results can be summarized as i when a linear Schmidt law of star formation
is assumed the resulting time evolution of the metallicity Z is the same either for a
closed-box model or for an outow model ii The mass-metallicity relation for galaxies
which suer a chemically enriched infall originating from another evolved galaxy with
no pre-enriched gas is shifted down in parallel at lower Z values if compared the
closed box model iii When a galaxy suers at the same time a primordial infall
and a chemically enriched one the primordial infall always dominates the chemical
evolution iv We present new solutions for the metallicity evolution in a galaxy which
suers galactic fountains and an enriched infall from another galaxy at the same
time The analytical solutions presented here can be very important to study the
metallicity oxygen which is measured in high-redshift objects These solutions can
be very useful a in the context of cosmological semi-analytical models for galaxy
formation and evolution and b for the study of compact groups of galaxies
Key words galaxies abundances - galaxies evolution - galaxies ISM
INTRODUCTION
The galactic chemical evolution is the study of the trans-
formation of gas into stars and the resulting evolution of
the chemical composition of a galaxy The so called Sim-
ple Model remains an useful guide for understanding the
chemical evolution of galaxies since the pioneering works of
Schmidt 1963 Searle  Sargent 1972 Tinsley 1974
Pagel  Patchett 1975 In order to derive analytical so-
lutions for the chemical evolution of galaxies one needs to
make several hypotheses the initial mass function IMF
should be considered constant the lifetime of stars should
be neglected  instantaneous recycling approximation IRA
and the complete mixing of chemical elements with the sur-
rounding interstellar medium ISM These assumptions in
fact allow us to have analytical expressions for the metallic-
ity evolution of the galaxies in time and in terms of the gas
fraction One can nd analytical solutions even in presence
of gas ows infall outow galactic fountains as shown

However in all mentioned works the solutions are ob-
tained only under specic assumptions regarding the in-
falloutow rates However we note that analytical solutions
are not able to give a complete description of the chemistry
of a galaxy since they fail in following the evolution of el-
ements created on long time-scales such as iron and nitro-
gen A satisfactory description of the iron evolution requires
detailed numerical models relaxing IRA and including the
chemical enrichment from Type Ia SNe eg Matteucci 
Greggio 1986 allow one to follow in detail the evolution of
single elements Matteucci  Greggio 1986 showed in de-
tail the eect of the time-delay model already suggested by
Tinsley 1980 and Greggio  Renzini 1983 in particular

abundance ratios involving -elements O Mg Si Analyt-

ing the evolution of oxygen created on short timescales and
tracing the evolution of the global metallicity Z of which
oxygen is the main component
In this work we start by using the formalism described
by Matteucci 2001 Recchi et al 2008 and Spitoni et al
2010 and we show for the rst time the analytical solution
of the evolution of the metallicity of a galaxy in presence of
environment eects coupled with galactic fountains and
primordial infall of gas In this context for environment
eect we mean the situation where a galaxy suers during
its evolution infall of enriched gas from another evolving
galactic system and this gas represents an enriched infall
variable in time
The dynamics of interacting systems have been the
subject of many papers concerning numerical simula-
tions Toomre  Toomre 1972 Barnes  Hernquist 1992
Berentzen et al 2003 and spectrophotometric models Lar-
son  Tinsley 1978 Kennicutt 1990 Temporin et al 2003a
2003b Large amounts of ISM can be removed from the
main disks of spiral galaxies by dierent processes tides due
to the gravitational force of a companion ram pressure strip-
ping during a near head-on collision between gas-rich galax-
ies ram pressure stripping by intracluster gas and galactic
winds driven by supernovae Smith  Struck 2001 using
CO signatures observed 11 extragalactic tails and bridges
in nine interacting galaxy systems Recently Smith et al
2010 using Galaxy Evolution Explorer GALEX ultravio-
let telescope studied star formation morphology and stellar
populations and in 42 nearby optically selected pre-merger
interacting galaxy pairs Tails and bridges structures are of-
ten more prominent relative to the disks in UV images com-
pared to optical maps This eect is likely due to enhanced
star formation in the tidal features compared to the disks
rather than to reduced extinction We also refer the reader
to the review of Boselli  Gavazzi 2006 where a compre-
hensive description of the environment eects on late-type
galaxies in nearby clusters is presented Among them we re-
call the tidal interactions among galaxy pairs which act on
gas dust and stars as well as on dark matter and is depend-
ing on the gravitational bounding of the various components
tidal interaction between galaxies and the cluster potential
well and nally the so-called galaxy harassment the evo-
lution of cluster galaxies is governed by the combined eect
of multiple high speed galaxy-galaxy close  50 kpc en-
counters with the interaction with the potential well of the
cluster as a whole
As stated by Davies et al 2010 galaxy-galaxy inter-
actions are particularly important and striking when the
speed of the interaction is well matched to the velocities
of the stars and gas Therefore small galaxy groups can po-
tentially provide the environment for dramatic gravitational
disturbances Beyond the Local Group the closest example
of this is the environment around M81 the M81 group In
fact in M81 group it is evident that various galaxies are
connected by ows Extended lamentary structures exter-
nal to the disc of M81 are clearly seen in emission in all of
the Herschel bands These complex interactions cannot be
described by the simple tools oered for example by Rec-
chi et al 2008 or similar papers in literature and with this
paper we provide a new set of analytical solutions to take
into account this kind of interactions in the framework of
analytical chemical evolution models
Moreover an enriched infall of gas can be originated
from the galaxy itself In fact in the galactic fountain mod-
els Shapiro  Field 1976 Houck  Bregman 1990 hot
gas is ejected out of the Galactic disk by supernova SN
explosions and part of this gas falls back in the form of
condensed neutral clouds which move at intermediate and
high radial velocities For example in the galactic fountain
model the ejected gas from SN events falls back ballistically
Bregman 1980 These models are able to explain the ver-
tical motion of the cold and warm gas components observed
in several spiral galaxies eg Fraternali et al 2004 Boosma
et al 2005 Following the analytical implementation of the
galactic fountain presented by Recchi et al 2008 we will
consider such an eect in our new analytical solutions
In the context of cosmological semi-analytical models of
galaxy formation and evolution each galaxy is treated as one
unresolved object using integrated properties to describe
the mass of stars cold gas hot gas and the black hole Since
each component of the galaxy is represented by one number
the dynamics within the galaxy is not resolved and one
needs to assume with laws for star formation cooling and
feedback that are valid on average for the entire galaxy In
this context our new analytical solutions shall be extremely
useful because they give simple recipes concerning the time
evolution of the global metallicity of a galaxy in dierent
situations including inow and outow
The paper is organized as follows in Sect 2 we present
the main assumptions of the analytical chemical evolu-
tion models in Sect 3 we describe our assumptions and the
system of equation we need to solve and in Sect 4 new an-
alytical solutions are presented Finally our conclusions are
summarized in Section 5 In Appendix A we draw the com-
plete expressions of some new analytical solutions we pre-
sented in this paper and in Appendix B a list of variables
and parameters used throughout the paper is reported

The main assumptions of the Simple Model Tinsley 1980
i The IMF is constant in time
ii The gas is well mixed at any time instantaneous mix-
ing approximation
iii Stars  1 M die instantaneously stars smaller than
1 M live forever instantaneous recycling approximation or
These simplifying assumptions allow us to calculate analyt-
ically the chemical evolution of the galaxies once we have
dened the fundamental quantities such as the returned
fraction
R  Z 
m  MRmdm
where m is the IMF and MR is the mass of the remnant
and the yield per stellar generation

mpZmmdm
ccid13 xxxx RAS MNRAS 000 1
where pZm is the fraction of newly produced and ejected
metals by a star of mass m
Recently Recchi  Kroupa 2015 applied the inte-
grated galactic initial mass function IGIMF to the sim-
ple model solution and yZ and R are not constant but are
functions of timethrough the time dependence of the star
formation rate SFR and the metallicity of the system
The well known solution of the so called closed-box
where the system is one-zone and there are no inows nor
outows with constant mass gas plus stars is
Z  yZ ln1
where  is the gas fraction MgasMtot with Mtot  M 
Mgas It is also assumed that the Mgas0  Mtot0 and
the initial metallicity of the system is zero
Analytical solutions of simple models of chemical evo-
lution including infall or outow are known since at least 30
years Pagel  Patchett 1975 Hartwick 1976 Clayton 1988
Twarog 1980 Edmunds 1990 Here we follow the approach
and the terminology of Matteucci 2001 where it was as-
sumed for simplicity linear ows  gas ows are proportional
to the SFR Therefore the outow rate W t is dened as
W t  1  Rt
where t is the SFR and the infall rate At is given by
At  1  Rt
Here  and  are two proportionality constants  0 The
rst assumption is justied by the fact that the larger the
SFR is the more intense are the energetic events associated
with it in particular supernova explosions and stellar winds
and therefore the larger is the chance of having a large-scale
outow see eg Silk 2003 A proportionality between At
and t has been discussed by Recchi et al 2008 They
tested dierent prescriptions for the infall of gas showing
that their results do not change substantially if a generic ex-
ponential infall is assumed This demonstrates also that the
major source of error in the solutions of the simple models
is the IRA assumption rather than the assumption of linear
ows
In Lilly et al 2013 and Pipino et al 2014 they con-
sidered the simple chemical evolution model in the cosmo-
logical context where the gas accreted is proportional to the
dark matter growth In particular in Pipino et al 2014
the infall parameter t is time dependent and is dened
as the ratio between the accretion rate from cosmological
simulations and the SFR In this paper we do not inves-
tigate cosmological aspects but we study the eects of
galaxy-galaxy interactions on the time evolution of galactic
metallicity

tion of  in the case with only outows ie At  0 and

3 THE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODEL
WITH ENVIRONMENT EFFECTS
Using the formalism introduced by Matteucci 2001 and
adopted later by Recchi et al 2008 and Spitoni et al
2010 for the rst time we intend to study the eects of
the environment on the chemical evolution of a galaxy by
means of analytical solutions The environment eects are
mimicked by an infall of gas with a time dependent metal-
licity originated by a nearby galaxy
In our model we analyze the evolution of the oxygen in
a generic galaxy and assume for the oxygen yield standard
values of yO  001 and the returned fraction R  025 As
done in Spitoni et al 2010 those values were obtained by
adopting the Salpeter 1955 IMF and the stellar yields of
Woosley  Weaver 1995 for oxygen at solar metallicity
31 Our model for a system formed by two
isolated galaxies
We consider the chemical evolution of the galaxy1 with ini-
tial mass Mtot10  Mg10 We study here the eects of
the interaction with another galaxy on the abundance of
oxygen ZO1t  MO1tMg1t
We assume an environment dependent infall originated
by feedback episodes and galaxy-galaxy interactions We as-
sume that the infall is proportional to the gas outows from
nearby galaxies with wind parameter  First we consider
the case with the enriched infall proportional to the SFR
of the galaxy2
A1t  W2t  1  R2t
where 2t is the SFR of the galaxy2 and  is the frac-
tion of outowing gas from galaxy2 which reaches galaxy1
We assume in this work that   05 In fact the outows
are generally bipolar and for a lobe approaching galaxy 1
the second lobe moves away from it The value 05 is an
upper limit for the fraction of outowing gas from galaxy2
to galaxy1 Only if the outow is well collimated along a
narrow solid angle and only if galaxy1 happens to intercept
this galactic wind  can be equal to 05 For example from
GALEX UV images of the starbust galaxy M81 given by
Hoopes et al 2005 it can be seen that the opening angle
of the northern side wind is around 55 degrees
The ZO2t metallicity of the infall is time and depends
on the outows of the galaxy2
The system of equations we have to solve for our galaxy1
is the following 


 1  R2t
dt  1  Rcid02t  1tcid1
dt  1  Rcid01tcid2yO  ZO1tcid3  2tZO2tcid1
E Spitoni
where 1t is the SFR of the galaxy1
As mentioned above ZO2t is the metallicity of the
galaxy2 which is suering only gas outows We therefore
need to solve another system of equations for the evolution
of ZO2t in galaxy2
Recalling Matteucci 2001 the system to be solved for
galaxy2 with only outow of gas is


 1  R2t
dt    11  R2t
dt  1  R2tcid2  ZO2t  yO  ZO2tcid3
We recall that the outow rate for the galaxy2 is W2t 
A2t
 With equations 10 and 11 we study an isolated
system formed by two galaxies when   1 In fact in this
case we have that dMtot2
dt  dMtot1
dt  0
On the other hand imposing  6 1 we assume that part
of the chemical enriched gas escaping from galaxy2 ends up
in the in intergalactic medium IGM
32 Model including primordial infall of gas and
the interactions of 2 galaxies
The majority of detailed chemical evolution models of galac-
tic systems assumes that the galaxies formed by accretion of
primordial gas from the IGM Therefore we examine here
also the more realistic case where both galaxy1 and galaxy2
suer an inow of primordial gas We assume that the in-
fall rate is proportional of the SFR of the galactic system
as discussed in Section 21 Hence for the galaxy1 the pri-
mordial infall rate is A1t  1  R1t whereas is
A2t  1  R2t for the galaxy2 The systems of
equation we need to solve are the following ones

4 THE NEW ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS
In this Section we present our new analytical solutions First
we discuss the case where the galaxy1 suers an enriched
infall from an evolving companion galaxy galaxy2 In the
following we generalize this solution in the case of dierent
SFEs for the galaxy1 and galaxy2 We also present the case
where a primordial infall is taken into account The last re-
sult is related to environment eects coupled with galactic
fountains
From the system 11 with the initial condition that
Mtot20  Mg20 we have that
Mtot2t 
Mg2t  Mg20cid161

Finally inserting eq 18 in eq 17 we recover the following
time dependent expression for 1

sume 04 05 S1 Gyr1 The magenta short dashed line

for Mg10Mg201 the solid blue line represents the case with
Mg10Mg2005 The long dashed grey line is the closed-box
solution with the same initial metallicity Right panel Same of

represents the model with 05 the case with 04 is reported
with the dotted green line the short dashed magenta line is the
case with 03 The models with 02 and 01 are in brown
dashed dotted line and violet long dashed dotted line respec-
tively The long dashed grey line is the closed-box solution with
the same initial metallicity ZO1001
It is worth noting that the evolution in time of ZO2t
does not depend on  in the specic case of the Schmidt
1959 SFR with k1 and is the same as in the closed-box
one In fact for a closed-box model with the linear Schmidt
1959 law we have this expression for the gas mass Mgt 
Mg0e1RSt Following eq 3 we derive the expression
of the metallicity Zcb as a function of time for the closed-box
cb Therefore we have that
Zcbt  yO lncid0e1RStcid1  yO1  RSt
In Fig 1 we draw the evolution of the metallicity ZO
as function of the gas fraction  for both closed-box model
and the one with linear outows in the case of the linear
Schmidt 1959 law   SMg with wind parameter 2
and S1 Gyr1 Horizontal lines indicate dierent galactic
times during the galactic histories
Even if the closed-box model and the model with only
outow have the same metallicity in time that same metal-
licity is reached for dierent values of the gas fraction 
The metallicity ZO2t expressed in eq 20 can
be inserted in the system 10 and recalling that
 the third equation of the system 10
dt  dMg1ZO1t
can be rewritten as
dZO1t
 1  R
cid01tyO  2tcid2  ZO1t  ZO2tcid3cid1
ccid13 xxxx RAS MNRAS 000 1
Hence we assume that the SFR follows a Schmidt 1959
law 1  S  Mg1 and 2  S  Mg2 and the dierential
equation we need to solve when we include eq 20 in eq
22 is
dZO1t

cid16yO 
Mg1tcid2  ZO1t  yO1  RStcid3cid17
The nal expression for ZO1t in a case where the
galaxy1 is aected by the interaction with another galactic
system galaxy2 and with ZO20  0 is the following one
ZO1t  SyO1  Rt 
ZO10
1   Mg20
Mg10cid161  e1RStcid17
We see that the closed-box solution is still recovered
when the initial metallicity ZO10 for the galaxy1 is con-
sidered equal to zero The reason for this behaviour is that
the outow from galaxy2 has the same metallicity of the
whole galaxy ie it is expressed by eq 20 Since the two
expressions eqs 20 and 21 are identical and since metallic-
ity is not an additive quantitiy the expression ZO1t in eq
24 is expected In Fig 2 we show the time evolution of the
metallicity oxygen where we assume an initial metallicity
dierent from zero in the galaxy1 and as function of dier-
ent Mg10Mg20 ratios 2 1 and 05 We considering two
dierent initial metallicities ZO10005 left panel and
E Spitoni
ZO1001 right panel We are aware that these values
are extremely large but here we only like to show the trends
of considering dierent pre-enriched values We see that at
early times the dilution eect is prominent because the in-
falling gas has a much lower metallicity of that galaxy1 and
as expected the lower the ratio Mg10Mg20 is more the
dilution eect is important
In Fig 3 the eects of the fraction of outowing gas
 on the time evolution of the galaxy1 oxygen abundance
obtained by eq 24 are shown Assuming ZO1t01
Mg10Mg201 04 and S 1 Gyr1 we present
dierent models varying    05 04 03 02 01 As ex-
pected the dilution eect is larger assuming higher  values
We discuss now the case where the initial metallicity
for galaxy1 and galaxy2 are ZO100 ZO20 6 0 re-
spectively In this case the dierential equation we need to
solve is

In Fig 4 we show the evolution of the oxygen abundance
of galaxy1 using the new analytical solution presented in
eq 26 with 04 05 and ZO100 considering two
dierent initial metallicities ZO20005 and ZO2001
In this case we use such high values for the pre-enrichment
in order to better visualize the general trends and the eects
of dierent Mg10Mg20 ratios As expected at variance
with Fig 2 the smaller is the Mg10Mg20 ratios the less
ecient the chemical evolution is for galaxy1
Overall the general solution for the evolution of the
oxygen abundance for the galaxy1 with both initial metal-
licities ZO10 ZO20 dierent from zero is given by the
following expression
ZO1t  SyO1  Rt

42 Some applications to real cases
The evolution of the stellar mass content in the galaxy1
M1t can be simply inferred by the relation M1t 
Mtot1t  Mg1t The time evolution of the total mass of
galaxy1 Mtot1t is given by the rst equation of system
10 and with the initial condition Mtot10  Mg10 we
have that
ZO10  ZO20 Mg20
Mg10cid161  e1RStcid17

Mg10cid161  e1RStcid17
The general solution reported in eq 27 describes the more
realistic scenario where galaxies exhibit dierent chemical
enrichment rates and therefore they posses dierent metal-
licity when the interaction starts It seems plausible that
galaxy2 presents a faster chemical enrichment in systems as
the M81 group where large and metal rich galaxies M81
M82 and NGC3077 interact and eject gas In other envi-
ronments it can be more reasonable that only dwarf galaxies
would show galactic winds and therefore in this situation
galaxy2 is less chemically enriched than galaxy1 In con-
clusion both cases ZO20ZO10 and ZO20ZO10
have physical meaning Recently in Recchi et al 2015 it
was shown that the values of initial metallicities depend on
the level of the interaction between galaxies

In Fig

evolution of
logOH12 as function of stellar mass for the closed-box
model with a model where environment eects are taken
into account The logOH12 quantity is recovered from
ZO1t using the following expression logcid16ZO1t16 
075cid1712 where 075 is the assumed fraction of hydrogen
The assumed initial mass in each model is 1010 M In the
last case at a xed stellar mass value the system shows a
smaller oxygen abundance compared to the closed-box evo-
lution
In Fig 6 we study the eects of the environment on
the mass-metallicity MZ relation by comparing with the
observed relation of Kewley  Ellison 2008 for Sloan Digit
Sky Survey SDSS star-forming galaxies To estimate the
amount of gas that resides in each star-forming galaxy and

Figure 6 The observed mass-metallicity relation and related
standard deviation of Kewley  Ellison 2008 are indicated with
the dotted grey lines With the green circles we show the closed-
box results for galaxies with total masses 88108 5109 1010
51010 1011 M respectively We compare them with model re-
sults where we consider the interactions with a companion galaxy
with the same initial masses For all the models it is assumed that
the initial oxygen abundances are ZO10ZO200 With the
magenta hexagon models with the wind parameter xed at the
value of   01 are presented The cases with   05   2
and   6 are represented with blue pentagons red squares and
brown triangles respectively
The closed box model is not able to reproduce the ob-
served MZ relation and in Spitoni et al 2010 we concluded
that a galactic wind rate increasing with decreasing galac-
tic mass or a variable IMF are both viable solutions for
reproducing the MZ relation We consider also galactic sys-
tems with the same initial masses of the closed-box models
but taking into account environment eects an enriched in-
fall from a galaxy with the same mass and with the same
SFE with zero initial metallicities for galaxy1 and galaxy2
ZO10ZO200
In Fig 6 we show the results when we consider four
dierent inow parameters 01 05 2 6 We see that at a
xed stellar mass the metallicity of the galactic system drops
down in presence of inow We are in agreement with the
work of Torrey et al 2012 where the eects of dynamical
interaction of companion galaxies were studied In Spitoni
et al 2010 we have already proved that a combination of
primordial infall and outows with variable wind parameters
as functions of the stellar mass is required to reproduce it
Here we show the eects of this interaction compared to the
closed-box case
In Torrey et al 2012 galaxy-galaxy interactions do not
change the slope of the MZ but the MZ is just shifted down
in parallel at smaller metallicities In our case if we con-
sider a constant  in Fig 6 connecting the same type and
colour points for all the galaxy masses we have a atten-

model of the abundance logOH12 as a function of the stellar
mass M for the closed-box model for a galaxy with total mass
equal to 1010 M is drawn with the dotted green line With the
solid blue line we show the results for the galaxy1 with a initial
mass of 1010 M and when we take into account the enriched
infall from a companion galaxy with the same initial mass and
the wind parameter equal to 2 and 05 The initial oxygen
abundances are ZO10ZO200
the gas fraction  as a function of the galactic stellar mass
we use the method described in Spitoni et al 2010
We determine the cold gas mass of each galaxy on the
basis of its SFR using the following inverted Kennicutt
1998 relation which links the gas surface density to the
SFR per unit area

M pc2
where the gas density gas is expressed in M pc2 and
the SFR surface density  in M yr1 kpc2 The gas mass
Mgas in M is given by
Mgas  gas  2R2
where Rd is the scaling radius calculated as in Mo et al
1998 At this point we have a relation between  and the
stellar mass for each considered galaxy
First we follow the evolution of the closed box mod-
els with zero initial metallicity for dierent initial masses

and 1011 M respectively For each model we compute the
time evolution of ZOt t and Mt Thus we con-
sider the time tM Z where the stellar mass MtM Z and
the corresponding  belong to the t reported in Fig 2
of Spitoni et al 2010 At this point the metallicity at
the time tM Z is computed using eq 21 In Fig 6 we

the dotted grey lines With the green circles we show the closed-
box with the variable yO values of Spitoni et al 2010 for galaxies

ing of the MZ slope compared to the closed-box However
from Spitoni et al 2010 we know that more massive galac-
tic systems are associated to smaller outow episodes and
therefore smaller wind parameters Hence if we consider a
variable  decreasing towards higher mass galaxies we pre-
serve the slope of the MZ relation
Our results are also in agreement with the observed
depression of 005 -010 dex found by Ellison et al 2008
for the MZ relation in interacting galaxies if we consider a
variable wind parameter  with a maximum value smaller
than 6
In Fig 7 we show the MZ relation obtained by the
closed-box models with the same prescriptions adopted in
1 of Spitoni et al
Fig 6 but with the variable yields yO
2010 which is able to perfectly reproduce the MZ relation
Again the fact of considering environment eects leads
to a drop in the metallicity of the galaxy1 at a xed stellar
mass compared to the closed-box models The t with the
observations deviates for   01 and this might be a hint
that the kind of interactions treated in this paper cannot be
very general but it surely applies for specic systems such
as the M81 group
Finally in Fig 8 we show the eects of dierent ini-
tial metallicities ZO20 of galaxy2 on the MZ relation
Assuming the same model parameters of Fig 6 but with
ZO20  5  103 we see that at a xed stellar mass the

decrease of the metallicity is less prominent compared Fig
6 especially for small stellar masses
Edmunds 1990 studied the eects of gas ows on the
chemical evolution of galaxies showing that it does exist a
forbidden area in the plane log1 versus metallicity above
the simple model solution for models with inow of unen-
riched gas or outows Here we want to test if this result
is still valid in the case of a time dependent enriched in-
fall from a companion galaxy with initial metallicities for
galaxy1 and galaxy2 set to zero ZO20  ZO100 The

Mg10cid21  e1RStcid3cid1

Mg10cid01  e1RStcid1
We need an expression for 1t as a function of the metal-
licity ZO We have seen that the solution ZO1t in the case
of zero initial metallicity is 1  RSyot Therefore we can
rewrite eq 31 as

In Fig 9 we show the metallicity ZO1 in case of en-
riched infall from the evolution of galaxy2 as the function
of ln1 We x 05 2 and consider dierent ra-
tio Mg10Mg20 values1 01 001 We see that all the
studied cases are in the forbidden area dened by Edmunds
1990 and they evolve similarly to the closed box model
with small dierences This result at variance with Ed-
munds 1990 is due to the fact that here is the rst time in
which these particular cases are studied and the theorems
T2 and T3 of Edmunds 1990 cannot be applied because
of the presence of enriched infall
43 The analytical solution including both
galactic fountain and environment eects
In Recchi et al 2008 new analytical solutions in the frame-
work of dierential winds were presented namely galactic
winds in which the metals are ejected out of the parent
galaxy more eciently than the other elements The exis-
tence of dierential winds has been rst introduced in the
context of chemical evolution of galaxies by Pilyugin 1993
and Marconi et al 1994 A realistic case of variable in-
fall metallicity is represented by the situation in which the
metallicity of the infalling gas is set to be always equal to
the one of the galactic wind This condition implies that the
very same gas that has been driven out of the galaxy by en-
ergetic events can subsequently fall back to the galaxy due
to the gravitational potential well
This kind of duty cycle is called galactic fountain
Shapiro  Field 1976 Bregman 1980 Spitoni et al 2008
2009 showed the eect of galactic fountains on a detailed
chemical evolution model where the instantaneous recycling
and mixing approximation were relaxed of the Milky Way
They discussed the delay in the chemical enrichment due to
the fact that the gas takes a nite time to orbit around the
Galaxy an fall back into the disk In Recchi et al 2008
an analytical solution was presented in the case for galactic
fountains
New chemical evolution analytical solutions

infall with the parameter  is drawn with the yellow arrow The

We are studying galactic fountain eects in the framework
of dierential winds as done in Recchi et al 2008 where it
was introduced the parameter   1  in order to take into
account for the fact that metals are more easily channeled
out from the parent galaxy compared to the unprocessed
In Fig 10 we present a sketch of the gas ow patterns
for the galaxy1 when galactic fountain are considered It is
shown the gas inow from the galaxy 2 with the associated
wind parameter  the outow from galaxy1  and the
fraction which comes back 
Melioli et al 2015 using three-dimensional hydrody-
namical simulations investigated the impact of SN feedback
in gas rich dwarf galaxies and the formation of galactic foun-
tain and outows They found a similar circulation ow of
the one presented in Fig 10 galactic fountains is generally
established and the metal-rich SN ejecta is instead more sig-
nicant fraction 25-80 percent is vented in the intergalactic
medium even
It must be underlined that the treatment of the galactic
fountains is actually analogous to what is done in Recchi
et al 2008 with  replacing  and  replacing  The
dierence is in the role of galaxy2
The system of equations we have to solve for the galaxy1
is the following

dt  1  Rcid01tcid2yO  ZO1tcid3  2tZO2tcid1

The dierential equation of the metallicity in terms of
oxygen for the system is

In Fig 11 the eects of dierent values of the param-
eter  are tested The higher  is the less the galaxy gets
enriched This is because we assumed that    and con-

sequently the metals in this case oxygen which escape are
larger than the ones which rain back into the galaxy

Finally we test the case where the interacting galaxies have
dierent SFEs It is well known that dierent galactic sys-
tems can be characterized by dierent SFEs Matteucci
2001 and generally higher SFEs can be associated to more
massive systems Here we show the new analytical solution
for the galaxy1 with a SFE S1 receiving enriched outow of
gas from another galaxy associated with a SFE S2 There-
fore with the new SFRs 1  S1  Mg1 and 2  S2  Mg2

cid26Mg10cid16S1    1S2cid17  Mg20S2cid0et  1cid1cid27
with   1  RS1    1S2 It is trivial to see that
when S1  S2 eq 38 is identical to eq 15 The dierential
equation we have to solve to have the metallicity evolution
of the galaxy1 in presence of dierent SFEs is

We note that the result depends on the ratio between
the initial masses of galaxy1 and galaxy2 Moreover as ex-
pected when we impose S1  S2 in eq 40 the resulting
ZO1t is identical to the one obtained with eq 24 In Fig

galaxy2 when we consider the same initial gas mass ratio

all models
We obtain as expected that smaller values of S2 lead to
a smaller chemical enrichment of the system In the case of
S2 01 Gyr1 the metallicity of the system even decreases
at later galactic times due to the strong dilution eect of

with 09 is drawn with the dotted green line With the solid

gas because of as expected the small SFE value of galaxy2
compared to galaxy1
In Fig 13 xing S1 and S2 at the constant values of
1 and 01 Gyr1 respectively we show the eect of dier-
ent initial gas mass ratios for the galaxy1 and galaxy2 We
consider four cases Mg10Mg20 103 102 1 and 101
Because of the choice of an extremely low SFE for galaxy2 we
expect that the most important deviation from the closed-
box solution is obtained with larger Mg20 values hence
smaller Mg10Mg20 ratios In Fig 13 we conrm it and
the model with Mg10Mg20 103 is almost identical to
the closed-box evolution model
45 The eects of the primordial infall
We present here the results in the presence of a primordial
infall of gas for both galaxy1 and galaxy2 First we need to
compute the time evolution for the metallicity ZO2t when
a primordial infall of gas is considered To this aim we need
the expression of the mass fraction 2t as a function of
time From the system 13 with the condition that the total
initial mass is equal to the gas content Mtot20  Mg20
we have that

Figure 15 We show the time evolution of the metallicity ZO1
when we consider dierent SFEs S2 for the galaxy2 coupled with
a primordial infall of gas following the new analytical solution
presented in eq A2 of Appendix A We consider the case when
Mg10Mg201 and 05 and the SFE fro the galaxy1 is
xed at the value of S11 Gyr1  All the models assume 03
and 07 The initial oxygen abundances for the galaxy1 and
galaxy2 are ZO10ZO200 The model with S22 Gyr1
is represented by the magenta dotted line the model with S21
Gyr1 is drawn with the blue solid line the model with S202
Gyr1 is drawn with the green short dashed line Finally the
model with S201 Gyr1 is drawn with the grey long dashed
We recall that the general solution as function of the gas
fraction for a system with primordial infall and outow is
given by eq 8 with ZA  0 Finally if we insert eq 44
in eq 8 we obtain that
 cid01  e1RStcid1 
The new expressions for the time evolution of Mg1t and
Mg2t are respectively
Mg1t  e11RStcid26Mg10Mg20cid21e1RStcid3cid27 46

It is easy to show that it is possible to recover the solution of
eq 24 presented in Section 41 for lim0 ZO1t In Fig
14 we show the time evolution of the metallicity ZO1 when
Mg10Mg201 05 and the SFE for the galaxy1 and
galaxy2 are xed at the value S1 Gyr1  Assuming for all
the models 03 we test dierent values for the the infall
parameter  which is associated with the primordial infall
05 07 09 15
We note that the eect of dilution of a primordial gas
infall overwhelms the enriched infall from the companion
galaxy and the time evolution of the metallicity for the
galaxy1 deviates substantially from the closed-box solution
we have proved in previous Sections that the evolution in
time of a system with only enriched gas from a compan-
ion galaxy follows the closed-box solution even with a pri-
mordial infall parameter comparable to the one of enriched
infall
We also consider the case with dierent SFEs for the
galaxy1 and galaxy2 in presence of primordial infall We do
not enter into details about the procedures and the relations
used to recover the new analytical solution ZO1t  and we
only show the solution in eqA2 of Appendix A
In Fig 15 we show the eects of dierent values for
SFEs of the galaxy2 on the chemical evolution of galaxy1 in
presence of primordial infall We consider the case when the
mass ratio is Mg10Mg201 and 05 and the SFE
for the galaxy1 is xed at the value of S1  1 Gyr1  All
the models assume 03 and 07 We consider dierent
models with dierent S2 values 21 02 01 Gyr1 In Fig
15 it is clearly shown that all the models with dierent SFEs
show more or less the same time evolution for the ZO1
Comparing the models with S202 Gyr1 and S201
Gyr1 we note that at late times as expected the chemical
evolution of galaxy1 which suers the enriched infall from
galaxy2 with S202 shows a higher metallicity This be-
havior is inverted at early times This is due to the way in
which we consider the primordial infall In fact as shown in
eq 5 the primordial infall is assumed to be proportional to
the SFR of the galaxy therefore at early times the galaxy2
with S202 Gyr1 suers a larger dilution eect than the
same system with S201 Gyr1
We conclude that in presence of primordial infall the
chemically enriched gas coming from galaxy2 has not a big
eect on the chemical evolution of the galaxy1
In this work we consider only primordial infall from the
IGM whereas in Peng  Maiolino 2014b it was studied
how global environment properties overdensity of galax-
ies can modify the metallicity of the IGM The observed
strong correlation between over-density and metallicity for
star-forming satellites suggests that the gas infall is getting
progressively more metal-enriched in dense regions

In this paper we presented new analytical solutions for the
evolution of the metallicity oxygen of a galaxy in pres-
ence of environment eects coupled with galactic foun-
tains and primordial infall of gas The main results of our
study are the following ones
 If we consider a linear Schmidt 1959 law for the star
formation rate we have the same time evolution of the metal-
licity for both the closed-box model and the one with only
outow Therefore in the last case the result does not de-
pend on the wind parameter  This result is holding when
the outow is not dierential It is worth to note that even if
at the same time those two systems show the same content
of metals they show dierent gas fractions as shown in Fig
 The new analytical solution for the evolution of the
galaxy1 where we consider the enriched inow of gas from
the galaxy2 with initial metallicities ZO10 galaxy1 and
ZO20 galaxy2 is
ZO1t  SyO1  Rt
where  is the wind parameter  is the fraction of the out-
owing gas from galaxy2 to galaxy1 S is the star formation
eciency and Mg20
is the ratio between the initial gas
masses of the two galaxies
 When we consider the time evolution of a galaxy in-
cluding an enriched infall due to the interactions with a
nearby galaxy assuming no pre-enriched gas for both galax-
ies the chemical enrichemnt is less ecient than in the
closed-box solution at a xed stellar mass Moreover the
mass-metallicity relation for galaxies which suer a gas in-
fall from an evolving galaxy is shifted down at lower Z val-
ues if compared to the closed-box model results for isolated
galaxies
 We show a new analytical solution where we consider
galactic fountain eects in the framework of dierential
winds coupled with the interaction with a nearby galaxy
 We presented the new solution in case of dierent SFEs
If the infall gas originated by a nearby galaxy has a smaller
SFE than the galaxy suering the infall the recipient galaxy
will show a less ecient chemical enrichment In this case we
showed that the smaller is the ratio between the initial gas
masses of the recipient and donor galaxy the less ecient
the chemical evolution is
 A new analytical solution when a primordial infall is
coupled with interactions with a nearby galaxy is presented
The eect of dilution of a primordial gas infall overwhelms
the enriched infall from the chemical evolution of a compan-
ion galaxy even with a primordial infall parameter compa-
rable to the one of enriched infall We have also shown how
dierent SFEs for the companion galaxy does not aect the
chemical evolution of galaxy1 in presence of primordial in-

New chemical evolution analytical solutions
APPENDIX A NEW ANALYTICAL SOLUTIONS WITH GALACTIC FOUNTAINS AND
PRIMORDIAL INFALL
 We report here the analytical solution for the time evolution of the oxygen abundance ZO1 when galactic fountain and
the enriched infall of gas from a companion galaxy are taken into account This solution is obtained when the initial metallicity
of the galaxy1 is assumed equal to zero
