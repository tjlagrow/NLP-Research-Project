Abstract The star-formation histories of the main stellar components of the Milky Way con-
strain critical aspects of galaxy formation and evolution I discuss recent determinations of such
histories together with their interpretation in terms of theories of disk galaxy evolution
Keywords Galaxy disk Galaxy evolution Galaxy stellar content
1 Context Disk galaxy formation and evolution
The Milky Way appears to be a typical disk Galaxy albeit the one for which we can
obtain the most detailed information for the largest samples of tracer objects I will
mostly discuss samples of stars The star-formation histories of the main stellar compo-
nents of the Milky Way constrain critical aspects of disk galaxy formation and evolution
These include aspects of the merger history such as what merged with the Milky Way
and when did it merge and also the epoch at which extended disks started to form
These in turn depend upon the nature of dark matter possible feedback mechanisms
once stars start to form and the amplitudes onset and duration and signs of gas ows
Much observational evidence in particular from large-scale structure such as the spec-
trum of uctuations in the cosmic microwave background and the statistics of massive
galaxy clusters has led to a concordance cosmological model wherein the recent since
a redshift of  1 rate of overall expansion of the Universe is driven by Dark Energy
and the matter content of the Universe is predominantly non-baryonic Cold Dark Matter
eg Spergel et al 2007 The primordial power spectrum of Cold Dark Matter CDM
has most power on small scales resulting in a hierarchical sequence of structure forma-
tion whereby small scales form rst then subsequently merge to form larger systems
This concordance model will be referred to below as CDM
While baryons are a minor constituent of such a CDM Universe contributing less
than 3 of the energy density at the present day they are of course how we trace
most of the mass in the Universe The baryonic physics of gaseous dissipational cooling
and subsequent star formation is much more dicult to model than is the Newtonian
gravity that is the only force of signicance for dissipationless CDM The most detailed
simulations of the formation and evolution of an analog of the present-day Milky Way
have therefore been purely N-body with gravity the only force and all matter being
CDM The state-of-the art in October 2008 is illustrated by the Via Lactae II simulation
Diemand et al 2008 This simulation follows the formation of the dark halo of a model
Milky Way Galaxy with initial conditions selected from a larger simulation to ensure
that there will be no major merger after a redshift of 17 a look-back time of somewhat
less than 10 Gyr  as we discuss below this restriction on the merger history is to prevent
destruction of the thin disk within the lifetime of old stars presently observed in the local
Rosemary FG Wyse
A striking feature of this very high-resolution simulation is the persistent substructure
even near the analog of the solar circle 97 of subhaloes that are initially identied at
redshift unity still leave a bound remnant at the present epoch Depending on the details
of their mass and density distributions these subhaloes are expected to lead to heating
and fattening of the thin stellar disk eg Hayashi  Chiba 2006
The overall trends of stellar ages in such hierarchical clustering models are illustrated
by the predictions of Abadi et al 2003 who simulated the formation of a disk galaxy
using a hybrid N-body and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code with simple gas-
cooling and star-formation criteria The galaxy that forms is more bulge-dominated than
is the Milky Way reecting the typical active merger history in the CDM cosmogony
and hence the need to pre-select initial conditions to form a Milky Way analog as done
by Diemand et al The model galaxy can be decomposed into spheroid bulgehalo
thick disk and thin disk with these components being distinct in terms of both surface-
brightness proles and kinematics The spheroid is old and was created by major mergers
that disperse the pre-existing disk plus tidal debris from more minor mergers in this
simulation about half by each mechanism The thin disk seen today is mostly stars
that formed in situ after the cessation of merger activity from gas that was accreted
smoothly into the disk plane as it cooled in the dark halo The inner thin-disk formed
faster reecting the shorter accretion times of lower-angular-momentum gas destined
to dissipate into circular orbits in the central regions Mo Mao  White 1998 There
is therefore a gradient in mean stellar age at the present epoch declining from a mass-
weighted age of 6 Gyr close to the center to 3 Gyr in the outer parts The active merging
typical for the CDM cosmogony means that the overall galactic potential is not steady
enough for formation of an extended thin disk until more recently than a look-back time
of  8 Gyr redshifts less than unity A disk can form early then be destroyed but the
early disks are compact due to the low angular-momentum content of their progenitor
gas reected in the inside-out formation of disks eg Scannapieco et al 2009
In the Abadi et al realization the thick disk is predominantly old and the bulk of
it consists not of stars formed in the potential well of the nal galaxy but instead of
stars formed in satellite galaxies that were later accreted with half due to a satellite that
merged  6 Gyr ago while the stars are older than  10 Gyr old The old stars older
than  8 Gyr in the thin disk are also predominantly accreted This of course requires
that the satellite hosts be on high-angular-momentum orbits with periGalacticons within
the disk before their stars are assimilated into the disk Given that the typical initial
orbit of a satellite dark-halo is far from circular this in turn requires that the satellite
halo be rather massive so that dynamical friction can operate to circularize and shrink
the orbit
11 Tracing the merger history
In a merger orbital energy is absorbed into the internal degrees of freedom of the merging
systems heating them A major merger one with approximately equal mass ratio essen-
tially destroys pre-existing disks transforming them into a pressure-supported spheroid
or stellar halo with  1  3 being the limiting mass ratio Cretton et al 2001 The
eects of the accretion of satellites galaxies plus pure dark matter depends on the time
of accretion their initial orbits masses and density proles since these dictate how easily
they are tidally disrupted and to which component their stellar debris will contribute
Minor mergers mass ratios of less than  1  5 of a fairly robust satellite should pu up
an existing thin stellar disk into a thick disk eg Quinn  Goodman 1986 Kazantzidis

The SFH of the Milky Way Galaxy
et al 2008 plus deposit tidal debris from the satellite along its orbit Some fraction of
the stellar mass of the thin disk is also often assumed in semi-analytic models to be
directly added to the bulge after a minor merger Kaumann 1996 de Lucia  Blaizot
2007 Gravitational torques during mergers cause transport of angular momentum re-
sulting in gas being taken into the central regions where after an induced star-burst it
can contribute to the bulge Mihos  Hernquist 1996 Gas ows driven by mergers can
possibly also build-up the bulge by triggering disk instabilities in a fusion of dynamical
and secular mechanisms Bower et al 2006 Dense inner regions of massive satellites
the higher mass meaning dynamical friction timescales are shorter could also contribute
stars to the bulge Ostriker  Tremaine 1975
The stellar age distributions of thin disk thick disk stellar halo and bulge popula-
tions therefore depend on the merger history and observational determination of these
distributions can constrain the mergers
2 The star-formation history of the thin disk
Unfortunately the star-formation history SFH of the thin disk is poorly known far
from the solar neighborhood This lack of data needs to be rectied hopefully the next
generation of imaging surveys such as Pan-STARRS will provide data for both the inner
disk and the outer disk Theoretical expectation in a wide range of models is that star
formation should proceed on faster timescales in the denser regions due to the shorter
dynamical times there so that inner denser regions of disks are expected to have an
older mean age even if the time of the onset of star formation is xed Chemical evolution
models see Pipino  Matteuccis contribution to this volume also favor slower star-
formation in the outer parts to match metallicity gradients In hierarchical-clustering
models as noted above the onset of star formation in the thin disk is later for the outer
parts due to the later accretion of the higher-angular momentum gas to form the outer
21 The onset of star formation in the local disk
The star-formation history of the local disk has been derived using a variety of techniques
the details of which are discussed with limitations and advantages elsewhere in this
volume Ages of the oldest stars have been estimated from isochrone-tting with the
result that the oldest stars are less than 2 Gyr younger than the metal-poor globular
clusters ie ages of  11 Gyr eg analyses of the Hipparcos dataset by Binney et
al 2000 analyses of local stars with Stromgren photometry by Nordstrom et al 2004
Nordstrom this volume Holmberg Nordstrom  Andersen 2008 White-dwarf cooling
ages are model-dependent as discussed at length in the contributions by Salaris and by
Kalirai in this volume and oldest ages of  12 Gyr are compatible with the luminosity
function data eg Fig 8 of Salaris this volume but note that the models of Hansen et
al 2002 utilised in Kalirais paper in this volume favour a younger oldest age These old
ages are consistent with an early onset of star formation in the local disk assuming that
the stars found locally were born locally the lookback time of the onset corresponding
to redshift z 
The exponential scale-length of low-mass stars of spectral type like the Sun and later
in the disk is  2  3 kpc eg Juric et al 2008 who used M-dwarfs as tracers Thus
if the old stars in the solar neighborhood were formed close to their present location in
the disk star formation was initiated at  3  4 scalelengths at z  2 This would then
imply that the formation of extended disks was not delayed until after a redshift of unity
 the typical epoch of the last major merger for a 1012 M halo in CDM  as has been
Rosemary FG Wyse
proposed in CDM-models with feedback eg Weil et al 1998 Thacker  Couchman
2001 Governato et al 2007
Alternatively the old stars in the local thin disk could have formed elsewhere and
more recently arrived in the solar neighborhood  two such scenarios have been proposed
with these old stars forming in either a satellite galaxies that are assimilated later on
circular orbits Abadi et al 2003 or b the inner disk and migrating outwards due to
the inuence of transient spiral arms Roskar et al 2008ab In the rst scenario the
satellites that could provide stars on near-circular orbits at the solar neighborhood would
most probably have to be massive so that dynamical friction operating on a timescale
proportional to the inverse of the satellite mass can be eective in damping the satellites
orbit prior to its member stars being accreted These satellites are the most capable of
self-enrichment and may be expected to contribute not just old stars but also younger
stars If the pattern of elemental abundances produced were anything like those found
in the surviving satellites bearing in mind that these old disk satellites are proposed
to be accreted relatively recently after a redshift of unity then these should give a
distinct signature in particular low values of Fe at low FeH At least two groups 
Ruchti Fulbright Wyse et al 2009 in prep using the RAVE survey eg Steinmetz
et al 2006 to select their sample and Reddy  Lambert 2008  are obtaining and
analyzing elemental abundance data for metal-poor thick disk stars and have found
nothing distinctive
In the second scenario one again expects a signature in the elemental abundance
pattern of local stars since ecient radial mixing of stars from distant regions with
dierent star-formation histories gives increased scatter eg Francois  Matteucci 1993
Schoenrich  Binney 2009 Migration has been proposed to explain in particular metal-
poor disk stars locally in the disk Haywood 2008 with a large fraction of these stars
to have come inwards to the solar neighborhood from the outer disk These metal-poor
disk stars are again of all ages except younger that  2 Gyr plausibly the travel time of
the migration including the oldest ages so this migration would imply an early onset
for the outer disk beyond the solar circle even more dicult to explain in CDM than
early star formation at the solar circle Haywood 2008 proposes that migrated stars do
indeed complicate the interpretation of trends in the elemental abundance patterns but
as we discuss below section 32 cf Reddy Lambert  Allende Prieto 2006 the scatter
is small and the uncertainties in the kinematic basis for the assignment of stars to the
dierent components of the Galaxy provides an alternative explanation for outliers
22 Variation over time
Again various techniques have been used to estimate the temporal variation of the star-
formation rate in the local disk Several nd evidence for bursts in star-formation ac-
tivity of amplitude 2  3 superposed on an underlying slow variation Examples include
the isochrone-based analysis of the Color Magnitude Diagram CMD of the Hipparcos
dataset by Hernandez Gilmore  Valls-Gabaud 2000 providing a temporal resolution
of 50 Myr albeit with a sample selection that limited the analysis to only the last  3 Gyr
and adopting a xed metallicity which is a reasonable simplication for this narrow age
range These authors found a quasi-periodic variation with period of  05 Gyr which
they suggested could be due to the passage of spiral arms
Cignoni et al 2006 developed their own approach to the analysis of the Hippar-
cos CMD and derived the star-formation history back to  12 Gyr adopting an age-
metallicity relation They found good agreement with the earlier results of Hernandez et
 I thank Roelf de Jong for his question after my talk
The SFH of the Milky Way Galaxy
al for the younger stars after rebinning them into 1 Gyr bins to match time resolutions
As is well-known older disk stars have higher-amplitude random motions with resultant
wider epicyclic excursions about their orbital guiding-center The derived star-formation
rates at older ages then trace a larger portion of the disk and stars formed locally a long
time ago may have been lost from the sample Cignoni et al investigated the possible
kinematic dependence of their derived SFH by excluding stars more than n n  1 2
away from the canonical local thin-disk 3D-space motion distribution and found that
the resulting distributions focussing on ages less than  6 Gyr were indistinguishable
and thus unaected by dynamical diusion
The major result is a broad peak at ages  2  6 Gyr with the star formation rate
at  3 Gyr being a factor of 2-3 higher than either of the present-day rate or the rate
at ages greater than 6 Gyr This increase is perhaps attributable to triggering of star-
formation activity by an accretion event This overall SFH is consistent with the analysis
of low-mass M-stars using H activity as an age indicator by Fuchs Jahrei  Flynn
2009 see their Fig 5 for comparisons with others the chromospheric-activity based
analysis of G-stars by Rocha-Pinto et al 2000 shows more high-frequency variations
and less of a consistent increase in star-formation activity back to  5 Gyr
Fuchs et al 2009 argue that the Milky Way follows the Schmidt-Kennicutt star-
formation law found for external disk galaxies which would imply that an increase in
gas supply inow accretion accompanied the increased level of star-formation rate
 5 Gyr ago In any case it is reassuring to nd that the Milky Way is typical
The possibility of signicant re-distribution of stars via radial migration in addition
to the radial epicyclic excursions considered already in the above papers needs to be
considered as it raises the issue of to which regions of the disk does the derived SFH
apply Roskar et al 2008a appeal to radial migration in particular to build-up the
outer disk dened by a break in the gas surface density and correspondingly following
the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in the stellar surface density The outer HI disk of the
Milky Way does indeed show such a break at Galactocentric distance of 12  13 kpc
well beyond the solar circle see Fig 5 of Levine Blitz  Heiles 2008 and similar in
location to the edge of the stellar disk at 12  14 kpc Reyle et al 2008 In the model of
Roskar et al 2008a stars currently beyond the break are those that are most likely to
have migrated several kpc outwards R  4 kpc see their Fig 2 a signicantly larger
distance than their typical epicyclic excursions of  2 kpc The root-mean-square change
in radius across the scale and lifetime of all the disk stars in this model is  24 kpc more
comparable to the  15 kpc epicyclic excursions estimated from observed kinematics
of the  3  5 Gyr-old stars that dominate locally Looking more closely at the model
solar circle Roskar et al 2008b nd that as much as half of the stars could have been
born outside 7  9 kpc with a bias to metal-rich stars from interior regions As discussed
above the mixing of stars from regions of dierent star-formation histories should lead
to scatter in the elemental abundances and the evidence is that only a small fraction
of stars do not follow well-dened trends within observational uncertainty Bensby et
al 2005 Feltzing  Bensby this volume Haywood 2008 Reddy Lambert  Allende
Prieto 2006 Reddy  Lambert 2008 The implication is that radial excursions are limited
to mixing predominantly regions of very similar star-formation histories and chemical
enrichments  either because there is little radial variation in star-formation history over
much of the disk or there is little radial migration It will be very interesting to analyse
the signicantly larger samples of fainter stars with elemental abundances that will be
feasible with planned instruments such as HERMES on the Anglo-Australian telescope
and WFMOS a Gemini instrument on the Subaru telescope

3 The star-formation history of the thick disk
31 Formation and early evolution
The Galactic thick disk was dened 25 years ago through star counts at the South
Galactic Pole in which two vertical exponential components were manifest Gilmore 
Reid 1983 with the general concensus now that is separate and distinct from the Galactic
thin disk Analysis Juric et al 2008 of the deep uniform wide-eld imaging data from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS conrmed the necessity for two disk components
and the best-t global thick-disk parameters are an exponential scale-length of 36 kpc
and exponential scale-height of 900pc with 12 of the local stellar mass-density in the
thick disk These combine to give a total mass equal to 1020 of the stellar mass of
the thin disk or  1010 M Stars in the thick disk have distinct kinematics elemental
abundances and ratios and age distributions when compared to the thin disk or stellar
halo Similar structures have been identied in the resolved stellar populations of external
disk galaxies eg Mould 2005 Yoachim  Dalcanton 2006
There are several mechanisms by which a thick stellar disk could result see eg
Gilmore Wyse  Kuijken 1998 Majewski 1993 Thick disks seems inevitable in CDM
due to the heating inherent during the expected late merging and assimilation of satel-
lites into pre-existing thin stellar disks Simulations with a cosmological distribution of
subhalos in terms of both their mass function and their orbital characteristics conrm
this and also show that the most massive satellite dominates the heating eg Hayashi 
Chiba 2006 Kazantzidis et al 2008 see Hopkins et al 2008 for a dissenting view based
however on an analysis using the same satellite orbital distribution as Hayashi  Chiba
In agreement with earlier simulations that focussed on the accretion of one satellite in
isolation a satellite that is dense enough to survive to inuence the disk and of total
dissipationless mass ratio 10-20 of that of the stellar disk will produce a thick stellar
The heating is achieved via a mix of local deposition of energy plus excitation of
resonances Sellwood Nelson  Tremaine 1998 and a thin-disk component can persist
Kazantzidis et al 2008 Of course subsequent accretion of gas and perhaps stars can
re-form a thin disk Dissipation naturally leads to a thin disk after accretion of gas
while accretion of stars into a thin-disk component requires circular orbits for the parent
system of those stars
The stars in the thick disk in this scenario creation by heating from a pre-existing thin
disk would have an age distribution that reected that of the thin disk that was heated
into the thick disk With the continuous fairly smooth derived star-formation history of
the local thin disk starting at the earliest epochs lookback times  1012 Gyr recent
accretion merging and associated heating would then produce a thick disk that at the
present time would have stars of age equal to the look-back time of the accretion unless
the accreted satellite were easily destroyed eg was of low relative density Turning this
around if the thick disk originated through merger-induced heating of the thin stellar
disk the last signicant dened as  20 mass ratio to the disk robust dense satellite
of stars and dark matter merger can be dated by the young limit of the age distribution
of stars in the thick disk an age distribution of stars in the thick disk that goes down
to say 5 Gyr would allow a merger and heating at a redshift of zlast  05 when the
lookback time equals 5 Gyr but if all thick disk stars are old then the last signicant
merger was long ago The age of the oldest thick disk stars in this scenario also further
constrains the epoch at which an extended thin stellar disk was in place available to be
heated
The SFH of the Milky Way Galaxy
32 Ages of the oldest stars
Analyses of the turn-o age of the thick disk stellar population within a few kpc of the
solar neighborhood agree that the bulk of the thick disk stars are old The well-dened
turn-o color for the spectroscopically derived typical metallicity of a star in the thick
disk of  06 dex is equal to that of Galactic globular clusters of similar metallicity
eg 47 Tuc corresponding to an age of 10  12 Gyr eg Gilmore  Wyse 1985 Carney
Latham  Laird 1989 Gilmore Wyse  Jones 1995 Ivezic et al 2008 their appendix
This is equal to the estimated age of the oldest thin disk stars locally as discussed above
Ages for individual slightly evolved thick-disk stars can be estimated from Stromgren
photometry These analyses show that the mean age is certainly older than that of the
local thin disk but there are disagreements in the fraction of thick disk stars that are
younger than the globular cluster ages plausibly largely due to the diculties in the
assignment of an individual nearby star to a specic component either the thin or thick
disk This probabilistic assignment is based on kinematics and the standard assumption
is that the space motions of each of the local thin disk and thick disk are adequately
modelled by three one-dimensional Gaussians eg see Feltzing  Bensbys contribution
to this volume Bensby et al 2007a 2004ab Reddy Lambert  Allende Prieto 2006
This is clearly an over-simplication for the thin disk given that moving groups have been
robustly identied in the local disk eg Dehnen 1998 Dehnen  Binney 1998 Famaey
et al 2005 Bensby et al 2007b with properties consistent with being dynamically
induced by a combination of the Galactic bar and transient spiral arms eg Dehnen
2000 de Simone Wu  Tremaine 2004 As noted above radial migration within the
thin disk may occur and may also be a complicating issue for the kinematics-based
population assignments and this has yet to be analysed in detail The likely production
of high-velocity outliers in the thin disk kinematics by such mechanisms as three-body
interactions can also complicate the population assignments
Indeed Reddy et al 2006 their Fig 24 suggest that a signicant fraction of younger
thick disk stars are in fact contaminants from the thin disk Evidence for an age-
metallicity trend within the thick disk does remain in their sample although once these
thin disk contaminants are removed the thick disk shows no evidence for the incorpora-
tion of iron from Type Ia supernovae in the elemental abundance pattern their Fig 20
An age spread of several Gyr could be consistent with this constant Type II plateau in
the Fe ratios plus a typical timescale for Type Ia chemical enrichment of  1 Gyr
if the thick disk consisted of stars from several independent star-formation regions each
of which had a short  
 1 Gyr duration but dierent onset times However with age
uncertainties of 2 Gyr the data are also consistent with a narrow age range with mean
 12 Gyr on their age-scale and a simpler interpretation of the elemental abundance
pattern as reecting a global short duration of star formation  1 Gyr
33 Implications for merger history
The old age of thick disk stars 
 10 Gyr limits the last signicant minor merger to
have occured at a redshift 
 2 While the last major merger in CDM typically is at
this epoch it is minor mergers that are constrained by heating of the thin disk into a
thick disk and these are expected to continue to lower redshifts eg Stewart et al 2008
The inferred quiescent merger history of the Milky Way is atypical in CDM As we will
now discuss consistent limits on the minor-merger history are obtained from the derived
star-formation history of the central bulge
Rosemary FG Wyse
4 The star-formation history of the central bulge
During mergers the expectation is that existing disk stars and gas to fuel star for-
mation will be added to the bulge eg Kaumann 1996 perhaps through an inter-
mediate stage of build-up of a massive inner disk that subsequently becomes unstable
eg Bower et al 2006 The dense inner regions of satellites can also survive to be added
to the bulge if dynamical friction is ecient enough and the satellite massive and dense
enough Gravitational torques due to the mildly triaxial inner bulgebar will also drive
modest gas inows at the present day eg Englmaier  Gerhard 1998 in the plane of
the disk
As discussed in detail in Fulbrights contribution to this volume while there are
younger stars in the central regions these are conned to the disk plane and the cen-
tral bulge is dominated by old 10  12 Gyr metal-rich stars with enhanced alpha-
element ratios These properties point to bulge formation in an intense short-lived burst
of star formation in situ a deep potential-well being required to reach the observed
high metallicities a long time ago eg Elmegreen 1999 Ferreras Wyse  Silk 2003
and the contribution by Pipino  Matteucci in this volume The inferred star-formation
rate is reasonable of order 10 Myr for a total mass of  1010 M and an age range of
 1 Gyr
Thus unless the inner disk is composed of uniformly old stars there can have been no
recent disk instability to form the barbulge There is little room for signicant build-up
of the central bulge by recent mergers with the old age again limiting signicant merger
activity to redshifts 
 2 This matches the constraints from the thick disk and leads to
the suggestion Wyse 2001 that perhaps both bulge and thick disk were formed by the
same last signicant minor merger
An alternative suggestion consistent with the low value of the angular momentum
content of the bulge and the similarity of the specic angular momentum distributions
of the bulge and stellar halo see Fig 1 is that the bulge formed from gas ejected from
the early star-formation regions in the halo Carney Latham  Laird 1990 Wyse 
Gilmore 1992 Gas must have been lost from the stellar halo since all indications are
that the stellar Initial Mass Function IMF was normal at both high and low masses
eg Wyse 1998 but the mean metallicity is far below the yield for that IMF see
Hartwick 1976 for the basic model
5 The star-formation history of the halo
The bulk of the stellar halo by mass interior to Galactocentric distances of  20 kpc
is rather uniform in its properties the stars  and globular clusters  are old and metal-
poor and show enhanced elemental abundances Fe in particular that are indicative
of short durations of star formation in low-mass star-forming regions with normal
Type II-progenitor stellar IMF These properties are unlike those of most stars in satellite
galaxies now Particular attention recently has been paid to the dierences in elemental
abundance patterns cf Venn et al 2004 Geisler et al 2007 The dierences can be
understood in terms of the dierent star-formation histories of the eld halo and the
surviving satellite galaxies  the former having a narrow stellar age-range and rapid
chemical enrichment and the latter having a wide stellar age-range and slow inecient
enrichment allowing incorporation of iron from Type Ia supernovae and hence low
Fe even at low levels of overall enrichment eg Gilmore  Wyse 1991 Unavane
Wyse  Gilmore 1996 Lanfranchi  Matteucci 2003
Comparison of the age distributions alone leads to the conclusion Unavane et al 1996
The SFH of the Milky Way Galaxy
Figure 1 Adapted from Wyse  Gilmore 1992 their Figure 1 Specic angular momentum
distributions of the bulge solid curve the stellar halo short-dasheddotted curve the thick
disk long-dasheddotted curve and the thin disk long-dashed curve The bulge and stellar
halo have similar distributions with most of the mass at low angular momentum curves passing
through upper left of the gure The distributions of thick and thin disks are also similar to
each other with signicant mass fraction at high angular momentum
that accretion into the eld halo from stellar satellites with a typical extended SFH has
not been important for the last  8 Gyr this time coming from the estimated lower limit
to the ages of stars in the eld halo Their analysis of the distribution of the eld halo stars
in the color-metallicity plane allows perhaps  10 by mass to have been accreted later
predominantly in the metal-rich tail of the halo Of course satellites like the Ursa Minor
dSph composed of only old metal-poor stars could be accreted and assimilated into the
eld halo at any time and would not be distinguishable on the basis of age or metallicity
However such satellites are rare at the present time Early disruption of a few massive
satellites could form the stellar halo of total stellar mass  109 M eg Robertson
et al 2005 but we need to understand what causes the necessary cessation in star
formation when for example the LMC has not been so aected
A signicant fraction of stars in the outer halo could have been accreted from the Sgr
dSph Ibata Gilmore  Irwin 1994 which is on an orbit with periGalacticon of  25 kpc
and apoGalacticon  50 kpc eg Ibata et al 1997 Tidal arms from this system are
seen across the Galaxy eg Majewski et al 2003 Fellhauer et al 2006
6 Concluding remarks
The old mean stellar ages and short durations of star formation of the thick disk and
bulge argue for little late accretion and merging into the Milky Way Accretion after a
redshift of  2 should have been predominantly smooth of gas-dominated low-density
systems The relatively high mean metallicity plus inferred rapid star formation from the
ages and elemental abundance patterns of both components argues for star formation
within deep potential wells This favours in situ star formation of each of the bulge and
thick disk and rapid mass assembly of the overall Milky Way
The presence of very old stars ages 
 10 Gyr in the local thin and thick disks argues
for the existence of an extended disk at redshift  2
Rosemary FG Wyse
The old mean stellar age and inferred short duration of star formation of the bulk
of the stellar halo implies that the eld halo cannot have formed from systems like the
existing satellites which typically have had much more extended star-formation histories
The low mean metallicity plus curtailed star formation argues for star formation within
shallow potential wells so that early mass loss is facilitated Instead of such low-mass
systems the CDM-based models favour a few massive satellites accreted early as the
source of the eld halo Robertson et al 2005 Sales et al 2007 rapid gas loss is assumed
to occur by ram pressure stripping but this assumption needs to be modelled
The quiescent merging history and rapid mass assembly of the Milky Way is unusual
in CDM However surveys of galaxies at redshift z  2 nd rapid star formation and
chemical enrichment and extended disks similar to the inferences for the Milky Way at
that look-back time eg Maiolino et al 2008 Daddi et al 2008 Genzel et al 2008
However our understanding of the global star-formation history of the Milky Way
remains incomplete For this we need to determine the detailed age distributions spatial
distributions space motions and elemental abundances for large samples of Galactic
stars both locally and more globally Several large imaging surveys are planned in the
near future and these need to be matched by large spectroscopic surveys at both high
and low spectral resolution These will be challenging but worth the investment

Discussion
Rosemary FG Wyse
de Jong Recently it has for instance been argued by Roskar et al 2008 that radial
migration of stars is much larger than previously estimated meaning that stars in the
solar neighbourhood do not reect the local star formation history but instead a com-
bination of central Galaxy star formation and migration history If this is the case how
can we disentangle these eects
Wyse The thin disk at the solar neighborhood shows little scatter in elemental abun-
dance ratios and this is hard to reconcile with stellar migration over many kpc mixing
regions of dierent star-formation history If migration is limited to 
 1 kpc then I do
not believe it will aect the derived local SFH signicantly since normal stellar orbits
sample that range
Melbourne What percentage of stars in the thin disk are old Are they coeval with
the thick disk Would they be thick disk stars
Wyse The analyses of the derived local star-formation histories do not have a very
good handle on the oldest stars since they are faint but estimates eg Cignoni et
al 2006 suggest 10 in the 10-12 Gyr range These have thin-disk kinematics so they
are probably not thick-disk members modulo uncertainties in population assignment
It is dicult to distinguish ages 10-12 Gyr so although the oldest thin disk stars may
be  1 Gyr younger than the thick disk it is best to say both are old
King Youve said little or nothing about the bar Is it merely the manifestation of a
dynamical instability or should we be able to learn something from it about the formation
history of the Milky Way
Wyse We still dont know much about the evolutionary state of the bar It is clear
that the Milky Way bulge shows some characteristics of pseudo-bulges for example
an exponential surface-density prole but the uniform old age argues against a recent
disk-bar instability to form the bulge given the evidence for recent star formation in the
inner disk But we do need to get more data on the stellar populations in the inner disk
