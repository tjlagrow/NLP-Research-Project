ABSTRACT
Far-infrared ux densities are newly extracted from the IRAS database for
the RSA and CfA complete samples of Seyfert galaxies These data are used to
classify the Seyfert galaxies into those where the far-infrared continuum emission
is dominated by the active galactic nucleus AGN circumnuclear starburst or
host galaxy
While AGN-dominant objects consist of comparable numbers of Seyfert 1 and
2 galaxies starburst- and host-dominant objects consist preferentially of Seyfert
2 galaxies Thus in addition to the dusty torus the circumnuclear starburst
region and host galaxy are important in hiding the broad-line region
Morphologically starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are of later types and
more strongly interacting than AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies In a later-type
galaxy the AGN central engine has a lower Eddington luminosity and the gaseous
content is higher The gas is eciently supplied to the starburst via a galaxy-
galaxy interaction Morphologies of host-dominant Seyfert galaxies are of various
Since starbursts in Seyfert galaxies are older than those in classical starburst
galaxies we propose an evolution from starburst to starburst-dominant Seyfert to
host-dominant Seyfert for a late-type galaxy An evolution from AGN-dominant
Seyfert to host-dominant Seyfert is proposed for an early-type galaxy These
sequences have durations of a few  108 yr and occur repeatedly within a galaxy
during its evolution from a late type to an early type

INTRODUCTION
The traditional classication of Seyfert galaxies is Seyfert 1 versus Seyfert 2 This
is a spectroscopic discrimination Optical broad recombination lines are seen in Seyfert 1
galaxies while they are not seen in Seyfert 2 galaxies The so-called torus model claims that
the two types are identical but are observed in dierent orientations Around the broad-line
region BLR and the central engine there is a parsec-scale axisymmetric structure ie a
dusty torus It is claimed that the torus hides the BLR along our line of sight to a Seyfert
2 galaxy eg Antonucci 1993
However the torus model does not explain some of dierences observed between Seyfert
1 and 2 galaxies In particular a circumnuclear starburst is found more frequently among
Seyfert 2 galaxies The starburst region and associated gas clouds might hide the BLR in
some of Seyfert 2 galaxies eg Heckman et al 1989 Osterbrock 1993 Moorwood 1996
They actually tend to have dust lanes being irregular or running across the nucleus Malkan
Gorjian  Tam 1998
The morphological type and interaction property are also dierent Seyfert 2 galaxies
tend to be objects of later types and more strongly interacting eg Osterbrock 1993 De
Robertis Yee  Hayhoe 1998 Dultzin-Hacyan et al 1999 Such objects favor starbursts
as explained later The observed dierences might be due to Seyfert 2 galaxies where the
BLR is hidden by a starburst region
Therefore circumnuclear star formation is crucial to understanding Seyfert galaxies It
is of interest to classify a sample of Seyfert galaxies into those with and without starbursts
and compare their demographics eg the number ratio of Seyfert 2 to Seyfert 1 galaxies
the morphological distribution and so on To the extent of our knowledge an analysis of
this kind has not been carried out1
Since the spectral energy distribution is dierent between Seyfert galaxies with and
without starbursts their relative numbers in a certain sample are aected by its selection
criterion This selection bias is serious if Seyfert 1 galaxies are compared directly with Seyfert
2 galaxies but it is not serious in the above approach
The useful signature of a starburst is an enhancement of far-infrared FIR contin-
uum emission which is due to dust reradiation of ultraviolet photons from OB stars eg
1Just before the submission of our manuscript we realized that a similar work had been done by Storchi-
Bergmann et al 2001 see also Cid Fernandes et al 2001 With ultraviolet to optical spectra of nuclear
regions they had classied a sample of luminous Seyfert 2 galaxies compared the morphological type and
interaction property and obtained results that are consistent with ours

Rodriguez Espinosa Rudy  Jones 1987 Wilson 1988 Mouri  Taniguchi 1992 When
dominated by a starburst the FIR spectrum provides constraints on the stellar population
For a large number of Seyfert galaxies FIR ux densities at 60 and 100 m were measured
by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS
We accordingly study circumnuclear star formation in Seyfert galaxies From the raw
IRAS data FIR ux densities are newly extracted for well-dened samples of Seyfert galaxies
2 We also obtain FIR data of nuclear-starburst galaxies and construct a scheme to select
starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies 3 Using this scheme we classify the Seyfert galaxies
compare their observational properties and discuss mechanisms to hide a BLR as well as a
connection between starburst and Seyfert activities 4
Throughout this paper we focus on Seyfert galaxies
ie galaxies with moderate-
luminosity active galactic nuclei AGNs High- and low-luminosity AGNs eg QSOs and
LINERs are not of our interest They could have dierent connections with starburst activ-
ities Seyfert galaxies have several subtypes We put the subtypes 10 and 15 into Seyfert
1 and the subtypes 18 19 and 20 into Seyfert 2 Seyfert 18  19 galaxies are dened to
exhibit faint broad lines These intermediate types which have an interesting character are
shown separately in the following diagrams
2 SAMPLES AND DATA
Our Seyfert galaxies are those from optical spectroscopic surveys of two complete
magnitude-limited samples of galaxies the Palomar survey for the Revised Shapley-Ames
RSA Catalog of Bright Galaxies and the Center for Astrophysics CfA redshift survey
Spectroscopic classications were made with homogeneous data of the surveys For refer-
ence we also study Markarian Mrk starburst galaxies These three samples of galaxies are
listed along with observational data in Appendix A
RSA galaxies serve as a fair representation of the local galaxy population They lie
in the northern sky and are equal to or brighter than 125 mag in the total B-band Ho
Filippenko  Sargent 1997a conducted an extensive survey of the nuclei and found 52
Seyfert galaxies
CfA galaxies are more distant and luminous than RSA galaxies The selection criteria
are   0 and b  40 or   25 and b  30 and mB  145 Here mB is the apparent
blue magnitude on the Zwicky-B0 system for the entire galaxy Huchra  Burg 1992
and Osterbrock  Martel 1993 dened a sample of 48 Seyfert galaxies
 4 
Table 1 shows that CfA Seyfert 1 galaxies lie over larger distances than CfA Seyfert
2 galaxies Seyfert 1 galaxies harbor bright nuclei which contribute signicantly to the
total blue magnitudes Osterbrock  Shaw 1988 To correct for this bias our CfA Seyfert
1 sample is restricted to galaxies with mB  140 Their median distance is similar to
that of CfA Seyfert 2 galaxies We have accordingly excluded extreme objects such as the
ultraluminous infrared galaxy Mrk 231 It should be noted that observational data of CfA
Seyfert 1 galaxies with mB  140 are nevertheless given in Appendix A
The above bias is negligible exceptionally in the RSA Seyfert sample where the nucleus
is not luminous and overwhelmed by the host galaxy in the B-band Maiolino  Rieke 1995
In addition while the CfA sample misses galaxies with low-luminosity Seyfert nuclei Huchra
 Burg 1992 the RSA sample is complete to such objects Maiolino  Rieke 1995 Ho et
al 1997a Thus the RSA sample is more reliable than the CfA sample
Nevertheless the CfA sample is complete to galaxies with luminous Seyfert nuclei which
are relatively rare in the RSA sample It is interesting to compare these two samples The
CfA sample also consists of well-studied objects Only with this sample statistical analyses
of some observational quantities are possible
Mrk galaxies are those exhibiting strong ultraviolet continua Balzano 1983 selected
102 starburst galaxies They do not form a complete sample but have been regarded as
classical examples of galaxies with ongoing nuclear starbursts We exclude faint objects and
use 57 objects in the same magnitude range as CfA Seyfert galaxies mB  145
For the sample galaxies FIR ux densities at 60 and 100 m are extracted from the IRAS
database using the processor SCANPI which estimates total ux densities of an extended
source Appendix A Since galaxies are often resolved by the IRAS detectors point-source
ux densities given in the current IRAS catalogs tend to be underestimates of the true FIR
emission As a measure of FIR properties of those galaxies the total ux densities obtained
here are preferable Even for point sources SCANPI provides improved sensitivity and
accuracy If we exclude galaxies where the IRAS data are not available our nal samples
consist of 50 RSA Seyfert 37 CfA Seyfert and 56 Mrk starburst galaxies
The observational data such as the Zwicky-B0 magnitude mB and the Hubble type
index T are compiled from the literature Appendix A Although the mB values are mostly
photographic they are suciently accurate for our purpose error  03 mag Huchra 
Burg 1992 and have been measured for almost all the galaxies The other data are also
accurate This is because we have excluded faint distant or extreme objects from the
samples

3 CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
Using Mrk starburst galaxies we construct a scheme to classify Seyfert galaxies into
those where the FIR emission is dominated by the AGN starburst or host galaxy The
last class is not relevant directly to the starburst-Seyfert connection but exists as a denite
If host-dominant Seyfert galaxies were not separated from AGN- and starburst-
dominant Seyfert galaxies distinction between the latter two would be unclear Since RSA
CfA and Mrk galaxies have dierent distances Table 1 we base our classication scheme
on distance-independent quantities
Starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are dened as those with FFIRFB  1 Here
FFIR is the FIR ux between 40 and 120 m Fullmer  Lonsdale 1989 and FB is the
monochromatic ux at 043 m Lang 1980 p 560 Their denitions are
FFIR  126  1011 258S60  S100 erg s1 cm2
FB  216  105 dex 04mB erg s1 cm2
where S is the ux density at  m in units of Janskys Thus FFIRFB is equivalent to
the FIR luminosity normalized by the total blue luminosity Within and around a starburst
region there is a large amount of dust grains which absorb ultraviolet photons from OB stars
and reradiate them at FIR wavelengths Mrk starburst galaxies actually exhibit FFIRFB  1
as shown in Figure 1a For a sample of more than 1000 inactive galaxies Devereux  Hameed
1997 found FFIRFB  1
The observed FB value is dominated by stellar light of the host galaxy Although star
formation in the host galaxy depends on its morphological type eg Kennicutt 1998 this
dependence is not serious to the present criterion for starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies
Our result for Mrk starburst galaxies and that of Devereux  Hameed 1997 for inactive
galaxies are independent of the morphological type
Host-dominant Seyfert galaxies are dened as those with S100S60  3 This is a con-
straint on the dust temperature Outside star forming regions the interstellar radiation is
weak the dust temperature is low and the local value of S100S60 is large For example
diuse gas in our Galaxy the cirrus exhibits S100S60  48 Boulanger  Perault 1988
which corresponds to the dust temperature of 27 K if dust grains radiate as a graybody
with an emissivity proportional to 1 On the other hand Mrk starburst galaxies exhibit
S100S60  3 as shown in Figure 1b
The criterion FFIRFB  1 for starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies is consistent with
the criterion S100S60  3 for host-dominant Seyfert galaxies No galaxy in our samples
 6 
simultaneously exhibits FFIRFB  1 and S100S60  3 This is because in a starburst
region the dust temperature is high and the local value of S100S60 is small
Finally AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies are dened as those with FFIRFB  1 and
S100S60  3 The optical to infrared continuum of an AGN is a superposition of emissions
from the central engine and from gas and dust at various distances from the central engine
Empirically the spectral energy distribution is approximated as S   with   1 eg
Ward et al 1987 Elvis et al 1994 which yields FFIRFB  1 and S100S60  2 Since the
spectrum has a turnover at a FIR wavelength and the host galaxy dominates the observed
FB value we safely expect FFIRFB  1 and S100S60  3 for an AGN-dominant Seyfert
galaxy
The ux densities at 25 m and 21 cm are enhanced over that at 60 m in AGNs These
enhancements have been used to select AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies However there are
confusing cases such that the FIR emission at 60 m is dominated by a starburst while the
mid-infrared emission at 25 m and the radio emission at 21 cm are dominated by an AGN
eg NGC 1068 Wilson 1988 Our selection criterion is thus preferable
4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
RSA and CfA Seyfert galaxies are classied into those dominated by the AGN starburst
or host galaxy Their statistics are summarized in Table 2 Their object numbers are shown
as a function of morphological type in Figures 2 and 3 For these and the other histograms
open hatched and lled areas are used to denote Seyfert 1015 1819 and 20 galaxies
respectively The classication for each of the objects is given in Appendix A
We believe that our classication is reliable Table 2 lists well-known Seyfert galaxies
in the RSA and CfA samples They fall into appropriate classes For the other galaxies
also our classication is consistent with those in the literature eg a catalog of Seyfert
galaxies with circumnuclear starbursts Gu Dultzin-Hacyan  de Diego 2001 if we admit
that the relative importance among the AGN starburst and host galaxy could vary for the
wavelength In addition properties studied with our histograms are systematically dierent
among the three classes For essential dierences the condence level estimated from the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is given in the gure caption
Figures 2 and 3 highlight our most important results While AGN-dominant objects
consist of comparable numbers of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies starburst- and host-dominant
objects consist preferentially of Seyfert 2 galaxies Morphological types of AGN-dominant
Seyfert galaxies are earlier than those of starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies Host-dominant
 7 
Seyfert galaxies are of various morphologies They are numerous in the RSA sample but not
so in the CfA sample These characteristics form the basis of the following discussion
41 Obscuration of Broad-Line Region
Here we discuss mechanisms to hide a BLR To estimate interstellar extinction outside
the AGN we use the narrow-line Balmer decrement FHFH2 Its intrinsic value is about 3
The Balmer decrement was measured for RSA Seyfert galaxies by Ho et al 1997a Their
data are shown in Figure 4 Seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit FHFH  5 except for an edge-on
galaxy NGC 4235 Only when the extinction is small the BLR is observable
411 AGN-Dominant Seyfert Galaxies
The BLR of an AGN-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxy is hidden by the dusty torus As in the
case of Seyfert 1 galaxies an AGN-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxy always exhibits a small value
of the Balmer decrement FHFH  5 Fig 4 Outside the AGN there is not sucient
material to hide the BLR
Since the dusty tori are in random orientations their typical opening angle torus is
obtained from the number fraction fS1 of Seyfert 1 galaxies as costorus2  1  fS1 Oster-
brock  Shaw 1988 Osterbrock  Martel 1993 see also Lawrence 1991 In our RSA and
CfA samples respectively AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies have fS1  040 and 044 Table
2 which yield torus  110 The opening angle is unlikely to depend on the morphological
type of the galaxy This is because the morphological distribution is not dierent between
AGN-dominant Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies Figs 2 and 3
The torus values obtained previously are underestimates The previous studies did not
exclude starburst- and host-dominant objects They are mostly Seyfert 2 galaxies where the
BLR is hidden by the circumnuclear starburst region or host galaxy see below Our present
estimate based on AGN-dominant objects alone is more reliable
The narrow-line region of a Seyfert galaxy is often observed to be conical or biconical
with the apex at the nucleus This ionization cone is due to collimation of the ionizing
2Since our Seyfert galaxies were dened on ux ratios of optical emission lines 2 the AGN dominates
the observed H and H uxes even if there exists a circumnuclear starburst Since the narrow-line region
is larger than the BLR the FHFH values do not necessarily represent extinction toward the BLRs of the
individual Seyfert galaxies They are nevertheless useful in a statistical analysis of the BLR extinction
 8 
radiation which is in turn due to shadowing by the dusty torus However the opening angle
of the ionization cone cone is less than that of the torus torus cone  40100 Wilson 
Tsvetanov 1994 The eective opening angle for the ionizing radiation is relatively small
if the torus does not have a well-dened edge Some additional processes might be at work
in shaping the ionization cones Wilson  Tsvetanov 1994 and references therein
412 Starburst-Dominant Seyfert Galaxies
Starburst-dominant objects consist preferentially of Seyfert 2 galaxies Figs 2 and 3
see also Table 2 The BLR is hidden eciently by the circumnuclear starburst region3
In fact starburst-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxies exhibit large values of the Balmer decrement
FHFH  5 Fig 4 contrasting to the case of AGN-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxies
Within the starburst-dominant class the orientation determines whether the object
is observed as a Seyfert 1 or 2 galaxy If our line of sight is blocked by the dusty torus or
circumnuclear starburst region the BLR is not observable The torus is responsible for hiding
the BLR in Seyfert 2 galaxies with exceptionally small values of the Balmer decrement
The circumnuclear starburst region has a covering factor of 1223 This is because
the number fraction of Seyfert 1 galaxies among starburst-dominant objects is a factor of 23
lower than that among AGN-dominant objects and also because 23 of starburst-dominant
Seyfert galaxies exhibit FHFH  5 Fig 4
Between Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies a dierence in the reddening of the narrow-line region
has long been known eg Dahari  De Robertis 1988 This dierence is inconsistent with
the torus model and is attributable to the presence of starburst-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxies
The extinction within the narrow-line region is not dierent between Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies
judging from our result for AGN-dominant objects Fig 4
413 Host-Dominant Seyfert Galaxies
Host-dominant objects consist preferentially of Seyfert 2 galaxies Figs 2 and 3 see also
Table 2 In addition to obscuration by the dusty torus or circumnuclear starburst region
3The term circumnuclear starburst region in our discussion on obscuration of a BLR is used to indicate
both the starburst region itself and the associated gas clouds Although a large amount of circumnuclear
gas alone is sucient to hide the BLR the presence of such gas leads to the occurrence of a starburst
Conversely the occurrence of a starburst requires the presence of a large amount of gas
 9 
another mechanism hampers the detection of the BLR Since the AGNs are weak nuclear
optical spectra of these objects are dominated by bulge stars Even if there exist the broad
lines they are severely diluted by stellar absorption features This mechanism is important
when extinction outside the AGN is small For FHFH  5 actually the number fraction
of Seyfert 2 galaxies among host-dominant objects is higher than those among AGN- and
starburst-dominant objects Fig 4 In host-dominant Seyfert 2 galaxies with FHFH  5
a circumnuclear starburst region might exist and hide the BLR
Since we are among the rst to dene host-dominant Seyfert galaxies explicitly see also
Osterbrock 1993 we give examples NGC 3031 is a nearby bright Seyfert 1 galaxy
BLR is not discernible without careful removal of the underlying starlight eg Filippenko
 Sargent 1988 If distant and faint this object would be classied as a Seyfert 2 galaxy
The other example is NGC 4395 which harbors the least luminous known Seyfert nucleus
Filippenko  Sargent 1989
Nicastro 2000 predicted theoretically that a BLR is intrinsically absent in some of
weak AGNs This prediction is not inconsistent with our result although we have adopted
a conservative assumption that a BLR exists in every AGN
Host-dominant Seyfert galaxies are much more numerous in our RSA sample than they
are in our CfA sample RSA galaxies harbor less luminous AGNs than CfA galaxies 2
With decreasing the luminosity an AGN becomes more liable to be overwhelmed by the host
galaxy We consider that this tendency extends to LINERs the least-luminosity AGNs
Intermediate-Type Seyfert Galaxies
The number ratio of Seyfert 18  19 to Seyfert 20 galaxies is higher in our CfA
sample than it is in our RSA sample Figs 2 and 3 see also Table 2 Especially among
CfA starburst-dominant objects Seyfert 18  19 galaxies entirely account for the observed
overabundance of Seyfert 2 galaxies CfA Seyfert galaxies harbor luminous AGNs 2 Their
broad lines tend to be too strong to be hidden completely
Within the individual galaxy samples the number ratio of Seyfert 18  19 to Seyfert
20 galaxies is relatively high among starburst- and host-dominant objects The circumnu-
clear starburst region or host galaxy hides the BLR less completely than the dusty torus
Starburst-dominant Seyfert 18  19 galaxies could be in orientations where the starburst
region is not so optically thick Host-dominant Seyfert 18  19 galaxies could be just the
objects where the BLR is diluted by the stellar bulge They make up an important fraction
of host-dominant objects with FHFH  5 Fig 4 Among the other classes of objects
 10 
with FHFH  5 Seyfert 18  19 galaxies are rare and Seyfert 1015 galaxies are
instead as ubiquitous as Seyfert 20 galaxies
42 Properties of Circumnuclear Starbursts
Circumnuclear starbursts in Seyfert galaxies are relatively old Their starburst ages
are of order 108 yr while those of classical starburst galaxies are of order 107 yr This
fact was rst noticed by Glass  Moorwood 1985 and Mouri  Taniguchi 1992 Up to
now the observational evidence has been obtained for various quantities stellar colors and
absorption features at optical wavelengths Schmitt Storchi-Bergmann  Cid Fernandes
1999 stellar colors at near-infrared wavelengths Dultzin-Hacyan  Benitez 1994 Hunt et
al 1997 equivalent width of the Br line Oliva et al 1995 and so on Mouri  Taniguchi
1992 pointed out that the age dierence implies an evolution from a starburst galaxy to a
starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxy
Young star formation does not exist around an AGN The circumnuclear starburst occurs
at radii of 102103 pc while the fueling of the AGN occurs at radii of  100 pc Since it
takes time to transport gas from the circumnuclear region to the nucleus there is a delay
between the onset of the starburst and that of the AGN activity Moorwood 1996 Schmitt et
al 1999 Accordingly a starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxy evolves from a young starburst
galaxy
The starburst age aects the ux density ratio S100S60 Mouri  Taniguchi 2000 A
starburst region consists of star clusters In a young starburst stellar light is absorbed by
dust grains in the vicinity of the individual clusters However in an old starburst stellar
winds and supernova explosions have pushed away those grains and stellar light is of longer
wavelengths and travel distances before absorbed by grains The FIR emission originates in
grains that lie far from the star clusters Since the radiation eld there is weak the grain
temperature is low and the local value of S100S60 is large
Figure 5 shows that starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies have larger values of S100S60
than Mrk starburst galaxies Although some of the Seyfert galaxies appear to suer from the
AGN component with low S100S60 an important fraction of them has S100S60  2 The
median value S100S60  229 was obtained for a sample of old starburst galaxies by Mouri
 Taniguchi 2000 Appendix B These galaxies have starburst ages of order 108 yr Thus
our result is consistent with the previous estimates for starburst ages of Seyfert galaxies
 11 
43 Morphological Type and Interaction Property
Figures 2 and 3 show that AGN- starburst- and host-dominant Seyfert galaxies have
dierent distributions of the morphological type see also Table 2 While AGN-dominant
Seyfert galaxies are around the types S0aSa T  01 starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies
are around the types SbSbc T  34 The same result was obtained by Storchi-Bergmann
et al 2000 from an analysis of near-ultraviolet spectra of Seyfert 2 galaxies Morphological
types of host-dominant Seyfert galaxies cover those of AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert
galaxies
The morphological dierence observed between AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert
galaxies implies that in a later-type galaxy the AGN is more probable to be weak and
overwhelmed by a circumnuclear starburst The mass of the AGN central engine a black
hole scales with that of the galaxy bulge Ferrarese  Merritt 2000 Gebhardt et al 2000
Thus in a later-type galaxy the central engine is less massive The Eddington luminosity is
accordingly lower In addition a later-type galaxy has a higher content of gaseous material
and is more favorable for a starburst eg Roberts  Haynes 1994 Kennicutt 1998
The upper panel of Figure 6 shows the interaction class IAC determined by Dahari 
De Robertis 1988 for CfA Seyfert galaxies The IAC is a one-dimensional integer scale
and describes the presence of a companion and distortion in the galaxy ie signatures of
a galaxy-galaxy interaction IAC  1 for an isolated and symmetric galaxy and IAC  6
for a strongly interacting and distorted one While AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies include
a larger percentage of non-interacting systems starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies include
a larger percentage of interacting systems
The lower panel of Figure 6 shows the amplitude 0 of the two-point correlation function
r determined by De Robertis et al 1998 for CfA Seyfert galaxies The function r 
rr0177  0r177 gives the excess probability for nding a companion at distance r from
the galaxy The search radius was 250 kpc While AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies tend
to reside in somewhat sparse environments 0  0 starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies
tend to reside in dense environments 0  0 This is not an artifact of the well-known
morphological segregation ie earlier types in denser environments eg Roberts  Haynes
1994 Starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are of later types than AGN-dominant Seyfert
galaxies The tendency is opposite
We do not have enough data for host-dominant Seyfert galaxies Their interaction
properties are expected to cover those of AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies as
in the case of morphological types if we rely on the following discussion see below and 44
Since an accretion rate as low as 102 M yr1 is sucient to sustain the typical
 12 
luminosity 1010 L of a Seyfert nucleus mechanisms necessary for transporting the gas
to the nucleus could be as modest as internal processes such as bars due to gravitational
instabilities of the galaxy disk Combes 2001 This is the situation in AGN-dominant Seyfert
galaxies However the gas consumption rate in a starburst is higher of order 100 M yr1
for 1010 L eg Moorwood 1996 Kennicutt 1998 Hence a starburst-dominant Seyfert
galaxy prefers an external process ie a tidal interaction with a nearby galaxy which is
more ecient to transport a large amount of gas to the circumnuclear and nuclear regions
Overall whether a Seyfert galaxy is dominated by the AGN or circumnuclear starburst
depends on the morphological type and interaction property AGN- and starburst-dominant
Seyfert galaxies are separated more clearly in the morphological type Figs 2 3 and 6
Thus although the relatively unclear separation in the interaction property could be par-
tially due to a delay in the emergence of the activity after the onset of interaction the
morphological type appears to be more important For example if the galaxy is of a late
type and thus contains a large amount of gas even a modest mechanism supplies sucient
fuel to the starburst The morphological type also aects consequences of an interaction
Especially in a late-type galaxy the absence of a massive bulge enhances the gas inow and
hence the starburst Mihos  Hernquist 1994a4
44 Possible Evolutionary Scenario
The evolution of Seyfert galaxies was discussed by among others Heckman et al 1989
Osterbrock 1993 and Moorwood 1996 Their scenarios are summarized as in terms of
our classication scheme starburst  starburst-dominant Seyfert  AGN-dominant Seyfert
 host-dominant Seyfert  LINER Here we propose a somewhat dierent scenario
Observed ages of circumnuclear starbursts represent the typical lifetime of a starburst-
dominant Seyfert galaxy of order 108 yr 42 The lifetimes of AGN- and host-dominant
Seyfert galaxies are roughly of the same order This is because in our RSA sample Fig 2
and Table 2 the number of starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies is comparable to those of
AGN- and host-dominant Seyfert galaxies5
4The exception is a major merger Mihos  Hernquist 1994b Even in an early-type galaxy merging
with a galaxy of comparable mass eventually overwhelms the eect of the bulge We do not consider this
violent event which tends to result in an extreme object such as an ultraluminous infrared galaxy
5The numbers of AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies are comparable also in our CfA sample
Fig 3 and Table 2 However this sample misses host-dominant Seyfert galaxies and is thus unsuited to
estimating their typical lifetime 2 and 413
 13 
The lifetimes estimated here are consistent with characteristic time scales of Seyfert
and starburst activities The Salpeter time scale is the time over which the mass of a black
hole increases by a factor e eg Osterbrock 1993 It is of order 108 yr if the eciency in
converting the rest mass energy of infalling gas to the radiation is 10 and the bolometric
luminosity is 10 of the Eddington luminosity The gas consumption time scale is the time
over which a starburst consumes the available gas at the observed star formation rate It
is of order 108 yr for classical starburst galaxies eg Moorwood 1996 Kennicutt 1998 but
see also Appendix B
Our estimates imply that AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies do not have
a direct evolutionary connection There are systematical dierences in the morphological
type and interaction property 43 which do not vary markedly in 108 yr The dynamical
time scale of a galaxy is of order 108 yr It takes much longer time for a galaxy to change
from a late type to an early type The time scale of an interaction is also  108 yr In the
case of an unbound interaction for example the companion with a typical relative velocity
of 300 km s1 does not move a signicant distance away from the Seyfert galaxy in 108 yr
De Robertis et al 1998 Many interacting systems actually exhibit no signs of a Seyfert
activity Dultzin-Hacyan et al 1999 see also De Robertis et al 1998
The other implication is that a Seyfert activity is repetitive Since 10 of the RSA
galaxies are Seyfert galaxies Ho et al 1997a every galaxy spends 10 of the total lifetime
as a Seyfert galaxy The present-day age of a galaxy is of order 1010 yr Hence a Seyfert
activity with a duration of order 108 yr has occurred several times within the same galaxy
There could even exist a possibility that an interacting galaxy becomes repeatedly a Seyfert
galaxy see also Appendix B
Starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies evolve from young starburst galaxies 42 These
are late-type galaxies Since starbursts occur also in early-type galaxies Fig 1 see also
Kennicutt 1998 some of AGN-dominant Seyfert galaxies could evolve from young starburst
galaxies Their vigorous AGNs could readily overwhelm the starbursts If a supermassive
black hole does not exist at the center a starburst galaxy evolves to an old starburst galaxy
such as those studied by Mouri  Taniguchi 2000 Appendix B The origin of a supermassive
black hole is attributable to a past starburst episode It was recently discovered that the
starburst galaxy M 82 harbors a black hole with a mass being intermediate between those
of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes Kaaret et al 2001
With a decrease of the fuel supply AGN- and starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies be-
come less luminous and evolve to host-dominant Seyfert galaxies Their number density is
comparable to that of AGN- or starburst-dominant Seyfert galaxies at each of the morpho-
logical types Fig 2 With a further decrease of the fuel supply host-dominant Seyfert
 14 
galaxies evolve to LINERs
The typical evolution of a Seyfert galaxy is summarized as follows Suppose a late-type
spiral galaxy where gas fueling into its nuclear region is triggered internally or externally
The resultant starburst leads to formation of a supermassive black hole When the gas
fueling occurs again our galaxy evolves to starburst  starburst-dominant Seyfert  host-
dominant Seyfert  LINER This sequence is repeated a few times The repetition of
starburst and Seyfert events exhausts the gas and increases the mass of the black hole The
galaxy morphology changes to an early type Consequently our galaxy becomes to evolve
to starburst  AGN-dominant Seyfert  host-dominant Seyfert  LINER Indeed some
evolutionary sequences could start from middle stages
Our scenario is in accordance with a likely evolution process of galaxy bulges ie
repetition of gas inows from the disk triggered internally or externally eg Wyse Gilmore
 Franx 1997
It is predicted that bulges of many early-type galaxies contain old stars
formed during distinct starburst episodes in the past Although the existing data are not
conclusive this prediction would provide an observational test for our scenario
5 CONCLUDING SUMMARY
FIR ux densities at 60 and 100 m have been extracted from the IRAS database for
the RSA and CfA complete samples of Seyfert galaxies We have subsequently classied the
Seyfert galaxies into those where the FIR continuum emission is dominated by the AGN
starburst or host galaxy see Table 2 for denition and number statistics This classication
has turned out to be more fundamental than the traditional spectroscopic classication
Seyfert 1 versus Seyfert 2
AGN-dominant objects consist of comparable numbers of Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies The
dusty torus with an opening angle of torus  110 is responsible for hiding the BLR The
morphological types are around S0aSa Figs 2 and 3 There are few interacting systems
Fig 6
Starburst-dominant objects consist preferentially of Seyfert 2 galaxies Obscuration of
Its covering factor is 1223
a BLR by a circumnuclear starburst region is important
The observed narrow-line Balmer decrements are actually high Fig 4 The morphological
types are around SbSbc Figs 2 and 3 There are many interacting systems Fig 6
Host-dominant objects consist preferentially of Seyfert 2 galaxies They are numerous
in the less-luminous RSA sample Even if the BLR is not obscured its emission is diluted
 15 
by stellar absorption features The morphological types cover those of AGN- and starburst-
dominant Seyfert galaxies Fig 2
The torus model is thus incomplete Seyfert 2 galaxies where the BLR is hidden by the
torus are in the minority It is estimated from our result for AGN-dominant objects that the
total number of such Seyfert 2 galaxies is as small as the total number of Seyfert 1 galaxies
The condition for predominance of a circumnuclear starburst is determined by the mor-
phological type which is related to the mass of the central black hole and the total amount
of available gas and the interaction property which is related to the eciency of gas fueling
The former appears to be more important than the latter
Since starbursts in Seyfert galaxies are older than those in classical starburst galaxies
Fig 5 we have proposed the evolutionary path of starburst  starburst-dominant Seyfert
 host-dominant Seyfert  LINER for a late-type galaxy The evolutionary path proposed
for an early-type galaxy is starburst  AGN-dominant Seyfert  host-dominant Seyfert
 LINER The individual stages of Seyfert activities have time scales of order 108 yr These
sequential activities occur several times within a galaxy during its evolution from a late type
to an early type

A OBSERVATIONAL DATA AND THEIR STATISTICS
Table 3 summarizes observational data of RSA and CfA Seyfert galaxies Table 4
summarizes observational data of Mrk starburst galaxies with mB  145 Table 5 gives
median values of several quantities for these galaxies They were calculated with the Kaplan-
Meier estimator Feigelson  Nelson 1985 which is implemented in the numerical code
ASURV Rev 12 Lavalley Isobe  Feigelson 1992 This estimator cannot handle upper
and lower limits simultaneously If necessary we handled data with upper and lower limits
separately and calculated the object-number-weighted average
The present sample of Mrk starburst galaxies does not include Mrk 732 and Mrk 897
which are in the original catalog Balzano 1983 but have turned out to be Seyfert galaxies
eg Osterbrock  Pogge 1987 Keel 1996
 16 
For RSA and CfA Seyfert galaxies respectively the spectral types 10 15 18 19
and 20 were from Ho et al 1997a and Osterbrock  Martel 1993 When these two
references assign dierent types to the same object we preferred the type in Osterbrock 
Martel 1993
The coordinates were mainly from the Third Reference Catalogue of Bright Galaxies
RC3 compiled by de Vaucouleurs et al 1991 see also Corwin Buta  de Vaucouleurs
1994 The coordinates of the Seyfert galaxies Mrk 205 and Mrk 841 were from Huchra
 Burg 1992 Those of the starburst galaxies Mrk 220 Mrk 409 and Mrk 489 were
determined with the 21 cm image of the NRAO VLA Sky Survey Condon et al 1998 For
these coordinates we estimated the IRAS uxes
The distances were mainly from the nearby galaxy catalog of Tully 1988 which is
almost complete to galaxies closer than 40 Mpc For galaxies that are not listed in Tully
1988 the distance was estimated from the recession velocity in the cosmic microwave
background frame and a Hubble constant H0  75 km s1 Mpc1 The recession velocities
were from RC3 Exceptionally those of the Seyfert galaxies Mrk 205 and Mrk 841 were from
Huchra et al 1983
The Hubble type indices T were mainly from RC3 For the Seyfert galaxies Mrk 335 I
Zw 1 NGC 1144 Mrk 461 NGC 5695 and NGC 6104 as well as the starburst galaxies Mrk
102 Mrk 190 Mrk 203 Mrk 307 Mrk 353 Mrk 691 Mrk 809 and Mrk 1002 the indices
were from catalogs of the CfA survey Huchra Vogeley  Geller 1999 Huchra Geller 
Corwin 1995 Huchra et al 1983
The apparent blue magnitudes mB on the Zwicky-B0 system were from in decreasing
order of preference Huchra et al 1999 1995 1990 1983 Zwicky et al 19611968 and
Markarian et al 1989 For the Seyfert galaxies NGC 1358 and NGC 1667 we used the
RC3 photographic magnitude
The IRAS ux densities at 12 25 60 and 100 m were determined using the processor
SCANPI which projects the individual scan tracks crossing the target position onto a mean
one-dimensional scan subtracts baselines coadds the scans and provides estimates of ux
densities There are two coaddition methods We usually adopted the noise-weighted mean
If it disagrees with the median by more than 1 we adopted the latter Then we examined
the scan prole and judged whether the source was unresolved or resolved For an unresolved
source we used the best-tting point-source template as the estimator of the ux density
If the t was poor we instead used the peak ux density for a bright source or the ux
density integrated over a xed range for a faint source The integration ranges at 12 25
60 and 100 m were 2 2 25 and 4 respectively These ranges were also used
 17 
to integrate the ux density of a faint resolved source For a bright resolved source the
integration was made between the zero crossings The upper limit was set to be 3 If there
could exist contamination of a nearby object we indicate so in Table 3 or 4 Flux densities
were determined in the same manner by Soifer et al 1989 and Sanders et al 1995 If
available we used their data For galaxies with large apparent diameters we preferentially
used two-dimensionally coadded ux densities of Rice et al 1988
B COMMENTS ON NUCLEAR-STARBURST GALAXIES
The star formation rate of a nuclear starburst varies largely in time A plausible approx-
imation is a series of burst events The individual bursts have durations of order 106107 yr
and probably correspond to formation of groups of star clusters The entire series could
have a long duration  108 yr which reects time scales of gas fueling gas consumption
due to star formation gas removal due to stellar winds and supernova explosions and so on
eg Leitherer 2001
Classical starburst galaxies such as Mrk objects are biased in favor of galaxies with
ongoing bursts ie young starburst galaxies They are selected by optical line emission
which originates in ionized gas around O stars However there are numerous B stars also
which have long lifetimes and are responsible for most of the FIR emission With an increase
of the burst age above the burst duration O stars become few but B stars remain numerous
and the FIR emission remains strong Mouri  Taniguchi 2000 studied such old starburst
galaxies in the RSA sample These galaxies are at quiescent stages between burst events or
at post-starburst stages see also Kennicutt 1998
A nuclear starburst occurs several times within the same galaxy Mrk starburst galaxies
have burst ages of order 107 yr and account for 3 of all the galaxies Balzano 1983 Calzetti
1997 Old starburst galaxies studied by Mouri  Taniguchi 2000 have burst ages of order
108 yr and account for 3040 of all the galaxies These number fractions are too large to
be explained by a single series of burst events in a galaxy which has an age of order 1010 yr
The prototypical starburst galaxy M 82 harbors a fossil starburst 6  108 yr old which had
a duration of a few  108 yr and an ongoing starburst 12  107 yr old de Grijs OConnell
 Gallagher 2001 Since a starburst is caused by gas fueling into the nuclear region as in
the case of a Seyfert activity this fact is consistent with our scenario that the gas fueling
and hence the Seyfert activity are repetitive 44
Morphological types of old starburst galaxies tend to be later than those of young
starburst galaxies and Seyfert galaxies Mouri  Taniguchi 2000 see also Ho Filippenko 
 18 
Sargent 1997b Since a supermassive black hole prefers an early type 43 this tendency
is consistent with our scenario that a young starburst galaxy without a supermassive black
hole evolves to an old starburst galaxy 44
