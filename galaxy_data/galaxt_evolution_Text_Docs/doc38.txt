Abstract We review the most recent observational results on the formation and evolution
of early-type galaxies and their mass assembly by focusing on the existence properties and
role of distant old massive passive systems to z  2 the stellar mass function evolution

1 Introduction
Early-type galaxies ETGs play a crucial role
in cosmology They represent the most mas-
sive galaxies in the local Universe contain
most of the stellar mass M and are the pri-
mary probes to investigate the cosmic history
of galaxy mass assembly As ETGs are the
most clustered galaxies they are also funda-
mental in tracing the evolution of the large
scale structures Because of the correlation be-
tween the black hole and galaxy bulge masses
ETGs are also important to investigate the co
evolution of normal and active galaxies
Although ETGs at z  0 are rather sim-
ple and homogeneous systems in terms of
morphology colors stellar population content
and scaling relations Renzini 2006 their for-
mation and evolution is still a debated ques-
tion In the so called monolithic collapse sce-

evolution of the stellar population However
in the modern scenario of CDM cosmology
the evolution of the gravitational perturbations
implies that galaxies assembled their mass
more gradually through hierarchical merging
of CDM halos and make the monolithic col-
lapse unlikely or even unphysical For instance
the most recent CDM hierarchical models
predict that most of the ETG stellar mass is as-
sembled at 0  z  1 De Lucia et al 2006
The modern generation of galaxy surveys can
test the dierent predictions on the evolution of
the number density colors merger types and
rates luminosity and mass functions and pro-
vide a crucial feedback to improve the theoret-
ical simulations
Despite the intense observational activity
on ETG evolution a general consensus has not
been reached yet For instance recent results
based on optically-selected moderately deep
R  24 samples of red sequence ETGs
eg COMBO-17 DEEP2 Bell et al 2004
Faber et al 2005 suggest a strong evolution
of the number density with z displaying
an increase by a factor of 6 from z  1
Cimatti Early-type galaxy evolution
to z  0 and a corresponding increase by a
factor of 2 of their stellar mass density since
z  1 Dissipationless ETGETG merging
also called dry merging is advocated to ex-
plain how ETGs assembled at 0  z  1
Bell et al 2005 van Dokkum 2005 HST op-
tical moderately deep I  24 samples of
morphologicallyselected ETGs also suggest
a substantial decrease of the number density
with n  1  z25 Ferreras et al 2005 and
spatially resolved color maps show that 30-
40 of ETGs at 0  z  12 display varia-
tions in their internal color properties eg blue
cores and inverse color gradients suggestive of
recent star formation activity in a fraction of
the ETG population Menanteau et al 2004
However
the optically-selected I  24
VIMOS VLT Deep Survey VVDS does not
conrm the above ndings and shows that
the rest-frame B-band luminosity function of
ETGs selected based on the SED is con-
sistent with passive evolution up to z 
11 while the number of bright ETGs seems
to decrease only by 40 from z  03
to z  11 Zucca et al 2005 The over-
all picture is made more controversial by re-
cent results indicating a weak evolution of
the stellar mass function Fontana et al 2004
Caputi et al 2006 Bundy et al 2006 and that
dry mergers cannot represent the major con-
tributors to the assembly of ETGs at 0  z  1
Bundy et al 2006 Masjedi et al 2005
2 The problem of selection effects
After the discovery of the strong clustering
of ETGs at z  1 Daddi et al 2000 it be-
came clear that a major source of uncertainty
was the cosmic variance Daddi et al 2000
Somerville et al 2004 and that
its eects
could explain the discrepant results often found
by narrow-eld surveys such as the dif-
ferent content of luminous high-z ETGs in
the HDF-North and HDF-South Zepf 1997
Benitez et al 1999
Another important source of uncertainty is
played by the heterogeneous criteria adopted
to select and classify ETGs deep vs shal-
low surveys optical vs near-infrared color
vs morphological vs spectrophotometric or
spectral energy distribution SED selections
ETGs have strong kcorrections in the opti-
cal as they become rapidly very faint for in-
creasing redshifts and can be easily missed in
opticallyselected samples eg Maoz 1997
while the kcorrections are much smaller in
the near-infrared A possible example is given
by recent results Yamada et al 2005 based
on a large sample of ETGs at z  1 ex-
tracted from a  1 square degree eld in the
SubaruXMM-Newton Deep Survey  Despite
the eld as large as that covered in COMBO-
17 the number density of ETGs at z  1 turns
out to be substantially larger than that derived
at z  095 in COMBO-17 probably due to the
deeper and redderband selection z  25 vs
R  24
bias
van Dokkum  Franx 2001 plays
in the comparison between low and high
redshift ETG samples As the the morphology
of galaxies are expected to evolve some low-z
ETGs were spiral galaxies or mergers at higher
redshift These young ETGs are included
in low redshift samples but drop out of the
samples at high redshift Therefore the high
redshift samples are a biased subset of the low
redshift samples containing only the oldest
progenitors of low-z ETGs ie the ones with
morphological and spectral properties similar
to the nearby ETGs
progenitor
3 High redshift ETGs
What is the highest redshift at which we still
nd ETGs similar to those observed at z  0 
After the isolated case of a spectroscopically
identied old ETG counterpart of a radio
source at z  155 Dunlop et al 1996
studies based on the HDF-South and HDF-
North suggested the existence of a substantial
number of photometricmorphological ETG
candidates up to z  2 Treu et al 1998

their stellar populations
are rather homogeneous in age and metal-

and that the isophotal structure of z  1
ETGs obeys the correlations already observed
among nearby elliptical galaxies

no signicant structural dierences between

Pozzetti et al 2003
Fontana et al 2004
Glazebrook et al 2004 Bundy et al 2006
However due to the strong cosmic vari-
ance the number density of high-z ETGs is
still so poorly constrained that

4 Downsizing
Fig3 Moreover
Distant ETGs have a higher stellar mass-
to-optical light ratio MLR than late-type
the same redshift
star-forming galaxies at
Fontana et al 2004
MLR shows an overall trend decreasing from
low to high redshifts but with a substantial
scatter that can be interpreted as due to a wide
range of formation redshifts andor star forma-
tion histories see also McCarthy et al 2001
Cimatti et al 2003 The typical MLR of more
luminous objects MR  22 is signicantly
larger than that of the fainter ones MR  22
at low and intermediate redshifts Fig3 This
implies that while the MLR of the luminous
population is consistent with either very short
star-formation time-scales  or high forma-
tion redshifts z f  3 and some objects ap-
pear to require both the less luminous popu-
lation experienced a more recent history of as-
sembly as indicated by the larger  and lower
required to reproduce the typical MLR
Fig 3 Thus the most luminous and massive
ETGs reach the completion of star formation
rst while less massive ones have a more pro-
longed star formation activity till later times
This downsizing scenario was rst noted by
Cowie et al 1996 and it is now supported by
several results which suggest that galaxy evo-
lution is strongly driven by the galaxy mass
It is interesting to note that recent studies of
ETGs at z  0 have reached consistent conclu-
sions Thomas et al 2005

Additional clues on downsizing come
from the most recent results on the evo-
both in the eld and in distant clusters
van der Wel et al 2004
Treu et al 2005
di Serego Alighieri et al 2005
Jorgensen et al 2006 The FP at z  1
shows already a remarkable small scatter and
with respect to the local FP an oset and a
possible rotation The evolution of the overall
FP can be represented by a mean change in
the eective mass-to-light ratio but with a
rate depending on the dynamical mass being
slower for larger masses This dierential
evolution is consistent with stellar populations
that formed at z f  2 and z f  1 for high- and

low-mass ETGs respectively Although the
relation between the measured ML evolution
and mass is partially due to selection eects
because the galaxies are selected by luminos-
ity not mass the ML  mass relation still
holds even if this selection eect is taken into
account These results indicate that the fraction
of stellar mass formed at recent times ranges
from 1 for M  10115M to 20-40
below M  1011M and that there is no
signicant dierence between the evolution of
massive eld and cluster ETGs Fig4
Recently it has been found that while the
bright end of the cluster colour-magnitude
relation is already built at z  08
faint end is still in the process of build-up
Tanaka et al 2005 see also De Lucia et al
2004 In contrast to this the bright end of
the eld colour-magnitude relation has been
built all the way down to the present-day but
the build-up at the faint end has not started
yet This suggests again the downsizing evo-
lutionary pattern massive galaxies complete
their star formation rst and the truncation of
star formation is propagated to smaller objects
as time progresses This trend is likely to de-
pend on environment since the build-up of the
colour-magnitude relation is delayed in lower
density environments The evolution of galax-

ies took place earliest in massive galaxies and
in high-density regions and it is delayed in less
massive galaxies and in lower density regions
Other evidences of the downsizing sce-
nario come from the evolution of the stellar
surveys
consistently indicate that the high-mass tail of
the stellar mass function which is populated
mostly by ETGs Fig6 evolves weakly from
z  0810 to z  0 compared to the local stel-
lar mass function and slower than the low-mass

Caputi et al 2006
Bundy et al 2006
Pannella et al 2006 Franceschini et al 2006
Recently Bundy et al 2006 conrmed
this downsizing evolution of the stellar mass
function per galaxy type up to z  1 by using
the DEEP2 spectroscopic sample In addition
they identied a mass limit MQ above which
star formation appears to be quenched This
threshold mass evolves as  1  z45 ie it
decreases with time by a factor of 5 across
the redshift range of 04  z  14 while
no signicant correlation has been found be-
tween downsizing and environment with the
exception of the most extreme environments
ie the ones hosting higher numbers of ETGs

5 Comparison with model
predictions
These high-z old and massive ETGs are
very rare objects in most N-body  semi-
analytic simulations published to date The
predicted number densities are much lower
than the observed ones up to a factor
of 10 in some cases with this discrep-
ancy becoming larger for increasing redshift
Somerville et al 2004 However as there are
enough dark matter halos to host these unex-
pected massive galaxies Fontana et al 2004
what becomes crucial is to understand how
the physics and evolution of baryons within
the halos can explain the properties of high-z
ETGs and how it is possible to build-up mas-
sive ETGs at higher redshifts than expected

Granato et al 2004
Menci et al 2004
Nagamine et al 2005 Silva et al 2005 The
most recent simulations Springel et al 2005
are also capable to predict a downsizing
evolutionary pattern for the star formation but
most of the mass assembly still occurs at mod-
erately low redshifts 0  z  1 and a specic
comparison with the observed properties and
evolution of the ETGs has not been published
yet De Lucia et al 2006 Bower et al 2005
It is interesting to mention that very recent
hydrodynamic simulations showed that it is
possible to build a realistic massive M  1011
M giant elliptical galaxy with a plausible
formation history without requiring neither
recent major mergers nor
feedback from
supernovae or AGN but
simply starting
from appropriate CDM initial conditions
Naab et al 2005
6 Searching for the progenitors
The spectral and color properties of
distant old ETGs discussed in Section
3 imply unambiguously a star
formation
history with strong  100 M yr1 and
short-lived  01-03 Gyr starburst where

Circles and triangles indicate the brighter and fainter
subsamples respectively The dashed line indicates

of all ETGs whereas the dashed-dotted line is the
D4000 measured in the SDSS composite of ETGs
Eisenstein et al 2003
lation is stronger in more luminous systems
suggesting a higher formation redshift of the
most massive ETGs Mignoli et al 2005
Additional evidence supporting the down-
sizing scenario comes from the results on the
star formation history properties Feulner et
al 2005 found that at all redshifts lower
mass galaxies show higher specic star for-
mation rates SSFR  S FRM than higher
mass galaxies and that the highest mass galax-
ies contain the oldest stellar populations at all
redshifts With increasing redshift the SSFR
for massive galaxies increases by a factor of
10 reaching the era of their formation at z 
2 and beyond These ndings can be inter-
preted as evidence for an early epoch of star
formation in the most massive galaxies and
for ongoing star formation activity in lower
mass galaxies Similar results have been found
also in other recent works Juneau et al 2005

In addition the ETG precursors should also

in massive dark matter halos and strongly

have indeed uncovered galaxies matching the

Daddi et al 2004b The BzKselected star-
bursts with Ks  20 are on average more
reddened massive and star-forming than
the optically-selected star-forming galaxies
they show a signicant overlap with
other star-forming galaxy populations in the
same redshift range selected based on other
opticalnear-IR criteria
Reddy et al 2005
or on midinfrared - to - radio selections
Daddi et al 2005b Dannerbauer et al 2006
The properties of the BzKselected starbursts
suggest that these galaxies are massive galax-
ies caught during their major activity of mass
assembly and star-formation possibly being
the progenitors of the present-day massive and
metal-rich ETGs At the stellar mass threshold
of M  1011M the number density of these
BzKselected starbursts is comparable with
that of old passively evolving galaxies in
the same redshift range of 14  z  25

GMASS Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep
Spectroscopic Survey is a new ongoing spec-
troscopic project based on an ESO Large
Program PI A Cimatti aimed at doing ul-
tradeep spectroscopy with VLTFORS2 of
galaxies selected at 45m with SpitzerIRAC
adopting two simple criteria m45m 230
AB and zphot  14 The integration times
are very deep 15-30 hours per spectroscopic
mask The main scientic driver of GMASS
is the spectroscopic identication and study of
the high-z progenitors of the massive ETGs in a
way complementary to other surveys and with
a selection more sensitive to the rest-frame
near-IR emission ie stellar mass up to z  3
