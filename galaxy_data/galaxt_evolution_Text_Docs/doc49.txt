ABSTRACT
We compare the number density of compact small size massive galaxies at low and high redshift using
our Padova Millennium Galaxy and Group Catalogue PM2GC at z  003  011 and the CANDELS results
from Barro et al 2013 at z  1  2 The number density of local compact galaxies with luminosity weighted
LW ages compatible with being already passive at high redshift is compared with the density of compact
passive galaxies observed at high-z Our results place an upper limit of a factor  2 to the evolution of the
number density and are inconsistent with a signicant size evolution for most of the compact galaxies observed
at high-z The evolution may be instead signicant up to a factor 5 for the most extreme ultracompact
galaxies Considering all compact galaxies regardless of LW age and star formation activity a minority of
local compact galaxies  13 might have formed at z  1 Finally we show that the secular decrease of the
galaxy stellar mass due to simple stellar evolution may in some cases be a non-negligible factor in the context
of the evolution of the mass-size relation and we caution that passive evolution in mass should be taken into
account when comparing samples at different redshifts

1 INTRODUCTION
The average size of passive and massive galaxies at z  1 
25 has been observed to be much smaller than that of galaxies
of similar masses in the local Universe Daddi et al 2005
Trujillo et al 2006 Cimatti et al 2008 van Dokkum et al
2008 Cassata et al 2011 Damjanov et al 2011 to name
a few usually adopting as comparison low-z galaxies with
a Sersic index greater than 25 Shen et al 2003 These
results have suggested that galaxies have undergone a strong
evolution in size Minor dry mergers have been proposed as
the main mechanism driving such evolution Naab et al 2009
Oser et al 2012
At low redshift compact massive galaxies are a small frac-
tion of the overall population in the general eld Trujillo et
al 2009 Taylor et al 2010 Poggianti et al 2013 hereafter
P13 but are much more common in galaxy clusters Valentin-
uzzi et al 2010 hereafter V10
In P13 we have studied the population of compact mas-
sive galaxies in the local universe for the rst time on a non-
Sloan sample representative of the general eld galaxy pop-
ulation the Padova Millennium Galaxy and Group catalogue
PM2GC Calvi et al 2011 Compact PM2GC galaxies with
radii and mass densities comparable to high-z massive and
passive galaxies are mostly S0s with intermediate-to-old stel-
lar populations and have the characteristics to be likely little-
evolved descendants of high-z compact galaxies P13
At a given mass galaxies with older stellar populations are
on average more compact van der Wel et al 2009 Saracco et
al 2009 V10 P13 and references therein When high-z pas-
sive galaxies are compared with local galaxies with old stellar
populations1 their most probable descendants the average
evolution in size at xed mass between z  1  25 and z  0
turns out to be mild a factor  16 as half of the evolution
observed for the overall passive galaxy population is driven
by larger galaxies becoming passive at lower redshifts P13
A crucial aspect for assessing the real evolution in size of
individual galaxies is to evaluate how many of the distant
galaxies have remained compact till today comparing high-
and low-z number densities Cassata et al 2011 and 2013
have studied the evolution of the number density of passive
early-type galaxies and concluded this is driven by both the
size growth of compact galaxies and mostly by the appear-
ance of new early type galaxies with larger sizes Similar
conclusions are reached by Carollo et al 2013 who nd no
change in the number density of compact quenched early-type
galaxies of masses  1011M and a 30 decrease at higher
masses over the redshift interval 02  z  1 Saracco et
al 2010 comparing their high-z morphologically-selected
early-type sample with the cluster galaxies by V10 concluded
that most of the compact early-types at high-z can be ac-
counted for by their local counterparts In contrast Taylor et
al 2010 found a strong evolution in the number density of
extremely compact galaxies using as local comparison disk-
free red sequence SDSS galaxies
Recently new estimates for the number density of com-
pact high-z galaxies have become available for the GOODS-S
and UDS elds of CANDELS Barro et al 2013 hereafter
B13 This sample is unprecedented for number of galaxies
and quality and relies on selection criteria that we can try
to reproduce at low redshift In this paper we compare the
CANDELS results with our PM2GC local sample to establish
the amount of evolution in the number density of compact
galaxies This directly constrains the number of galaxies that
experienced a signicant evolution in size
We use H0 m   700307 and a Chabrier 2003
IMF to be consistent with the high-z dataset
2 DATA AND METHODOLOGY
1 Luminosity-weighted ages compatible with being already passive at
high-z
Our aim is to compare our low redshift data with the high-z
results from B13 who studied the structure of massive galax-
ies at z  14  3 in the GOODS-S and UDS CANDELS
Poggianti et al
elds We use the number densities obtained by B13 for
all compact galaxies and for passive compact galaxies with
masses above 1010M for which their sample is 90 com-
plete B13 dene passive quiescent galaxies to have a
specic star formation rate  1005Gyr1 corresponding to
a star formation rate about 110 of that of typical star-forming
galaxies at z  2 on the star formation rate-mass relation
Their circularized galaxy radii were obtained with GALFIT
from HST W FC3 H-band2 images van der Wel et al 2012
and their masses with a spectrophotometric model based on
Bruzual  Charlot 2003
Our low-z analysis is based on the PM2GC a spectro-
scopically complete sample of galaxies at 003  z  011
brighter than MB  187 This sample is sourced from
the Millennium Galaxy Catalogue MGC Liske et al 2003
Driver et al 2005 a B-band contiguous equatorial survey
complemented by a 96 spectroscopically complete survey
down to B20 The PM2GC is similarly complete for masses
M  16  1010M and contains 1515 galaxies above this
The image quality and the spectroscopic completeness of
the PM2GC are superior to Sloan and these qualities make
it an interesting dataset to study galaxy sizes in a complete
sample of galaxies at low-z as outlined in P13 Effective-
radii axial ratios and Sersic indexes were measured on MGC
B-band images with GASPHOT Pignatelli  Fasano et al
2006 Bindoni et al in prep an automated tool which per-
forms a simultaneous t of the major and minor axis light
growth curves with a 2D attened Sersic-law convolved by
the appropriate space-varying PSF Details on the size mea-
surements and a comparison with independent size estimates
of PM2GC galaxies are given in P13 Galaxy stellar mass es-
timates were derived by Calvi et al 2011 using the Bell 
de Jong 2001 relation and are in good agreement with DR73
Abazajian et al 2009 masses with no offset and a  01dex
scatter P13
21 Sample selection compactness criterion
We stress that no morphological information is used in the
galaxy selection neither at high- nor at low-z
B13 dene compact those galaxies with
logMhighzr15
e   103 Mkpc15
where Mhighz is the stellar mass of high-z galaxies and re
their effective radius
The stellar mass of a system is dened as the sum of the
mass in living stars  the mass of stellar remnants4 Assum-
ing passive evolution the stellar mass of a galaxy changes
with time simply due to the evolution of its stars as they pro-
gressively evolve and eventually die they retain only part of
their mass as remnant
For a stellar generation of solar metallicity a Chabrier IMF
and the Bruzual  Charlot 2003 model the fraction of initial
stellar mass that remains is equal to 1 for ages less than 19 
106 yr while it can be approximated as f t  1749 0124 
logt at older ages where t is the age of the stellar population
in years
2 This corresponds to rest-frame wavelengths from B to R band Galaxy
sizes are larger at shorter wavelengths P13 therefore by using local B-band
sizes we obtain a conservative upper limit to the density evolution

4 The stellar mass in this paper and in general in the literature is described
by equation 2 in Longhetti  Saracco 2009
If a high-z galaxy is observed very soon after the end of the
bulk of star formation say 108 yr after by z  01 it retains
only  70 of its observed high-z mass If star formation
stopped 2 Gyr before the high-z observations at z48 for a
z2 observed galaxy this fraction is 90 We adopt an in-
termediate value of 80 corresponding to a quenching of star
formation occurred 06 Gyr before the high-z observations at
z25 for a z2 observed galaxy in line with recent observa-
tions of recently quenched galaxies at z  1  2 Wuyts et al
2010 Whitaker et al 2012 Adapting eqn 1 out compact-
ness threshold at low redshift is

It is worth noting that passive evolution in mass will also
lead to larger sizes for adiabatic expansion Hills 1980 if the
mass returned by stars to the interstellar medium is lost by
galaxies in a SN- andor AGN-driven galactic wind as indi-
cated by X-ray data for early-type galaxies Ciotti et al 1991
Such mechanism is internally driven and may contribute to the
evolution in size The effects on galaxy sizes of rapid mass
loss driven by quasar superwinds in massive galaxies and by
supernova-driven winds in less massive galaxies have been
discussed by Fan et al 2008 One type of galaxies where there
is unequivocal evidence for merger-driven evolution both in
mass and in size are the Brightest Cluster Galaxies eg Lid-
man et al 2012 Valentinuzzi et al 2010b but see also Stott
et al 2010 However such galaxies may have a very differ-
ent evolution from the rest of the massive galaxy population
Finally if B13 used Maraston 2005 model instead of
Bruzual  Charlot 2003 their high-z masses would be typ-
ically 015 dex smaller due to the different treatment of the
TP-AGB stellar phase which is important for stellar popu-
lation ages typical of high-z galaxies but is uninuential on
the masses at low-z As a consequence adopting Marastons
model the compactness density threshold at low-z would shift
to  1005 Mkpc15 In the following we will use the com-
pactness criterion based on Bruzual  Charlot unless oth-
erwise stated but we will show that this is a major source
of uncertainty in the comparison of high- and low-z samples
Above the PM2GC mass limit there are 141 compact galaxies
according to the compactness criterion based on Bruzual 
Charlot and 294 using Maraston
22 Sample selection LW ages
All PM2GC galaxies have a spectrum from the SDSS the
2dFGRS Colless et al 2001 or the MGCz Driver et al
2005 The galaxy stellar history was derived by tting the
spectra with the spectro-photometric model described in Fritz
et al 2007 2011 All the main spectro-photometric fea-
tures continuum ux and shape and emission and absorption
lines are reproduced by summing the theoretical spectra of
Simple Stellar Populations SSPs of 12 different ages from
3  106 to  14  109 years P13 From the spectral analysis
it is possible to derive an estimate of the average age of the
stars in a galaxy weighted by the light we observe The LW
age was computed by weighing the age of each SSP compos-
ing the integrated spectrum with its bolometric ux For pas-
sive galaxies this reects to a rst approximation the epoch
of the last star formation episode
The model age determination can be quite uncertain espe-
cially at the old ages considered here and it is necessary to

include a wide range of star formation histories from those mimicking the
histories of galaxies of different morphological types ellipticals to late spi-
rals to post-starbursts to constant star formation rates truncated at different
evaluate how these uncertainties affect the number density es-
timates
The spectrophotometric model obtains the best t star for-
mation history and consequent LW age by performing a ran-
dom exploration of the parameter space searching for the
combination of star formation rate and extinction values of
the various single stellar populations that minimizes the dif-
ferences between the synthetic and the observed spectra
As explained in Fritz et al
2007 the internal error on
the LW age is estimated by exploiting the characteristics of
the optimization routine The path towards the best t pa-
rameters depends on their initial value and so does the nal
solution star formation history and consequently LW age
We perform 11 simulations for each metallicity and explore
three metallicities changing both the initial parameters and
the seed of the random number generator sampling the en-
tire space of solutions The LW age error is taken to be half
the difference between the highest and lowest values of LW
age among all simulations Such error is less than 1 Gyr for
all compact PM2GC galaxies except for a few cases with a
median of 03 Gyr see left panel of Fig 1
To further test the age uncertainty we used synthetic spec-
tra of galaxy templates with different star formation histories
mimicking the histories of galaxies of different morphological
types ellipticals to late spirals post-starbursts and constant
star formation rates truncated at different times as was done
in Fritz et al 2007 The true input LW age of such tem-
plates are compared to the LW age recovered by the spectral
tting in the right panel of Fig 1 Generally the model is able
to recover the input LW age with a good approximation ex-
cept for our oldest template for which it underestimates it For

high-z compact passive galaxies dashed histogram
our purposes it is important that the model does not show a
tendency to overestimatethe LW ages thereby assigning old
ages to young galaxies
In this paper we want to compare the number density of
compact passive galaxies at high-z with that of equally com-
pact low-z galaxies whose LW age testies that they were
already passive at high-z and therefore should comply with
the B13 criterion for passivity To do this we select galaxies
at z  01 with a LW age equal to or greater than the time
elapsed between three high redshift values z  115 and 2
corresponding to lookback times 63 78 and 88 Gyr respec-
tively and z  01
Visually inspecting the spectra of all 39 59 for Maraston
compact PM2GC galaxies with LW ages  63 Gyr z1
their passivity at the time they are observed is conrmed by
the lack of emission lines only 5 7 for Maraston galaxies
have weak equivalent width OII  5  emission with line
ratios consistent with a weak AGN
Figure 2 shows that the stellar mass distribution of compact
passive high-z galaxies is similar to the mass distribution of
PM2GC compact and old LW age corresponding to z  1
galaxies and a KS-test is unable to prove there are signicant
differences P01 This is consistent with the hypothesis
that PM2GC compact and old galaxies are local counterparts
of the high-z compact and passive population
Matching progenitors and descendants is one major prob-
lem in trying to assess the number density evolution of any
type of high-z galaxies including compact galaxies Different
methods have been proposed to obtain a meaningful compar-
ison and none of them is free from problems For example
a morphological selection of early-type galaxies both at high-
and low-z does not take into account the fact that a large num-
ber of high-z late-type galaxies turn into early-type galaxies
Poggianti et al
by z0 while using a xed number density is prone to partial
contamination and relies on semi-analytic models that do not
reproduce the galaxy stellar mass function at redshifts above
zero Leja et al 2013
Our approach based on LW ages is not free from problems
either because it relies on the assumption that compact pas-
sive galaxies at high-z have not been rejuvenated by star
formation at subsequent times Indeed while it is reasonable
to assume that all local compact galaxies with old LW ages
must have been compact and passive at high-z not all com-
pact passive galaxies at high-z necessarily have old LW ages
today There might be some of their local counterparts that are
still compact but have not remained always passive through-
out their evolution as at later times they may have experi-
enced some episode of star formation such to disqualify them
from being old in the local sample Though not optimal
our method links the high-z population with at least some of
their low-z counterparts thus providing an upper limit to the
evolution of the number density of compact passive galaxies
ie to the difference between the high-z and low-z number of
such galaxies
23 Number densities
The high-z number densities for passive star-forming and
all galaxies are taken directly from B13 They are for a mass
limit 1010M which is slightly lower than the 16  1010M
PM2GC limit This difference should have little effect on the
number densities as most of the high-z compact galaxies are
well above the PM2GC limit Guillermo Barro 2013 private
communication The different limit in mass will again re-
sult in underestimating the number density of local compacts
relative to that of high-z compacts
For the PM2GC we compute the number density of com-
pact galaxies of different LW ages as described above as well
as the total number density of all low-z compact galaxies re-
gardless of their age The number of galaxies is divided by the
comoving volume of the PM2GC survey that extends over
an effective area of 3088deg2 on the sky between z  003
and z  011 No volume correction is needed as the survey
is complete down to our mass limit at z  011 Our num-
ber densities for both Bruzual  Charlot and Maraston high-z
models are given in Table 1
3 RESULTS
Figure 3 shows the mass-size diagram of all PM2GC galax-
ies above our mass limit The solid and dashed lines repre-
sent the compactness threshold of B13 with and without the
mass evolution effect respectively The compactness crite-
rion isolates galaxies approximately 2 away from the median
PM2GC mass-size relation as the plot shows This compact-
ness criterion is slightly less strict than the limit for super-
dense galaxies adopted in P13 see green points in Fig 3
Our main result is presented in Fig 4 where the number
density of low redshift compact galaxies is compared with the
high redshift values Selecting only PM2GC compact galax-
ies with LW ages at least as old as the lookback time between
z  01 and z  115 and 2 we plot their number density
values as red circles at the corresponding redshifts in the left
The largest uncertainty in the PM2GC number densities
arises from the precision of the LW age estimate obtained by
the spectrophotometric model The number density error bars
in Fig 4 take into account the change in number density vary-
ing the LW age corresponding to each redshift by 1 Gyr As

taking into account and ignoring the effect of mass evolution respectively
see text The red solid line with dotted 1 and 2 lines is the PM2GC
median Green points represent superdense galaxies according to the com-
pactness criterion adopted in P13
discussed in 221 this corresponds to the upper envelope of
the internal age uncertainty and we have no reason to believe
there should be any systematic overestimation of ages in the
modeling Such error dominates over the poissonian error
The X-axis error bar shows the 1 Gyr intervals in redshift
From Fig 4 the number ratio of high- to low-z densities is
 1 at z  1 no evolution and only  23 at z  2 The low-z
estimates are within 1-15  of the high-z estimates
The red squares in the plot show the PM2GC number den-
sities obtained adopting Maraston 2005 model at high-z
hence shifting the high-z masses and consequent compactness
threshold by 015 dex In this case high- and low-z number
density values are even closer their ratio being  16 at z  2
We stress once again that in deriving the number density at
low-z only compact galaxies that have remained passive since
high-z are counted Some high-z compact quiescent galaxies
might have remained compact till today but have experienced
star formation after they were observed at high-z and these
are not considered in our low-z compact galaxy census Our
number of old compact galaxies at low-z is therefore poten-
tially a lower limit to the number of compact quiescent galax-
ies that have remained compact Consequently the difference
between the high-z and low-z values in Fig 4 provides an up-
per limit to the number density evolution
Although an exact estimate of the evolution is hampered by
the various uncertainties involved clearly a strong evolution
in the number density of compact galaxies such as the factor
10 sometimes quoted from simulations Hopkins et al 2009
is not supported by our analysis Our results are consistent
with a small or even negligible evolution in the number den-
sity of compact galaxies suggesting that at most half of the
high-z compact galaxies have evolved in size by z  0
Evolution of compact galaxies
At low-z the total number density of compact galaxies in
the PM2GC regardless of their LW age is 47  104 Mpc3
This value is compared in the right panel of Fig 4 with
the total number density of compact passive  star-forming
galaxies in CANDELS which reaches a maximum value
29  104 Mpc3 at z  16 This comparison suggests that
the bulk of the compact galaxies have formed their structure
and their mass by z  1  15 and that an additional minority
of them up to about 13 of todays compact galaxies might
have formed at lower redshifts
This comparison also shows that the total number density
of PM2GC compact galaxies of any age is signicantly higher
than the number density of passive compact galaxies at high-
z Relaxing the restrictive assumption of no subsequent star
formation the whole population of high-z compact passive
galaxies could evolve into the local compact population
The mild number density evolution of compact passive
galaxies we nd in this paper is in good agreement with the
results from Cassata et al 2011 who found that the number
density of compact at least 1 below the local mass-size re-
lation early-type passive galaxies decreases only by a factor
of two from z  1 to z  0
31 The most extreme compact galaxies
The compactness criterion and the mass range adopted in
this paper are dictated by the B13 high-z sample to which we
aim to compare It would be desirable to assess the number
density evolution of galaxies of different masses and degree
of compactness as soon as such detailed information will be-
come available at high-z to investigate whether the evolution
varies with galaxy mass and compactness
As we have shown above the B13 criterion corresponds to
about 2 below the low-z median mass-size relation which is
similar to what most previous works used to dene compact
galaxies This is the typical degree of compactness of high-
z massive and passive galaxies found in other studies as well
except for the extremely compact galaxies in the sample at z 
2 of van Dokkum et al 2008 that are outliers in the stellar
densities and radii distributions see P13 for a discussion
We can attempt to compare our results to the work of Cas-
sata et al
2011 who considered separately the evolution
of ultra-compact early-type morphologically selected pas-
sive galaxies dened to have sizes at least 04 dex below
the local early-type mass-size relation and representing about
20-30 of their sample at z  1
If we consider PM2GC
early-type galaxies ellipticalsS0s Calvi et al 2012 that
are old in LW age z  1 and lie at least 04 dex below
the PM2GC median mass-size relation for early-type galaxies
Table 1 in P13 taking into account a 01 dex mass evolu-
tion as before we obtain a number density 04  104 Mpc3
and 09  104 Mpc3 for Bruzual  Charlot and Maraston
high-z models respectively again under the assumption of
no star formation activity at redshifts below 1 For refer-
ence the ultracompact densities in Cassata et al 2011 are
 22  104 Mpc3 at z  1  12
This seems to suggest that the density evolution of the ultra-
compact population has been stronger than that of the whole
compact population up to a factor between 25 and 5 Again
these are upper limits to the evolution assuming no star for-
mation at later times This is based on a morphologically se-
lected sample and it would be useful to repeat the comparison
with large high-z samples of ultracompact galaxies of all mor-
phological types as was done in the rest of the paper
It is also worth noticing that the most extreme compact
galaxies at high redshifts mostly lie at z  2 Cassata et al
2011 Cimatti et al 2012 P13 Fig 4 and are likely observed
soon after the end of their star formation activity Under
these conditions the passive evolution in mass we discussed
in 21 can be very strong on a short timescale A galaxy
forming the bulk of its stars at z  25 between z  2  22
and today will have lost 19-23 of its z  2  22 observed
mass Already at z  1 such galaxy will have lost 13-17
of its z  2  22 mass The effect could be much larger for
galaxies that stopped forming stars just before being observed
as passive at high redshift as suggested by the B13 results
In general passive mass evolution affects the comparison of
high- and low-z samples A stellar generation evolving pas-
sively since high-z by z  0 will have lost almost 50 of its
initial mass
The exact amount of mass evolution depends on the IMF
assumed on the epoch of major star formation and detailed
star formation history therefore is highly uncertain The ef-
fect will become more and more prominent as observations
approach the epoch when star formation stopped
We suggest that the extreme compactness of z  2 galaxies
and the very strong evolution between z  2 and z  1 might
be at least partially due to a fast passive evolution in mass
between z  2 and z  1
4 CONCLUSION
We place an upper limit to the evolution in the number den-
sity of passively evolving compact galaxies from high red-
shift to the nearby Universe We conclude that at most half
and possibly an even smaller fraction of the high-z population
has appreciably evolved in size A more precise estimate of
the amount of size evolution is hindered mainly by the uncer-
tainty in high-z galaxy mass estimates and by the difculty
to match exactly progenitors and descendants on the basis of
luminosity-weighted ages However even under conservative
assumptions our results do not demand a major evolution in
size for most of the compact high-z galaxies On the other
hand we nd that the amount of evolution may be stronger
upper limits between 2 and 5 for the most extreme ultra-
compact galaxies which represent a minority of the massive
and passive population at high-z A detailed comparison as
a function of galaxy mass and degree of compactness will be
feasible when the corresponding information becomes avail-
able for high-z samples

PM2GC number density values of compact galaxies at low redshifts with LW ages  than the lookback time to the corresponding redshift see text Values are
given both adopting the B13 compactness criterion that uses Bruzual  Charlot models at high-z and converting the high-z masses to Marastons models The
lower and upper values at each redshift were obtained varying the LW age by 1 Gyr
