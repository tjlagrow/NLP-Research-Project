Abstract The environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galax-
ies considerably best visible through the well-known morphology-density relation-
ship We study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies
for a sample of 3360 galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from
the SDSS in the redshift range 005  z  006 and analyse luminosity-weighted
age metallicity and a Fe ratio as function of environment and galaxy mass We
nd that on average 10 per cent of early-type galaxies are rejuvenated through mi-
nor recent star formation This fraction increases with both decreasing galaxy mass
and decreasing environmental density However the bulk of the population obeys
a well-dened scaling of age metallicity and a Fe ratio with galaxy mass that is
independent of environment Our results contribute to the growing evidence in the
recent literature that galaxy mass is the major driver of galaxy formation Even the
morphology-density relationship may actually be mass-driven as the consequence
of an environment dependent characteristic galaxy mass coupled with the fact that
late-type galaxy morphologies are more prevalent in low-mass galaxies
1 Introduction
The environment is known to be a major driver in the formation and evolution of
galaxies Its inuence is best visible through the well-known morphology-density
relationship according to which early-type galaxies and morphologically undis-
turbed galaxies are preferentially found in high density environments and vice versa

In contrast it is less clear whether the environment is equally important at a given
galaxy morphology There is still major controversy about whether the formation
and evolution of the most massive and morphologically most regular galaxies in
the universe ie early-type galaxies are affected by environmental densities We
analyse the stellar population parameters luminosity-weighted age metallicity and
a Fe element ratio of 3360 early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey 18 in a narrow redshift range 005  z  006 16 The SDSS provides
the opportunity to explore huge homogeneous samples of early-type galaxies in the
nearby universe comprising several ten thousands of objects so that a statistically

meaningful investigation of the stellar population parameters of galaxies and their
dependence on environment can be attempted This work is published in Thomas et
al 2010 and we refer the reader to this paper for more details 16 The galaxy
catalogue produced in this study can be found at wwwicgportacukthomasd
The sample utilised here is part of a project called MOSES MOrphologically
Selected Early-types in SDSS We have collected a magnitude limited sample of
48023 galaxies in the redshift range 005  z  01 with apparent r-band magni-
tude brighter than 168 from the SDSS Data Release 4 The most radical difference
with respect to other galaxy samples constructed from SDSS is our choice of purely
morphological selection of galaxy type through visual inspection 12 Building on
the success of this strategy our approach has been extended with the Citizen Science
Galaxy Zoo project to enable visual classication of even larger samples 6
For the estimate of the environmental density we calculate the local number den-
sity of objects brighter than a certain absolute magnitude in a 6 Mpc sphere around
the object of interest with a Gaussian weight function centred on the object ensures
to avoid contamination from neighbouring structures We compute stellar velocity
dispersion and measure emission line uxes which we use to produce a emission
line free galaxy spectrum with the public codes ppxf and GANDALF 2 11 We
measure Lick absorption-line indices on the spectra and derive luminosity-weighted
ages metallicities and a Fe ratios using the TMB stellar population models 14
by means of a minimised c 2 technique
We applied further selection criteria to the 16502 early-type galaxies in our cat-
alogue The redshift range sampled 005  z  01 is small and corresponds to a
time window of only  600 Myr Still this age difference produces signicant selec-
tion effects We therefore took a conservative approach and decided to focus on the
narrow redshift range 005  z  006 providing an acceptable coverage in veloc-
ity dispersion down to logs kms  19 This results in a total of 3360 early-type
galaxies
3 Results
The characteristic mass of a galaxy population increases with environmental density
1 indicating that lower density environments host less massive galaxies This mass
bias has to be eliminated for a meaningful study of the inuence of environment We
therefore investigate the environmental dependence of the correlations of the stellar
population properties with velocity dispersion s and galaxy mass
Fig 1 shows contour plots for the relationship between stellar velocity dispersion
and luminosity-weighted age for various environmental densities as indicated by the

Fig 1 Contour plots of the relationship between stellar velocity dispersion and luminosity-
weighted age for various environmental densities as indicated by the inset histograms The hor-
izontal dotted line separates an old red sequence population solid contours from rejuvenated ob-
jects in the blue cloud with light-averaged ages smaller than 25 Gyr dashed contours The solid
line is a linear t to the red sequence population the parameters of the t are given at the top of
each panel The dotted line is the t for all environmental densities parameters from top left-hand
panel The age-s
relationship for the red sequence population is independent of environment
while the rejuvenation fraction increases with decreasing density
inset histograms The distribution of ages is bimodal with a major peak at old ages
and a secondary peak at young ages around  25 Gyr in analogy to red sequence
and blue cloud identied in galaxy populations We call the objects below the
dotted line rejuvenated and the fraction of objects in this category rejuvenation
fraction The latter is about 10 per cent as indicated by the label in the gure
The ts to the red sequence population are repeated in every environment bin It
can be seen clearly from the plots that the resulting t parameters are consistent with
no variation as a function of environment within their 1-s error bars We conclude
there is no considerable change as a function of environmental density hence the
relationship is independent of environment The same is true for metallicity
and a Fe ratio 16
Very different is the behaviour of the blue cloud rejuvenated population In this
case the environment plays a role The rejuvenation fraction increases with decreas-
ing environmental density Hence early-type galaxies in lower density environments
are not generally younger at a given mass but the fraction of rejuvenated galax-

ies is higher Note however that again mass is the major driver for the fraction of
rejuvenated galaxies as shown in Thomas et al 2010 16
This environment-dependent rejuvenation process is most prevalent in low-mass
galaxies and entirely absent in the most massive objects Most importantly rejuve-
nation involves only minor star formation hence is negligible in terms of the overall
mass budget and occurs at late epochs As a consequence most of the galaxys stel-
lar populations form in an environment independent mode with galaxy mass as the
major driver for star formation and quenching processes
4 Discussion
In Thomas et al 2010 we investigate the effect of environmental density on the for-
mation epochs of early-type galaxies 16 The major conclusion is that it is galaxy
mass not environment that shapes the stellar population properties of early-type
galaxies Pre-SDSS studies of the stellar population parameters in early-type galax-
ies based on relatively small local samples consistently found younger average ages
in low density environments 5 15 The present sample based on SDSS is signi-
cantly larger and therefore less biased towards the local volume which may explain
the discrepancy with previous work The increase in sample size further implies a
higher statistical signicance of the results In fact most studies in the recent liter-
ature that are based on large samples from data bases such as the SDSS come to
similar conclusions 17 9 4 10 galaxy mass dominates over galaxy environment
In particular environment seems to be important mostly for low-mass galaxies and
only at late epochs 13 7
Based on a study of SDSS data van den Bosch 2008 show that the colours and
concentrations of satellite galaxies are determined by their stellar mass In particular
at xed stellar mass they nd the average colours and concentrations of satellite
galaxies to be independent of either halo mass or halo-centric radius 17 The only
ngerprint from the environment is that satellites appear to be redder older and
metal-richer than centrals of the same stellar mass a difference that increases with
decreasing galaxy mass 7 However they nd that the nature of the transformation
and quenching process experienced by a galaxy when it falls into a bigger halo is
independent of the size of this halo hence independent of environment 17
Peng et al 2010 use SDSS data to separate two distinct processes of mass-
quenching and environment-quenching that dominate the evolution of galaxies
9 They nd that the quenching of galaxies around and above M must follow a
rate that is statistically proportional to their star-formation rates and the latter tend
to scale with mass rather than with environment Peng et al 2010 conclude that
the environment acts through a once-only process as the environment of a given
galaxy changes while the mass-quenching process must be continuously operating
and be governed by a probabilistic transformation rate 9 Again this result implies
that environment only plays a secondary role in shaping the stellar populations of
galaxies and galaxy mass is the major driver of galaxy formation
And the winner is galaxy mass
5 Conclusions
The role and signicance of the environment for galaxy formation has been dis-
cussed highly controversially at the JENAM 2010 Symposium 2 Environment and
the Formation of Galaxies 30 years later It is exciting and intriguing that recent
work is about to lead to a converging picture despite some controversy in which
environment loses out over galaxy mass 30 years after the seminal work of Alan
Dressler on the morphology-density relationship 3 As it turned out at this meeting
however Alan Dressler has never regarded the morphology-density relation nec-
essarily as environment-driven It could actually be mass-driven being the conse-
quence of an environment dependent galaxy mass function the characteristic mass
of a galaxy population increases with environmental density coupled with the fact
that late-type galaxy morphologies are more prevalent in low-mass galaxies Galax-
ies are individualists and as Alan Dressler concluded at the meeting morphology
is destiny
