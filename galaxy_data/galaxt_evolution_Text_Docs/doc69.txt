introduction
The formation mechanism of the brightest cluster galax-
ies BCGs is an important problem of modern astronomy
eg Lin  Mohr 2004 von der Linden et al 2007 Hansen
et al 2007 Garijo Athanassoula  Garcia-Gomez 1997
Tutukov Dryumov  Dryumova 2007 The denition
of a BCG is based on the brightness contrast between
it and the other cluster members Some of BCGs are
cD galaxies which have characteristic faint and extended
halo The physical properties of these unique objects are
reviewed by Tonry 1987 Kormendy  Djorgovski 1989
and Schombert 1992
According to one of the proposed scenarios BCGs are
formed in the cluster cooling ows when the gas den-
sity grows enough to cool and condense forming stars in
the cluster core Silk 1976 Cowie  Binney 1977 Fabian
In this scenario there should be color gradients
which are absent Andreon et al 1992 Another proposed
possibility for formation of cDs involves tidal stripping by
cluster galaxies which pass near the cluster center The
stripped material falls to the center of the potential well
and may form the halo of the giant galaxy there Gallagher
 Ostriker 1972 Richstone 1975 1976 This theory can
not explain however the dierence between central dom-
inant galaxies in clusters with and without a prominent
halo Garijo Athanassoula  Garcia-Gomez 1997 men-
tion in addition that the velocity dispersion of stars in cD
halos is by three times smaller than the velocity dispersion
of galaxies in the cluster and so this theory has a diculty
in explaining why the tidally stripped material is slowed
down as it builds up a cD halo
The third hypotheses on formation of cDs is by rapid
merging of galaxies during cluster collapse eg Merritt
1983 19841985 Dubinski 1998 However as Merrit ar-
gues the truncation of galaxy halos during cluster collapse
should make time scales for dynamical friction longer than
a Hubble time and thus turn o subsequent evolution in
the cluster
Note that cD galaxies formed by the mentioned scenar-
ios should be located exactly in the center of correspond-
ing cluster and must have the mean radial velocity of the
cluster galaxies Meanwhile some cDs are located at ap-
preciably high distance from the geometrical center of the
cluster and have peculiar velocities in relation to the mean
cluster velocities of the order of 50-400 km s1 mentioned
by many eg Oegerle  Hill 2001 and references therein
This fact poses problems for the mentioned mechanisms of
formation of BCGs
The most popular hypothesis is the galactic cannibal-
ism Hausman  Ostriker 1978 Ostriker  Trimain 1975
White 1976 Baier  Schmidt 1992 showed that merg-
ing processes play an important role in the formation of
cDs According to this hypothesis massive cluster galax-
ies gradually sink to the bottom of the potential well of
a cluster and merge with each other Searle Sargent 
Bagnuolo 1973 Dressler 1980 Barnes 1989 Cannibalism
may also be responsible for the further growth of giant
galaxies formed by cooling ows or cluster collaps
In this paper I consider correlations between dierent
parameters of BCGs and of the clusters in which they re-
side Assuming the cannibalism scenario for formation of
BCGs I present evidences on their evolution In the study
the emphasis is given to the formation of cD galaxies in
clusters of Bautz-Morgan BM class I Bautz  Morgan
1970 since the performed analysis is simply applicable
namely to clusters with a single very bright monster It is
assumed that cD galaxies become brighter by a continuous
proccess of accretion of satellite galaxies
2 the data and analysis
21 The Data
For study the possible mechanism of formation of BCGs
I used the Abell Corwin  Ollowin ACO 1989 clus-
ters of BM class I which contain a single very bright
galaxy The performed inspection of images of these clus-
ters showed that clusters A447 A1508 A1775 A2025
mentioned as of BM type I in ACO do not contain a single
very bright galaxy Therefore they were excluded from the
compiled list Also I found that radial velocities of bright
galaxies in A1631 and A1654 dier signicantly from that
of the corresponding clusters So these clusters are not of
BM type I The compiled list consists of 53 BCGs of which
34 are classied in Struble  Rood 1987 as cD and 19
as B F etc
I determined absolute stellar magnitudes of BCGs us-
ing the Kstotal apparent magnitudes from 2MASS Jar-
rett et al 2000 which are more appropriate for the study
the BCGs since K magnitude encompasses the light of
the predominantly red population in early-type galaxies
Note that 2MASS magnitudes have problems eg Bell et
Tovmassian
al 2003 in detecting low surface brightness light such
as halos of cD galaxies eg Schombert 1988
dition Lauer et al
2007 demonstrated that 2MASS
photometry is likely to underestimate the total light from
BCGs At the same time Lauer et al
2007 showed
that 2MASS photometry is free from possible errors which
may be caused by the sky background substraction and
crowding The most important inconsistency may be pro-
duced by the extrapolation scheme to generate total mag-
nitudes Jarret et al 2000 Meanwhile Lin  Mohr
2004 used a correction scheme to extrapolate isophotal
magnitudes to total magnitudes and showed that both
schemes are consistent Summing up we may assume that
mentioned problems of 2MASS magnitudes may not intro-
duce systematic errors in our study Note that the 2MASS
magnitudes have been widely used in galactic studies eg
Temi Brighenti  Mathews 2008 Courteau et al 2007
Masters Springob  Huchra 2007 etc
The Mk absolute magnitudes were deduced using the
known redshifts of clusters Andernach et al 2005 in
which corresponding BCGs recide If the redshift of the
cluster was unknown the absolute magnitude was deter-
mined using the redshift of the galaxy itself given in the
NED NASA Extragalactic Database For distance de-
terminations H0  72 km s1 Mpc1 was adopted A
correction for the Galactic extinction was introduced ac-
cording to Schlegel Finkbeiner  Davis 1998 given in
NED and the K-correction according to Kochanek et al
2001

the consecutive columns of which the following data are

22 Formation and Evolution of cD galaxies
performed using the volume limited complete sample
In Fig 2 the distribution by redshift of cDs and BCGs
without halo classied as B L F C in Struble  Rood
1987 is presented Fig 2 shows the absence of galax-
ies without observed halo characteristic to cD galaxies at
small redshifts and their higher number at high redshifts
One may assume that BCGs in all clusters of BM class I
are mostly of cD type the supposed halo of which is not
detectable at high distances Remember that as Sandage
1994 showed the surface brightness SB of a galaxy de-
pends very strongly on the distance SB  11  z4
Therefore for study the formation of BCGs the common
sample of cDs and other BCGs named further on as cDs
is considered
Fig 1 demonstrates a peculiar distribution of cDs by
redshift The luminosity of the brightest cDs increases
gradually with increase of redshift z At the same time
contrary to Malmquist bias the luminosity of the faintest
cDs somewhat increases with decrease of redshift I show
below that such peculiar dependence of the luminosity on
z may be explained assuming that cDs are evolving due to
cannibalism
If cDs are formed by cannibalism they will be brighter
in rich clusters since the probability of encounter and
merging obviously depend on the number of galaxies in
a cluster Indeed the richer is a cluster the more mem-
bers may be cannibalized by the forming cD in the po-
tential well of the cluster and the brighter will be the
formed cD The richness of a cluster is generally char-
acterized by the Abell number count NA For estima-
tion of the total number of galaxies within Abell radius
we have to take into account the galaxies which already
merged to the central monster We may estimate the num-
ber Nm of merged galaxies assuming that they are ordi-
nary galaxies For the absolute magnitude of the latter
I used Mkisol  22m68 found by Tovmassian Plio-
nis  Andernach 2004 for an isolated ES0 or spiral
galaxies The number Nm of merged galaxies is deter-
mined by the formula Nm  antilogMk  Mkisol25
If cDs are formed in the result of cannibalism the faintest
cD with Mk  26m was formed by merging of about
21 galaxies with a mean brightness of an isolated ES0
galaxy The brightest cDs with Mk equal to about 28m
are formed then by merging of about 130 ordinary ES0 or
spiral galaxies Adding the number Nm of merged galax-
ies to the Abell number count NA we estimate the initial
number Ni of galaxies within one Abell radius before the
start of merging In total the initial number of galaxies in
corresponding clusters was determined for 38 cDs of the
volume limited complete sample The number of merged
galaxies and consequently the initial number of the cluster
members was not determined for cDs located in clusters
A85 A1177 and A2029 which according to Andernach et
al 2005 consist of separate projected clusters the Abell
number count of which is thus uncertain
The distribution of Mk absolute magnitudes of BCGs
against redshift in clusters of BM class I is shown in Fig
1 The dotted lines show the locus of absolute mag-
nitudes of galaxies the Kstotal apparent magnitudes of
which are equal to 9m0 and 14m0 respectively For draw-
ing these lines the K-correction Kochanek et al 2001 to
apparent magnitudes was applied All observed cDs and
BCGs located within these two lines represent a complete
sample The absence of BCGs to the right of the line
Kstotal  14m0 is caused by selection eect fainter ob-
jects are not detected Fig 1 shows that the sample of 41
BCGs is volume limited up to z  01622 Objects marked
by open circle are outside the limiting distance of the vol-
ume limited sample of BCGs The further discussion is
1 the Abell number count NA is the number of galaxies more luminous than m32 mag where m3 is the apparent photored magnitude of
the third most luminous cluster member located within one Abell radius Rc of the cluster center NA values are taken from Struble  Rood
1987 who adopted for Rc the apparent cluster radius estimated by Leir  van den Berg 1977 or otherwise estimated by Abell 1980 and
converted to Leir  van den Berg system
Fig 3 shows that there is a very strong corelation be-
tween the initial number Ni of galaxies and the absolute
magnitude Mk of the formed cD expected in the case of
cD galaxies

Fig 3 The dependence of the absolute magnitude Mk of a cD galaxy on initial number Ni of galaxies in cluster
formation of cDs by cannibalism Note however that
Ni  Mk correlation may be expected also when cDs are
formed by rapid merging of galaxies during cluster col-
During permanent process of cannibalism the number
Nm of cannibalized galaxies by the cD galaxy obviously
will increase in time Therefore one may expect that
Nm of galaxies cannibalized by older cDs in nearby space
will be higher than cannibilazed by distant younger ones
However the supposed increase of the number of merged
galaxies will be strongly masked by the following As we
saw the brightness of the cD strongly depends on the ini-
tial number Ni of galaxies in parent cluster Fig 3 On
the other hand the richness of a cluster depends on the dis-
tance It is known that the farther is the cluster the richer
it is Abell 1958 The richness-distance dependence of the
used sample of cDs is presented in Fig 4 Note that the
richness of the rich clusters sharply decreases with decrease
of distance while for the poorest clusters this decrease is
very slow Hence the farther is the cluster generally the
richer it is and the brighter will be the cD galaxy formed
In order to overcome the diculty to detect possible
evolution of cDs I compared the mean relative number
Nr  NmNi of merged galaxies in small groups of cDs
with small range of absolute magnitudes Mk The sam-
ple of 38 cDs with estimated Nr ratio was ordered by in-
creasing Mk and were divided into groups consisting of
six galaxies each Then the faintest galaxy from the rst
group was deleted and new groups of six galaxies were
composed This procedure was repeated ve times At
the end the list of 33 independent groups consisting each
of 6 galaxies with small range of absolute magnitudes was
compiled Replacement of one galaxy in a group of six
galaxies resulted in dierent brightness and redshift lim-
its and also the dierent median redshift of the group
Therefore all sets of six galaxies in the compiled six sam-
ples are independent Then the mean relative numbers Nr
and corresponding dispersion for three nearby and three
far galaxies in each group were determined The results on
the composed 33 independent groups are presented in Ta-
ble 2 The highest dierence Mk of absolute magnitudes
of galaxies in each set of groups is also shown
Inspection of Table 2 shows that in one group group 4
in sample 4 the mean ratio Nr for groups of nearby and
far galaxies is the same in seven groups groups 2 3 4 in
sample 1 group 3 in sample 2 groups 3 and 4 in sample
3 and group 3 in sample 4 the mean ratio Nr is high for
far galaxies In the other 25 groups the mean ratio Nr is
higher for nearby galaxies Though the dierence between
the mean Nr of nearby and far galaxies in some groups is
not high in comparison to corresponding dispersion the
Tovmassian
Fig 4 The dependence of the initial number Ni of galaxies in cluster on redshift
probability that in 25 out of 33 groups the mean Nr ratio
for nearby galaxies will be by chance higher than that of
for far galaxies is extremly small P  6  107 Note that
NA for far clusters may be underestimated Therefore
the estimated ratio Nr for far clusters may in fact be even
smaller This shows with certainty that nearby cDs in each
group ie the older ones cannibalized more cluster mem-
bers than younger cDs in more distant clusters with about
the same richness Hence the performed analysis shows
that in spite of the increase of the richness of clusters with
redshift Fig 4 and the corresponding increase of bright-
ness with cluster richness Fig 3 the number of merged
galaxies in the samples of cDs with about the same bright-
ness increases with decrease of redshift It means that cDs
in clusters of BM type I grow in time They eat more
cluster members during their life The obtained results
are in favor of the suggestion that cDs are formed by the
mechanism of cannibalism and are evolving
In the result of cannibalization of cluster members cD
galaxies become brighter in time and move up on the di-
agram of Fig 1 This process for cDs in rich clusters
will last relatively long time for two reasons At rst the
rich and massive clusters have high velocity dispersion v
see Fig 5 and for this reason the merging process in
them will be slow And at second for the large stock
Ni of candidate galaxies for merging Thus cDs in rich
clusters slowely move up forming the upper envelope of
the distribution of the cD brightness against z Fig 1
In poor clusters with small v the rate of merging is ob-
viously higher than in rich clusters At the same time
the resources of galaxies for merging are small Therefore
the process of cannibalism in poor clusters may terminate
faster
In relatively short time there will be very little
amount of galaxies in poor clusters to be eaten by the
forming cD and they shortly will reach their possible not
high brightness And the older is the formed cD the more
galaxies it cannibalized and the brighter it will be This
is demonstrated by the lower envelope of the distribution
in Fig 1 Note that the initial number Ni of the poorest
groups gradually increases with redshift Fig 4 There-
fore since the brightness of the formed cD depends on the
richness of the cluster the opposite trend should be ob-
served ie the brightness of cDs in poorest clusters will
increase with redshift This obviously decreases the found
trend of increase of the brightness of the poorest cDs with
decrease of redsift which in reality will be stronger than
the observed one Thus the suggested scenario explains
the upper and lower envelopes of distribution of Mk of cDs
against z demonstrated in Fig 1 Described scenario of
evolution of cD galaxies explains the peculiar luminosity
function of cD galaxies presented in Lopes-Cruz Tovmas-
sian  Mendes de Oliveira 2008
23 Fossil groups
Fossil groups t well with the scenario of evolution of
cD galaxies by cannibalism Vikhlinin et al 1999 and
Mulchaey  Zabludo 1999 expressed an idea that fossil
groups could be formed by complete merging of galaxies
within once normal clusters In Fig 6 we present distribu-
tions Mk  log z for the complete sample of cDs in clusters
of BM class I and for the brightest galaxies in fossil groups
for the same distance limit We used the list of the fossils
compiled by Santos Mendes de Oliveira  Sodre 2007
Fig 6 shows that almost all fossil groups are among faint
cDs It means that the initial number of galaxies in the
primordial fossil clusters was small As generally in poor
clusters after merging of some number of galaxies there
will be almost no more galaxies left for merging with the
bright galaxy and the cluster will become a fossil group
3 conclusions
I present evidences that cDs in clusters of galaxies of BM
class I are formed by the mechanism of cannibalism The
process of cannibalism in a cluster is a permanent one In
rich clusters more galaxies may merge in time to the cen-
tral monster and the brightness of the latter may grow to
very high value The process of cannibalism in rich clus-
ters is a relatively long lasting one for small rate of merging
high velocity dispersion and large number of galaxies in
the cluster The cDs formed in rich clusters determine the
upper envelope of the cD brightness distribution by red-
shift Fig 1 The cDs formed in poor clusters may be
not very bright for small stock of galaxies The process of
cannibalism in poor clusters terminates faster rst for the
high rate of merging small velocity dispersion and sec-
ond for the small number of galaxies for merging Nearby
older cDs have eaten more cluster members in compar-
ison to cDs in distant younger clusters with about the
cD galaxies

same richness Old cDs in nearby poor clusters already
reached their possible high brightness The older is the
cD the brighter it is This determines the peculiar lower
envelope of the cD brightness distribution Fig 1 In the
frames of this scenario fossil groups are those poor clus-
ters in which the process of cannibalism already nished
due to the small stock of galaxies in the system and the
brightness of the central monster practically reached its
possible high value
