ABSTRACT
Context The gravitational lensing eect provides various ways to study the mass environment of galaxies
AimsWe investigate how galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing can be used to test models of galaxy formation and evolution
Methods We consider two semi-analytic galaxy formation models based on the Millennium Run N-body simulation the Durham
model by Bower et al 2006 and the Garching model by Guo et al 2011 We generate mock lensing observations for the two
models and then employ Fast Fourier Transform methods to compute second- and third-order aperture statistics in the simulated
elds for various galaxy samples
Results We nd that both models predict qualitatively similar aperture signals but there are large quantitative dierences The
Durham model predicts larger amplitudes in general In both models red galaxies exhibit stronger aperture signals than blue galaxies
Using these aperture measurements and assuming a linear deterministic bias model we measure relative bias ratios of red and blue
galaxy samples We nd that a linear deterministic bias is insucient to describe the relative clustering of model galaxies below ten
arcmin angular scales Dividing galaxies into luminosity bins the aperture signals decrease with decreasing luminosity for brighter
galaxies but increase again for fainter galaxies This increase is likely an artifact due to too many faint satellite galaxies in massive
group and cluster halos predicted by the models
Conclusions Our study shows that galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing is a sensitive probe of galaxy evolution

1 Introduction
Gravitational lensing eects provide versatile tools for probing
the matter distribution in the Universe Galaxy-galaxy lensing
GGL for example is a statistical approach using lensing to
obtain information on the mass associated with individual galax-
ies see eg Bartelmann  Schneider 2001 This is achieved
by dividing the galaxy population into lenses foreground and
sources background The images of the sources are sheared
due to the gravitational eld of the foreground lenses and their
surrounding mass The image shearing is usually too small to
be detected for individual source-lens galaxy pairs Instead the
lensing eect is measured as a correlation between the observed
image ellipticities and the lens positions The signal obtained
from averaging over many source-lens pairs can then be related
to the average mass proles of the lenses
Since its rst detection Brainerd et al 1996 GGL has
been measured in many large galaxy surveys eg Hoekstra
et al 2002 Kleinheinrich et al 2006 Mandelbaum et al 2006
Simon et al 2008 van Uitert et al 2011 and references therein
Schneider  Watts 2005 advanced GGL to galaxy-galaxy-
galaxy lensing G3L by introducing third-order correlation
functions that involve either congurations with two background
 or with two lenses and one
sources and one lens galaxy G

background source G The latter measures the lensing signal
around pairs of lens galaxies in excess of what one obtains by
simply adding the average signals of two individual galaxies
and thus provides a measure of the excess matter prole about
clustered lens galaxy pairs Simon et al 2012 This G3L signal
has been measured in the Red sequence Cluster Survey RCS
Gladders  Yee 2005 by Simon et al 2008 who indeed found
an excess mass about lens pairs with projected separation of
250h1 kpc The GGGL correlations can be converted to aper-
ture statistics which we utilize in this work providing a conve-
nient probe of the galaxy-matter powerbi-spectra at particular
scales
The galaxy-mass correlation as seen by weak lensing can
also be studied theoretically by combining dark matter simu-
lations with semi-analytic models SAM of galaxy evolution
White  Frenk 1991 Kaumann et al 1999 Springel et al
2001 In this approach the dark matter halos of an N-body sim-
ulation of cosmic structure formation are populated with galax-
ies The properties of the galaxies are calculated by combining
information on the halo merger trees of the underlying dark mat-
ter simulation with an analytic model of the gas physics in galax-
ies The physical processes considered include gas cooling star
formation metal enrichment and feedback due to supernovae
and active galactic nuclei Using ray-tracing eg Hilbert et al
2009 one can then simulate lensing observations of the result-
ing galaxy distribution
Saghiha et al Galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing as a sensitive probe of galaxy evolution
This paper provides a study of the second- and third-order
galaxy-mass correlations in semi-analytic galaxy formation
models as probed by lensing via aperture statistics Schneider
1996 Schneider et al 1998 We consider two models based on
the Millennium Run Springel et al 2005 the Durham model
by Bower et al 2006 and the Garching model by Guo et al
2011 We nd that the predicted second- and third-order lens-
ing signals dier between galaxies of dierent color and mag-
nitude but also between the dierent galaxy models The dif-
ferences between the models can be traced back to among other
things dierent treatments of the satellite galaxy evolution This
illustrates that galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing can be a sensitive
probe of galaxy evolution
The outline of the paper is as follows Sect 2 provides a brief
account of gravitational lensing aperture statistics and their re-
lation to correlation functions Our lensing simulations and the
method we use to measure aperture statistics a fast method
based on Fast Fourier Transforms are described in Sect 3 The
results of these measurements for dierent subsets of galaxies
dened by redshift luminosity or color are presented in Sect 4
The main part of the paper concludes with a summary and dis-
cussion in Sect 5 In the appendix we briey discuss shot-noise
corrections for the aperture statistics

matter density contrast m by the projection along the line-of-

22 ApertureStatistics
Aperture statistics was originally introduced as a way to quantify
the surface mass density that is unaected by the mass sheet
degeneracy Schneider 1996 The aperture mass is dened as a
convolution
Map  Z d2 U   m
of the convergence  and an axi-symmetric lter U whose
size is given by the scale  and that is compensated ie
Z d  U  0

A more realistic assumption is that the galaxy bias is stochas-
tic and depends on the time and spatial scale At the two-point
level the bias may then be quantied by a scale-dependent bias
factor and correlation factor A description of the relation be-
tween the galaxy and matter densities at the three-point level or
higher requires additional higher-order bias and correlation pa-
rameters
Aperture statistics can be used to constrain the galaxy bias

If the measured ratios of the aperture statistics change with
scale  one can extend the idea to a measurement of a scale-
dependent bias For lens galaxy samples with narrow redshift
distributions and deterministic bias the above ratios still agree
roughly when compared on the same scales If the galaxy bias
is stochastic or non-linear Dekel  Lahav 1999 however the
ratios from the dierent statistics disagree even if measured on
the same scale In that case the second- and third-order aperture
statistics each contain valuable independent information on the
second- and third-order bias of the galaxies Schneider  Watts

Clusters and galaxies are biased tracers of the matter distribu-
tion Kaiser 1984 Bardeen et al 1986 Mo et al 1996 In the
simplest conceivable non-trivial bias model the bias can be ex-
pressed as a linear deterministic relation between the galaxy den-
sity contrast and the matter density contrast
3 Methods
31 Lensingsimulations
For our analysis we use the data obtained by ray-tracing through
the Millennium Run Springel et al 2005 The Millennium Run
MR is a large N-body simulation of structure formation in a at
CDM universe with matter density m  025 baryon density
b  0045 dark-energy density   075 a Hubble con-
stant H0  h100km s1Mpc1 with h  073 and with a power
spectrum normalization 8  09 It follows the evolution of
Np  1010 dark matter particles with mass mp  86108h1 M
in a cubic region of comoving side length 500h1 Mpc from red-
shift z  127 to the present
The simulation volume of the MR is large enough to in-
clude massive rare objects yet with suciently high spatial and
mass resolution to resolve dark matter halos of galaxies This
allows the construction of merger trees of dark matter halos
and subhalos within them These merger trees have been used
in various semi-analytic galaxy formation models to calculate
the properties of galaxies in the simulation Here we consider
the Durham model by Bower et al 2006 and the Garching
model by Guo et al 20111 Both models have similar treat-
ments of eg gas cooling and star formation but dier in var-
ious details see the original papers for a full description The
models have been adjusted to be consistent with a large num-
ber of observations in particular the luminosities stellar masses

with a bias factor bgm that does not depend on time or scale but
only on the galaxy sample in question
1 We also considered an earlier incarnation of the Garching model
by De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 However the dierences between the
results from two Garching models are minor Thus we concentrate the
discussion on the models by Bower et al 2006 and Guo et al 2011

tion through the matter in the MR We generate 64 simulated
4  4 deg2 elds of view For each eld we calculate the con-
vergence to sources at a number of redshifts on a regular mesh
of 40962 pixels as well as the apparent sky positions redshifts
and magnitudes of the model galaxies from the Garching and
Durham models The galaxy properties are then used to select
various subsamples of the full mock galaxy catalogs as lens pop-
ulations for the GGGL

32 Computingaperturestatistics
We introduce a fast method to perform aperture statistics mea-
surements on the 64 simulated elds The statistic used here is
built on two main components i the pixelized convergence
eld m of the source galaxies on square meshes of 40962
pixels and ii the pixelized lens galaxy number density elds on
meshes with the same geometry The convergence elds are ob-
tained directly from the ray-tracing algorithm The galaxy den-
sity elds are obtained by projecting the apparent position of the
lens galaxies in the elds and counting the number of galaxies in
each pixel Finally dividing by the mean number density of lens
galaxies across all 64 elds results in the galaxy number density
contrast g
We calculate the aperture statistics Map  and N 
from m and g on a grid by exploiting the convolution theo-
rem using Fast Fourier Transforms FFT in particular the FFTW
library by Frigo  Johnson 2005 to carry out the convolu-
tion in Eqs 9 and 15 To measure Map or N we calcu-
late the Fourier transforms of m or g and U We then
multiply the results in the Fourier space Finally an inverse
Fourier transformation gives Map or N The number of grid
points in the eld is nite 40964096 pixels Therefore a
Discrete Fourier Transform is performed by using the Fast
Fourier Transform FFT algorithm which reduces an ON2 pro-
cess to ON log2 N with N being the number of points being
Fourier transformed Hence FFT reduces the computation time
immensely
Since Map  and N  elds are not periodic we ex-
clude points closer than 4 to the eld edges from the subsequent
analysis On the remaining points we then calculate N 2 
N Map  and N 2 Map  and estimatecid10N 2cid11
cid10N Mapcid11 andcid10N 2Mapcid11 from these products by spatial av-
eraging We correct the estimates involving N 2 for shot noise as
described in Appendix A
The G3L statistics can also be calculated from the shear eld
corresponding to m and the positions of the lens galaxies In
particular Schneider  Watts 2005 and Simon et al 2008
point correlation function 3PCF In order to check our proce-
dure we use 32 randomly selected simulated elds and calculate

3PCF with the help of a tree code We note that while this tree
method is more exible than the simple FFT-based method de-

Average dierence signal between the FFT method and the tree
method Again the error bars show the standard deviation of the
mean eld variance of dierence signal divided by 31
scribed above in particular with regard to eld boundaries and
gaps it is also considerably slower
For some of the individual elds we nd fairly large discrep-
ancies between the results from the FFT and the tree method  in
particular for elds with a large matter overdensity near the eld
boundaries We can attribute these discrepancies to the dier-
ent ways in which the three-point information is weighted in the
two approaches For example a triplet of points near the bound-
ary of the eld enters the statistics in the tree method with the
same weight as a similar triplet near the eld center In contrast
the FFT method by excluding the stripe at the eld boundary
assigns zero weight to such a triple Hence the results on indi-
vidual elds can be quite dierent
Both methods are consistent however when averaging the
results over many elds Randomly selecting 32 simulated elds
we measure cid10N 2Mapcid11 using the FFT method and the tree
method In the upper panel of Fig 1 the outcomes of the two
methods are compared showing good agreement between the re-
sults The error bars indicating the statistical error on the signal
tend to be smaller for the tree method than for the FFT method
for apertures larger than 2 arcmin since the tree method makes
better use of the elds area For example for apertures larger
than 20 arcmin more than half of the eld is not included in
the FFT measurement Consequently the dierence in scatter
becomes more prominent on larger scales The lower panel in
Fig 1 shows the eld-by-eld dierence signal averaged over
all elds The dierence between the methods is consistent with
zero for   1 arcmin but deviates from zero for   1 arcmin
This is due to a systematic underestimation of the signal in the
tree method on small scales Simon et al 2008

In this section we present results for the second- and third-order
aperture cross-correlations and aperture number count disper-
sion for the Durham and the Garching model in the 64 sim-
ulated elds created from the Millennium Run For simplicity
the background population is chosen to be located at z  099
Unless stated otherwise lens galaxies are selected to have red-
shifts 014  z  062 observer-frame r-band apparent magni-
tude mr  225 and stellar masses M  109h1 M
 This yields
85106 lens galaxies in the Durham model and 87106 galax-
ies in the Garching model The resulting redshift distributions for
the lens populations are shown in Fig 2
For this sample of galaxies the aperture number count dis-
persion cid10N 2cid11 as a function of aperture radius is shown in the
top panel of Fig 3 The galaxy models clearly dier in the pre-
dicted dispersion the Durham model predicts an up to two times
larger amplitude than the Garching model A similar dierence
has been observed for the angular galaxy correlation function
by Kim et al 2009 who attribute the discrepancy to too many
bright satellites in the Durham model However as will be dis-
cussed below the Garching model also appears to suer from
problems with the modeling of the satellite population

by the sum of two Gaussian functions representing red and blue
subpopulations of galaxies on the red and blue side of the color
distribution respectively
Following observations eg Mandelbaum et al 2006 we
split the main lens galaxy samples at observer-frame color u  r

the Durham model we obtain 24106 red and 61106 blue
galaxies compared to 4106 red and 47106 blue galaxies in
the Garching model The redshift distributions of the color sub-
samples are shown in Fig4 The histograms show that the rela-
tive numbers of red and blue galaxies in each redshift bin dier
signicantly between the models
The aperture statistics for these red and blue galaxy popu-
lations in both models are shown in the left panels of Fig 5
In both models red galaxies show higher signals than the blue
galaxies This trend is not surprising since galaxies of dierent
types follow dierent distribution patterns and clustering proper-
ties Red galaxies are expected to be found mainly in groups and
clusters associated with strong clustering and large halo masses
whereas blue galaxies are mostly eld galaxies with smaller ha-
los and lower clustering The plot also shows that galaxies in
the two models show dierent clustering statistics in both red
and blue populations This may be a result of selecting dierent
objects in the models
Studying the previous version of the Garching model based
on the De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 Bett 2012 pointed out that
the distributions of the observer-frame u  r colors are very dif-
ferent in the Garching model and the Durham model In partic-
ular galaxies appear redder in the Garching model than in the
Durham model We thus consider another way of dividing the
galaxies into red and blue samples We identify the minima of
the bimodal distributions at each redshift The positions of the
minima are plotted in Fig 6 clearly showing a large dierence
between the models in their color distribution We then use the
minima to separate red and blue galaxies
Fig 7 shows the resulting redshift distributions of the red
and blue subsamples There are 42106 red and 43106 blue
galaxies in the Durham model compared to 25106 red and
62106 blue galaxies in the Garching model Now the dier-
ence between the models in the predicted numbers of red and
blue galaxies is larger than for the case of a xed color cut
This suggests that the redshift-dependent color cut selects very
dierent objects in the two models Surprisingly the aperture
statistics predicted by the two models are much more similar for
the redshift-dependent color cuts than for the xed color cut as
seen in the middle column of Fig 5 The better agreement results
from a decrease in the blue signals in the Durham model and an
increase in the red signals in the Garching model
The agreement between the two models shown in the middle
column of Fig 5 indicates that although the redshift distribu-
tions of red and blue galaxies dier galaxies populate dark mat-
ter halos in such a way to produce similar results This agree-
ment between the models is more prominently seen in cid10N 2cid11
and cid10N 2Mapcid11 Looking at cid10N Mapcid11 red Durham galaxies show
a stronger signal on intermediate scales compared to the red
Garching galaxies This can happen for example if red galax-
ies in the Durham model are mostly central galaxies populating
large massive halos On the other hand this dierence may also
be a result of the distinct redshift distributions As will discussed
this dierence is not seen when galaxies are restricted to come
from a single redshift
Selecting lens galaxies at a single redshift amplies the sig-
nal for cid10N 2cid11 and cid10N 2Mapcid11 compared to a sample with a broad
redshift distribution where many of the projected galaxy pairs
are at dierent redshifts and are therefore not correlated and
suppress the overall signal The third column of Fig 5 displays
the aperture measurements for lens galaxy populations selected
from a single redshift slice around z  017 with thickness
z  002 Now the signals for red galaxies agree well between
the two models The agreement is not so good for blue model

galaxies where the Garching model shows stronger signals on
small and intermediate scales In the halo-model language blue
Garching model galaxies at this redshift appear to live in more
massive halos
Both the Durham and the Garching models predict a larger
ratio between the clustering strength of red and blue galaxies
than has been obtained in observations A similar behavior was
seen when considering the previous incarnation of the Garching
model based on De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 In particular our
results conrm the previous work of de la Torre et al 2011
who compared the color-dependent projected two-point correla-
tion function of a color subsample of galaxies in the VIMOS-
VLT Deep Survey VVDS Le Fevre et al 2005 and in the
model based on De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 They showed that
red galaxies in the semi-analytic models have stronger clustering
amplitudes than the observed ones They linked this discrepancy
to an overproduction of bright red galaxies in the model
The dierent clustering strengths of red and blue galaxies
show up very clearly incid10N 2cid11cid10N Mapcid11 andcid10N 2Mapcid11 The ratio

to their relative bias Sect 23 This ratio can be measured based
on dierent aperture statistics measurements presented in Fig 5
Assuming a simple linear deterministic bias the relative bias and
its uncertainty is calculated on aperture scales of   1 arcmin
and   10 arcmin in the Garching and Durham models The
results are shown in Tab 1

The dierences in the bias ratios measured from dierent
statistics point out that a linear deterministic bias model is not
sucient to describe the relation between the galaxy and matter
distribution on dierent scales This relation may be described
by scale-dependent stochastic bias

In this section we present the measurements of the second- and
third-order aperture statistics for lens galaxies in six dierent
bins of r-band absolute observer frame magnitude Mr To elim-
inate eects of possibly dierent redshift distributions on the
signals we restrict the redshift range of the lens galaxy popu-
lation to one redshift slice at z  017 The results for all magni-
tude bins for the Garching Durham model are shown in the left
right panels of Fig 8
There are common trends seen for both models in the
second- and third-order aperture statistics For the brighter bins
23  Mr  20 the aperture signals decrease rapidly with in-
creasing magnitude Mr and lter scales  However the Durham
model predicts up to 200 higher cid10N 2Mapcid11 and cid10N 2cid11 signals
than the Garching model Bright galaxies appear more clus-
tered and on average to be located in more massive halos in the
Durham model
For the fainter bins 20  Mr  18 the signals in-
crease with decreasing luminosity This increase is contrary to
observations of galaxy clustering and GGL see eg McBride
et al 2011 where brighter galaxies show stronger clustering
and larger lensing signals than fainter galaxies
In the Garching model the faint magnitude bins are over-
populated with satellite galaxies many of which have no own
subhalo this occurs when a galaxy has been stripped of its own
halo during a merger process with a larger halo These galax-
ies are abundant in massive halos which contribute substantially
modeling of the satellite population in massive halos
stronger clustering In the Durham model a similar trend is seen
to thecid10N Mapcid11 andcid10N 2Mapcid11 signal due to their large mass and
in cid10N Mapcid11 and cid10N 2Mapcid11 indicating similar problems with the
The luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering has been
studied extensively with the aid of galaxy surveys Li et al
2007 compared the luminosity dependence of the clustering
of galaxies in the model of Croton et al 2006 to results from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Four SDSS DR4
Adelman-McCarthy et al 2006 and found that the faint model
galaxies show a stronger clustering than SDSS galaxies
Kim et al 2009 compared the galaxy clustering predicted
by the models of Bower et al 2006 De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
and Font et al 2008 to observed clustering in the two-degree
Field Galaxy Redshift Survey 2dF Colless et al 2001 They
found that none of the models are able to match the observed
clustering properties of galaxies in dierent luminosity bins In
particular the Durham model shows a stronger signal than ex-
pected which could possibly be corrected if the number of satel-
lite galaxies in halos is reduced
Both Li et al 2007 and Kim et al 2009 emphasize the
problems of the galaxy models in predicting the luminosity de-
pendence of galaxy clustering Li et al 2007 showed that the
number of faint satellite galaxies has to be reduced by 30 per
cent regardless of their host halo mass to better match the
observed galaxy clustering Kim et al 2009 showed that the
fraction of satellites declines with increasing luminosity see
eg Fig 4 in Kim et al 2009 in the host halo mass range of
1012h1 M
 Since the clustering strength
depends strongly on the halo mass satellite galaxies can aect
the overall clustering amplitude To investigate this they used a
simple HOD model to show that satellite galaxies show a strong
bias due to a strong two-halo clustering term This indicates that
satellite galaxies are preferentially found in massive halos which
exhibits larger bias see Fig 5 in Kim et al 2009 They argued
that the results can be improved if the satellites are removed from
massive halos by adding satellite-satellite merger processes in
the models
  Mhalo  1014h1 M
Our results suggest that the Garching model shows a similar
problem with faint satellite galaxies though to a lesser degree
Indeed we nd that the amplitude of the aperture signals in the
faint bins are completely dominated by satellite galaxies in both
the Durham and the Garching model Most of these faint satel-
lites reside in massive group and cluster halos which results in
very large aperture signals on the scales considered in this work
5 Summary and discussion
Through observations of galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing valu-
able information on the clustering properties of the galaxy
and matter density eld in the Universe can be obtained
Measurements of galaxy-galaxy lensing GGL can be used to
infer information on the properties of dark matter halos host-
ing the lens galaxies see eg Schneider  Rix 1997 Johnston

2008 2012
In this work we study how the information from GGL and
G3L aperture statistics can be used to test models of galaxy for-
mation and evolution We investigate two semi-analytic galaxy
formation models based on the Millennium Run N-body simu-
lation of structure formation Springel et al 2005 the Durham
model by Bower et al 2006 and the Garching model by Guo
et al 2011 Using mock galaxy catalogs based on these models
in conjunction with ray-tracing Hilbert et al 2009 we create
simulated elds of galaxy lensing surveys From these simulated
surveys we compute the model predictions for the second- and
various galaxy populations
third-order aperture statistics cid10N 2cid11 cid10N Mapcid11 and cid10N 2Mapcid11 for
We nd that both semi-analytic models predict aperture sig-
nals that are qualitatively similar but there are large quantitative
dierences The Durham model predicts larger amplitudes for
most considered galaxy samples This indicates that lens galax-
ies in the Durham model tend to reside in more massive halos
than lens galaxies in the Garching model
In both the Durham and the Garching model red galaxies ex-
hibit stronger aperture signals than blue galaxies in qualitative
agreement with observations However both models predict a
larger ratio between the clustering strength of red and blue galax-
ies than has been obtained in observations These ndings cor-
roborate the ndings of de la Torre et al 2011 who showed that
red galaxies in the semi-analytic models have stronger cluster-
ing amplitudes than red galaxies in observations We argue that
considering the amplitude ratio between the red and blue galax-
ies and making comparison between the second- and third-order
aperture statistics leads to the conclusion that the third-order
bias diers from the second-order bias In other words third-
order aperture statistics provides new information which cannot
be obtained from the second-order statistics alone The large am-
plitude ratio between the clustering of red and blue galaxies in
the models means a large relative bias of these galaxy popula-
tions Measuring the biasing of galaxies provides information
on the relative distribution of galaxies and the underlying mat-
ter distribution We nd that a linear deterministic bias model
even with scale-dependent bias parameters is clearly ruled out
by considering second and third-order aperture statistics for the
simulated data We expect that both statistics in combination will
provide new information to constrain more advanced galaxy bi-
asing models in the future
In addition to the dierent prediction for red and blue galax-
ies there are discrepancies between the predictions of the two
models For a xed color cut at u  r  22 the signals pre-
dicted by the Durham model are larger than those predicted by
the Garching model If a redshift-dependent color cut is used in-
stead the prediction from the two models for the aperture signals
become more similar However the models then strongly dis-
agree about the total numbers and redshift distributions of blue
and red galaxies
Both galaxy models predict that the aperture statistics de-
crease with decreasing luminosity for brighter galaxies in accor-
dance with observations However the models also predict that
the signals increase again for fainter galaxies This behavior is
most likely an artifact related to too many faint satellite galax-
ies in massive group and cluster halos predicted by the models
In fact the fainter magnitude bins are completely dominated by
satellite galaxies in both models The problem appears more se-
vere in the Durham model than in the Garching model which
dier in their treatment of satellite evolution
We plan to extent our treatment in future work to study how
well galaxy bias models with scale-dependent stochastic bias
can be constrained with second- and third-order galaxy lensing
statistics One important question is how much information can
be obtained from G3L in addition to that obtained from GGL
Furthermore we are looking forward to measurements of
GGL and G3L signals in large ongoing and future surveys The
comparison of the observed signals and the signals predicted by
galaxy models will help to identify shortcomings of the models
and provide valuable hints for improvements in the models This
will also require a deeper understanding of the relation between
the various details of the galaxy formation models and the pre-
dicted galaxy lensing and clustering signals

By projecting the galaxy positions of a realization onto a mesh eg using
Nearest-Grind-Point assignment one obtains a discretized representation of the
density estimate A2 The density estimate on the mesh can then be convolved
eg by using FFTs with the lters U and U2 to obtain gridded versions of the
unbiased estimates for NU and NU2  The latter estimate can then be subtracted
point-wise from the square of the former estimate to calculate the unbiased esti-
mate A9
