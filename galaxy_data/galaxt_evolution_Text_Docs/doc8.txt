Abstract This series of papers is intended to present astrocladistics in some detail and evaluate this methodology in recon-
structing phylogenies of galaxies Being based on the evolution of all the characters describing galaxies it is an objective way
of understanding galaxy diversity through evolutionary relationships In this rst paper we present the basic steps of a cladistic
analysis and show both theoretically and practically that it can be applied to galaxies For illustration we use a sample of
50 simulated galaxies taken from the GALICS database which are described by 91 observables dynamics masses and lumi-
nosities These 50 simulated galaxies are indeed 10 dierent galaxies taken at 5 cosmological epochs and they are free of
merger events The astrocladistic analysis easily reconstructs the true chronology of evolution relationships within this sample
It also demonstrates that burst characters are not relevant for galaxy evolution as a whole A companion paper is devoted to the
formalization of the concepts of formation and diversication in galaxy evolution
Key words Cladistics  Galaxies fundamental parameters  Galaxies evolution  Galaxies formation  Methods numerical

1 Introduction
Classication is a very human act to release memory and understand relationships between dierent kinds of objects Systematics
is the science of classication of living organisms It teaches us that there are three ways of comparing complex objects generated
during the course of evolution appearance global similarity and common history
The rst approach was used by the Greeks Aristotle and until the 18th century It was based on the selection of one or very
few obvious patterns of living organisms This selection was necessarily subjective and with the discovery of more and more
specimens during the Middle Ages numerous classications appeared They became rapidly awkward incompatible with one
another and unsatisfactory in the representation of the origin of the observed diversity see eg Knapp 2000
In comparison extragalactic astrophysics is a very young science beginning when Hubble discovered the true nature of
galaxies in 1922 Hubble 1922 He rapidly felt the need to classify these new objects using the only information he had ie
morphology Hubble 1926 and Fig 1 below In an attempt to understand the relations between the three classes ellipticals spirals
and barred spirals he subsequently introduced evolution and devised his famous tuning fork diagram Hubble 1936 Since then
the most successful galaxy classications consisted in variations on this scheme de Vaucouleurs 1959 Sandage 1961 Roberts
 Haynes 1994 Kormendy  Bender 1996 van den Bergh 1998 while getting rid of the original evolution signicance of this
diagram
Nowadays a new revolution is in progress extragalactic astronomy living a fascinating expansion with the advent of huge and
sensitive telescopes Amazing observed details reveal the complexity and diversity of galaxies and more precise data on distant
galaxies compel us to build the evolutionary history of galaxies as a whole The nature of the very rst objects still speculative
becomes more and more constrained between initial density uctuations observed through the cosmic background at 27 K
and the most distant galaxies known for which distance records are regularly beaten Steidel 1999 Pello Schaerer Richard
Le Borgne and Kneib 2004 Consequently many appellations supposedly more limited in scope than the Hubble classication
exist They are also based on appearance using specic observational criteria radio emission Lyman break spectral feature
activity in the nucleus starbursts dwarf or giant galaxies etc Traditional classication is thus challenged both because the
number of observed objects rules out the eye-based work still required to determine the morphology of a galaxy and more
fundamentally because this quasi mono-parameter approach is obviously inadequate to encompass the diversity and complexity
of galaxies through their evolutions
The second approach to classication is global similarity now known as multivariate analysis It was introduced by Adanson
1763 in an attempt to correct subjectivity in the choice of classifying characters Nature should decide which ones are important
not human beings Multivariate analysis known as phenetics in biology thus takes all describing characters available at the
epoch of study It has been an incredibly successful idea widely used in biology until the end of the 20th century and is still very
useful in many disciplines To our knowledge only a few attempts have been undertaken in astrophysics for a truly multivariate
not considering solely morphology galaxy classication see eg Whitmore 1984 Watanabe Kodaira and Okamura 1985
while it is widely used for astronomical data analysis eg Feigelson and Babu 2003 Corbin Urban Stobie Thompson and
Schneider 2001
The third approach is related to the hierarchical organization of biological diversity that was found quite early in the Middle
Ages Later Linne devised his still used nomenclature accordingly But this scheme of relationship between species was explained
only in the 19th century with the discovery of evolution through natural selection by Darwin 1859 Evolution creates diversity
and hierarchy is caused by the so-called branching evolution one species gives birth to descending species see Fraix-Burnet
Douzery Choler and Verhamme 2004 hereafter Paper II Since a living organism is described by its constituents and their
properties its evolution is nothing else than the evolution of all its characters and their interactions It is only in the mid-20th
century that this fact was used to build a new methodology to derive phylogenies called cladistics Hennig 1965 Essentially
all published trees of life now use this methodology see for instance Stewart 1993 Brower de Salle and Vogler 1996 In this
view two or more objects are related if they share a common history that is they possess properties inherited from a common
ancestor It is important not to be confused between evolution of individuals genealogy and evolution of species they represent
phylogeny Cladistics is only concerned with the latter
In astrophysics Hubble remains the only author to have used evolution in the design of his morphological classication
scheme Too often people try to model and understand evolution along the Hubble tuning fork diagram as if this articial ar-
rangement of the dierent morphologies is an observational fact Indeed astrophysicists roughly understand most of the physical
and chemical processes at work in galaxies including morphology and are able to model them reasonably well They now face
the problem of synthesising all such knowledge and all such observations
Because galaxies are dened as independent gravitational groups of stars gas and dust their evolution is dictated by the
evolution of their constituents Hence Fraix-Burnet Choler and Douzery 2003 introduced astrocladistics in an attempt to
apply cladistics to galaxies Van den Bergh 2003 private communication and Keel2002 also considered this possibility inde-
pendently Fraix-Burnet 2004 presents an overview of the progress of astrocladistics which have now tackled several samples
of galaxies
In the present two companion papers this one and paper II we present the fundamentals of astrocladistics This rst paper
concentrates on the applicability of cladistics to objects like galaxies emphasizing also the practical course of the analysis
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
The second paper is devoted to the formalization of the concepts of formation and evolution of galaxies by examining the
diversication processes
In these two papers we make use of simulated galaxies from the GALICS project in which galaxy formation and evolution
is simulated from a redshift of 30 to 0 0 being the present time Even though most of the physics leading from dark matter
uctuations to baryonic objects is still not well understood such numerical simulations begin to study the entire history of
galaxy formation as well as the origin of galaxy diversity In this rst paper a sample is used to show that chronology can be
reconstructed by a cladistic analysis while with another sample in the second paper it is shown that galaxy diversity can be
arranged on a tree-like structure
In Sect 2 of the present paper we show that theoretically galaxies are suitable objects for a phylogenetic analysis This is
illustrated in Sect 3 with the detailed presentation of a cladistic analysis making it obvious that all the ingredients are available
for an application to galaxies In Sect 4 after a brief introduction to the GALICS database we describe how we dened and
selected our sample Results are described in Sect 5 while a discussion can be found in Sect 6 Summary and conclusion are
given in Sect 7
2 Astrocladistics general principles
21 Systematicsandcladistics
The two fundamentals of cladistics are in no way related to the kind of objects being studied i diversity generated by evolu-
tionary processes ii hierarchical tree-like organization of this diversity due to the branching type of evolution Wiley Siegel-
Causey Brooks and Funk 1991 Brower 2000 Paper II On the practical side cladistics requires objects that can be described
by characters for which transformation can be documented For instance alongside biology it is used in linguistics Wells 1987
stemmatics study of ancient books Robinson  Robert 1996 and even in manufacturing organization eg Tsinopoulos 
McCarthy 2000
Innovations appearing in an ancestral species propagate themselves through all its descendants Cladistics relates objects by
identifying these innovations called synapomorphies ie shared derived evolved character states Reality is more complicated
since the same innovations can appear independently at dierent times in dierent species and converge through dierent evolu-
tionary paths convergences or even disappear at a later time reversals These processes called homoplasies bring noise but
can be identied in the cladistic analysis
Cladistics is a methodology a tool to synthetically visualize informative evolution data as well as hypotheses It does not
reveal the true evolutionary tree but merely a possible one given the available data current knowledge identied hypotheses
and chosen criteria Wiley et al 1991 see Sect 3 It has a very powerful interpretive and predictive power regarding the
evolutions of all characters because the nal evolutionary scenario must be entirely consistent with all the input information The
assumption of branching evolution is thus evaluated in the same process
Cladistics is not concerned with objects as individuals but rather with species It is not an analysis of the genealogy who
is parent of whom but of the phylogeny who is the cousin of whom It is not aimed at identifying the ancestor of a group
of objects because this ancestor is generally not available to the present day observer of living organisms or galaxies Rather
cladistics groups together objects that share a common ancestor see eg Wiley et al 1991
22 Ontheevolutionofgalaxies
Galaxies are independent groups of stars gas and dust These constituents with all their properties or characters both dene
and describe a galaxy They evolve by themselves through interactions with one another and under external perturbations They
are the evolution of galaxies and galaxy species Vilchez Stasinska and Perez 2001 Sauvage Stasinska and Schaerer 2002
Hensler Stasinska Harfst Kroupa and Theis 2003
The formation of a galaxy is the gathering of these elements in one gravitational entity each one with its own history The
merging of two galaxies is the mixing together of their constituents whose properties can be seriously modied by the associated
perturbations An interaction of a galaxy with its environment gas gravitational potential due to other galaxies or dark matter
often strongly aects its internal constituents starbursts accretion or sweeping of gas collapse onto central black hole  the
galaxy might afterwards look signicantly dierent as it would if it belonged to a new type or class or species All these formation
and diversication processes imply the transmission of the properties of the previous galaxy to the new one with modication of
some of the properties depending on the evolutionary driver This characterizes a branching evolution as discussed in more detail
in Paper II
Hence galaxies are good candidates for a cladistic analysis both because their evolution creates diversity and because the evo-
lution of their fundamental constituents can be observed interpreted and predicted through observations and physicalchemical
models Such an analysis can tell us the evolutionary relationships among dierent classes of galaxies through a synthesis of the
evolutions of all the physical and chemical processes as contained in the input characters These are observable descriptors of the
fundamental constituents In astrophysics the characters are to be found in spectra absolute luminosities colours or ux ratios
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
Fig 1 Illustration of how the Hubble tuning fork diagram can be obtained from a cladistic analysis m and b are the two characters
morphology and bar respectively 0 stands for absence of spiral arm or bar 1 meaning presence The slashes on
branches indicate a change in one character state For instance to go from type E to type S one needs to modify the state of
character m from 0 to 1 This tree is said to have two steps two character state changes altogether
kinematic information spectral line properties Morphology is not adequate because it is subjective essentially determined by
eye and qualitative More importantly it is included in kinematical characteristics because the apparent morphology of a galaxy
essentially reects the 3-dimensional motions of the stellar population but is always observed as a 2D projection only
What we call classes or species will be dened after the analysis of a large sample of galaxies is done that is after the
evolutionary relationships are better understood In cladistics two taxa are grouped together if they share some common derived
character states see Sect 34 which are supposed to have been inherited from a common ancestor Astrocladistics will thus lead
us toward a new taxonomy that is toward a new classication and nomenclature Before that can be made and particularly in
this paper each individual galaxy is considered as a representative of a class see Sect 32 We also use the word class in a
generic manner and avoid the word type because it is inevitably linked to the Hubble morphological classication
3 Phylogenetic analysis of galaxies using cladistics
This section is intended to outline the basic steps of a cladistic analysis with emphasis on its general application to galaxies
and giving specic parameters used in the analysis of the sample introduced in Sect 4 It is not a thorough presentation of this
methodology which can be found in many places eg Wiley et al 1991
31 Outline
The principal qualities of a cladistic analysis are objectivity and transparency Practically the objects under study are described
by evolutionary characters Sect 33 for which at least two states are dened Sect 34 one is said to be ancestral the other
one is said to be derived Most often this evolution orientation is known for a very few characters only increasing the number of
possible phylogenies The derived state corresponds to an innovation in the evolution and is assumed to have been acquired by an
unidentied ancestor In cladistics objects are grouped from the derived character states they share encompassing the ancestor
and all its descendants after transformation from the ancestral state The basic ingredient to the analysis is thus a matrix scoring
for all taxa the states for all characters Sect 34
Because cladistics assumes branching evolution the evolutionary relationships are represented on a tree or cladogram The
process for nding the trees is very basic and can be done by hand This is illustrated on Fig 1 which schematically demonstrates
how the Hubble diagram can be obtained from a cladistic analysis Let us consider three galaxy classes and two characters with
two states morphology spiral or elliptical and bar present or absent Assuming these states represent evolution and considering
the changes of character states necessary to evolve from one type to the other we can build an unrooted cladogram which happens
to be exactly the Hubble tuning fork diagram To root the cladogram one should decide at least for one character which state is
ancestral Sect 36 For instance Hubble thought that ellipticals become spirals with time Hence he would have dened 0 as
ancestral state for character m Nowadays the reverse is preferred which would make 0 the derived state
The goal of astrocladistics can be viewed as to extend this exercise to all possible descriptors for better objectivity and many
more classes of galaxies for better coverage of galaxy diversity This is presented in Sect 37
Finally there are some statistical methods to assess the robustness of the result trees Sect 38 which must be used before
trying a thorough interpretation Sect 39
32 Choiceofasample
The aim of astrocladistics is to group objects from homologies But there are millions of galaxies in the Universe the nature
and composition of the very rst objects are unknown groups of stars gas overdensities  so that there might well be several
dierent kinds of initial seeds of galaxies Thus picking up galaxies that might have relatively close evolutionary relationships is
somewhat like a shing experience at such an exploratory stage
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
There are at least two possible approaches i use probability estimates of close relationships within the original sample and
then group objects accordingly before performing the cladistic analysis eg Wiens 2001 and references therein ii assume one
object - one class and let the cladistic analysis identify groups from evolutionary considerations For these rst developments of
astrocladistics we have favoured the second approach to avoid possible biases of pre-classication introduced by the rst one
Later on it would be certainly interesting to compare the two We also try to begin with galaxies that belong spatially to the same
group or cluster because they more probably have derived from the same kind of initial seeds and evolved in the same global
environment This is however not the case in the two present companion papers that use simulated galaxies
Even if millions of galaxies are currently known a tiny fraction of them are described with more than a dozen observables
Currently between about 50 to 100 characters can be obtained for a few hundred galaxies which are all quite close to us hence
very evolved Thanks to space and big aperture ground-based telescopes this is changing rapidly A future development will be to
extract from the medium or high resolution spectra the adequate information to be used by methodologies such as astrocladistics
Nevertheless since galaxies might not be as complex objects as living organisms it is thus highly probable that the numbers
of pertinent characters will not be signicantly more than one or two hundred This is still much higher than in Hubbles time
and large enough to dene many classes As technology improves as knowledge increases new characters become available
requiring analyses of the same groups of objects to be redone periodically Hence classications must evolve and are never
denitive
33 Buildingthematrix
In order to remain as objective as possible it is preferable not to choose characters a priori but rather to take all the ones available
at the time of study and let the analysis reveal possible inconsistencies in character behaviours Ideally characters should be
independent regarding evolution One rst obvious reason is to avoid redundancy of information and overweight of a single
evolutionary process A second less obvious reason is to ensure a better statistical signicance of the resulting evolutionary
scheme by minimizing possible conicts between character evolutions Also the use of the parsimony criterion as will be
described in Sect 37 emphasizes characters that do not change too much nor too erratically However the requirement of
character independence is not so easy to satisfy a priori and should be re-analysed afterwards Note that two characters can be
independent and apparently correlated for instance metallicity and mass of galaxies can both increase with evolution but are not
necessarily physically related Dierential weights can be given to characters but this will not be considered in this series of
Two unique particularities of astrophysical observations are not usual to cladists uncertainties and upperlower limits
Because they are quite informative and common they should be included Physical data are meaningless if they are not ac-
companied by an estimation of the accuracy of the measurement These can be treated in the analysis either by a weight matrix
or in the coding process see following section Upper and lower limits generally result from limited sensitivity of the detectors
andor conditions of observations bad seeing background sky brightness source confusion etc Hence in a given sample and
for a given character they do not always correspond to extreme ends of ranges of values They also do not reveal the distribution
of values below above the lower upper limit Thus when possible they can be in one bin at either end of the codings
34 Codingthematrix
Astrophysical observables are in general continuous values There are strong debates on whether or not such data should be
used in biology eg Rae 1998 but astronomers have no choice Yet we think their use is totally legitimate in the case of
galaxies because the change of characters is mainly gradual and totally reects evolution That being said there remain several
possibilities to code such values Thorough investigations will have to be performed in the future
For a cladistic analysis at least two evolutionary states should be identied for each character an ancestral state and a derived
state Depending on the character depending on the sample characters can be coded into several states Continuous data should
be binned and unknown values are allowed
Upper or lower limits are not explicitly treated as such in current cladistic software Nevertheless they can be considered as
real values if they correspond to upper or lower bins and possibly be attributed a lower weight Uncertainties can be treated in two
ways First bins can be chosen to be signicantly larger than the error bars of the data Second it is always possible to do several
analyses with slightly dierent codings and compare results No upperlower limits nor error bars are present in our GALICS
sample so we do not discuss this point any further
For the simulated sample of this paper we attributed eight evolutionary states to each character by regularly binning the
corresponding range of values among all galaxies For photometric characters three kinds of such coding have been performed 
using ux values magnitudes and colours with respect to the Johnson K band and comparing the results Sect 51
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
35 Introducingadditionalconstraints
The more information is given initially the more constrained and robust the result will be For a given group of taxa the more
characters the better But any knowledge on the evolutions of these characters is also extremely useful to help eliminate some
evidently impossible evolutionary scenarios This also constitutes a means to test dierent hypotheses or models
In this paper we impose that all characters evolve smoothly with time that is they are all supposed to be ordered changes
between two adjacent states are more parsimonious see Sect 37 than between distant ones In other words big jumps are
supposedly less probable than gentle character evolution This hypothesis is physically sensible in the case of galaxies and we
found that it signicantly improves the robustness of trees
36 Deningtheoutgroup
Dening evolutionary states only yields an unrooted tree because the arrow of time is not indicated Time behaviour of at least
some characters is required to root the cladogram This can be introduced in the additional constraints andor by dening a
comparison group outgroup which is a real or hypothesized taxon having some identied ancestral states This outgroup
should be outside the studied sample and share a common ancestor with it even if in practice it is often regarded as part of the
sample Hence it should be neither too far nor too close in the evolutionary diversication The choice of the outgroup is always
delicate and rarely unique The detailed interpretation of the resulting phylogeny for the group of study depends on this choice
but the classes of possible phylogenies are revealed even on an unrooted tree
In astrophysics determining potential outgroups for the sample under study is at present nearly impossible In general it
could be possible to build an articial outgroup because some characters have a known global evolution through the lifetime of
the Universe For instance the metallicities and the masses of galaxies are expected to increase because stars gradually transform
light atomic elements hydrogen helium into heavier ones oxygen carbon and gravity makes galaxies bigger with time via
accretions and mergers But locally an accretion of a big cloud of hydrogen gas can diminish the average metallicity of a galaxy
and through interactions galaxies can be torn apart into smaller pieces
In this paper we decided not to root the trees because this part of our work is intended to demonstrate that physical descriptors
of galaxies do trace their evolution and show how astrocladistics reconstruct the chronology For display purposes only we
assume that epoch 1 galaxies are closer to the ancestor common to the entire group This is equivalent to dening an outgroup
but here it is an arbitrary choice which we consider sucient for the present work
37 Findingthebesttrees
For a given matrix a set of taxa and coded characters the number of possible trees is huge and grows as 2n  32n2n  2
where n is the number of objects Swoord Olsen Waddell and Hillis 1996 For more than 4 objects with 4 characters the
process of nding trees is not tractable by hand any more see Sect 31 and computers are required There are several software
packages available We used the PAUP4b10 package Swoord 2003 on Linux PC computers to perform all calculations shown
in this paper
To choose among the huge amount of possible trees a usual criterion is maximum parsimony the total number of character
state changes so-called steps on the tree is minimized This also minimizes the number of homoplasies convergences or
reversals in character evolution which perturbs the grouping in evolutionary classes If several most parsimonious trees are
found then a consensus tree can be built
In this paper because the sample was arbitrarily chosen galaxies have a chance to be too distant in the evolutionary diver-
sication It is also possible that there exist dierent evolutionary pathways with several very dierent ancestors This prevents
a good relationship to be found and leads to a largely unresolved tree Our strategy was to nd a sub-sample that yields a fully
resolved tree For this purpose we eliminated taxa one by one running the analyses and comparing the number of bootstrap
values above 50 Sect 38 for details on bootstrap method on all the resulting trees the best resolved tree was kept and the
corresponding taxon denitively eliminated before the same process started again with the new sub-sample We thus ended up
with a robust tree concerning objects that can be said to be evolutionarily related
In these two companion papers we further attempted an analysis with all the eliminated galaxies since the number of char-
acters should be higher than the number of taxa to obtain a good resolution of the phylogeny If a robust tree is found this would
mean that it might either be a kind of redundant object with respect to the rst tree or constitute another monophyletic group
with a dierent ancestor Another strategy not considered in these two companion papers would be to place the eliminated taxa
onto the rst tree This could imply dening groups and would allow us to extend the cladistic analysis to other objects to build
progressively a phylogenetic classication of larger samples of galaxies
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
38 Assessingthephylogeneticsignalinthedata
After the most parsimonious trees are found some statistical tests are performed in order to assess the robustness of the results
Ideally the phylogenetic signal evolutionary information should not depend on too few dominant characters because of possible
errors or uncertainties in the data misbehaviours of these characters or too high a dependence on current level of knowledge and
observational techniques The bootstrap method Felsenstein 1985 Efron  Tibshirani 1986 analyses the robustness of the tree
to noise in the sample through the percentage of times a node is found among results from resampled matrices 1000 in this
paper These matrices are identical in size to the original one but each character column is randomly selected from the entire
initial set Hence a resampled matrix can have several times the same character and lack some of them Bootstrap is therefore
a way to put random weights on individual characters and then evaluate the ability of the tree-building method to recover the
initial nodes despite these dierential character weightings The Decay or Bremer index indicates how many more steps on the
tree are needed to destroy the corresponding branch Bremer 1994 It measures the robustness of the supposedly-best tree which
has been selected using the parsimony criterion
Two other indicators are generally given with each tree and can be computed for each character or globally The Consistency
Index CI measures the diculty of tting a data set on a particular tree it is the ratio between the minimum number of possible
steps given by the data matrix and the total number of steps of the tree It is always lower than 1 and a perfect phylogeny ie
without homoplasy in the characters analysis would give a CI of 1 This indicator can thus be used to examine the behaviour of a
given character on a particular tree The Retention Index RI measures the level of similarities in the tree In a sense it measures
for the same matrix the distance of the result tree to the worst case totally unresolved tree due to total lack of phylogenetic
signal and to the best one perfect phylogeny with the result tree RI behaves like CI being larger in good situations Wiley et
al 1991
39 Interpretingthecladograms
Two branches on the tree are linked by a node which represents the collection of shared derived characters due to common
ancestry A long branch with several nodes is called a lineage All descendants characterized by unique derived characters
inherited from their common ancestor constitute a monophyletic phylogenetic group or clade This is the basis of a phylogenetic
inference based on a cladogram
Interpretation of the result is done by projecting the coded characters onto the branches of the cladogram Self-consistencies
and estimation of global consistency with input data hypotheses and other current thoughts on galaxy evolution and their physics
helps one to conclude on the validity of the evolutionary scenario proposed by the cladistic analysis Groupings nd historical
explanations in the projected character evolutions along branches and anomalies can be identied Finally predictions may come
out for objects on the tree that have missing data
4 A test sample simulated galaxies without mergers
In this rst paper to simplify as much as possible the cladistic analysis and the interpretation of the results a sample of galaxies
that have never had any merger events was selected Our goal here is to demonstrate that from observables describing galaxies
that is characterizing their basic constituents it is possible to reconstruct the historical relationships among a sample of galaxies
Paper II describes in detail the processes of formation and diversication of galaxies and enlightens our choice some more
41 BriefpresentationofGALICS
GALICS Galaxies In Cosmological Simulations is a hybrid model for hierarchical galaxy formation studies combining the
outputs of large cosmological N-body simulations with simple semi-analytic recipes to describe the fate of the baryons within
dark matter haloes Hatton Devriendt Ninin Bouchet and Guiderdoni 2003 A galaxy appears when the density of baryonic
matter is above a given level corresponding to the resolution of the simulation As hot gas cools and falls to the centre of
these haloes it settles in a rotationally supported disc Galaxies remain disc structures unless mergers or instabilities occur in
which case simple recipes are used to develop a bulge and a burst components Hence a galaxy is described by these three
components each one having its own parameters of geometry dynamics masses stars and gas metallicity and photometry from
the ultraviolet to the far infrared Stellar and chemical evolution is modelled but no interaction between galaxies are considered
Each galaxy is identied by a specic number at each timestep of the simulation Each galaxy is the product of one or more
galaxies of the previous step and one or more evolutionary processes that occurred since the previous step The entire genealogy
of each galaxy is thus known It is then possible to select galaxies that have never been the product of the merging of two or more
galaxies
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
42 Problematicsofselectingasample
It must be mentioned that choosing galaxies for a phylogenetic analysis is not a trivial problem at this preliminary stage Taking
objects too close in the evolution process hampers the diversity resolution Conversely if galaxies are too dierent ie too much
diversied it is dicult to nd the evolutionary relationship In both cases it is dicult to nd a robust tree The problem lies
in the denition of similarity which is here taken in the evolutionary sense and can be really understood only after a cladistics
analysis is made Comparing objects in the traditional way with a few apparent characters or with a multivariate distance
analysis is not adequate because of probable homoplasies see Sect 21 One might hope to nd galaxies identically described
based on coded characters Unfortunately a few tens of characters having a few states already makes a substantial number of
possibilities so we have not yet encountered such cases
The problem would be certainly much simpler with simulated galaxies However we wanted to train ourselves by considering
the simulation as if it was the real Universe with no genealogical information available to the observers This information was
used only to select non-merger galaxies in the database and compare with our results afterwards
As described in Sect 37 a huge number of possible trees exist for a given set of objects and characters The analysis is
thus very CPU time consuming and cannot be reasonably done with too many objects We consider that about 50 is a good
compromise with our present knowledge of cladistic galaxy classication and with the number of currently available descriptors
characters As already mentioned in Sect 32 and as discussed in Paper II at this stage of astrocladistics each galaxy represents
a class to be dened later on
43 Thesampleofgalaxieswithoutmerger
We chose 10 galaxies at 5 epochs simulation step 30 40 50 60 and 70 corresponding to redshift of 3 19 1 04 and 0 These
galaxies were arbitrarily chosen among all galaxies born at redshift 3 simulation step of 30 and having experienced no merging
during the time spanned by the 5 epochs They are representative of classes and named from An to Jn where n is the epoch 1 to
5 1 being the most ancient one and 5 the present redshift  0
In the GALICS database 91 characters are available to describe these galaxies and listed in Table 1 Two characters are global
bolometric luminosity and infrared luminosity the other ones describing the three components of GALICS galaxies the disc
31 characters the bulge 27 and the burst 31 Most 3  23 are broad band magnitudes ranging from U to 500 micron
As explained in Sect 51 all magnitudes are relative to the K band this last value giving the relative heights of the spectra or
relative brightnesses between galaxies The dynamical time tdyn is the time taken for material at the half-mass radius to reach
the opposite side of the galaxy disk component or its centre bulge and burst components whereas the star formation rate is
derived from this dynamical time the mass of the cold gas and a prescribed star formation eciency either instantaneous at the
last time substep of the simulation or averaged over the last step Hatton et al 2003
5 Results
51 Fluxmagnitudesorcolours
Even if all characters should be used in a cladistics analysis it is important to avoid obvious biases In astrophysics an invaluable
source of information lies in the spectra or here in the broad band magnitudes But since a bright galaxy is very probably bright
at nearly all wavelengths using these characters crudely would give too much weight to the galaxy luminosity Rather colours or
relative luminosities are much more informative about the dierent components in a galaxy and for evolution We found that they
provide better robustness to the nal tree which tends to validate this statement We will only consider the colour based result in
the rest of this paper
Magnitudes are merely transcription logarithmic of uxes The choice among the two implies somewhat dierent distribu-
tions of objects into character codes and allows for dierent resolution of diversity We believe that there is no general rule on this
point and both should be tried On the present sample the results were not very dierent in terms of relationships and because
trees are found to be slightly more robust we preferred coding logarithmic values magnitudes
52 Reconstructingthecorrectchronology
Is a character evolution based analysis such as cladistics able to gure out the correct chronology of galactic evolution It is
possible to give the answer thanks to the simulated galaxies of GALICS chosen in this work We considered each of the 10
galaxies A to J at the 5 epochs building 10 matrices with 5 objects Analyses were then performed independently for each
matrix In these conditions the cladistic analysis nds excellent phylogenies as illustrated in Fig 2 for galaxies A C and I All
trees do have the correct chronology and all have bootstrap values of 100 except for galaxies C and I which have slightly lower
indexes
The cladograms show that galaxies at epoch 5 are the most diversied when compared to galaxies at epoch 1 Branch length
represents number of character state changes and are not directly related to a time scale It should be noted that the results are

obtained with all characters As will be seen in Sect 53 burst characters introduce noise and are certainly not very relevant for
galaxy evolution Still the results on the 10 sub-samples are excellent and could only be better yet without burst components
Here the capability of astrocladistics to nd the right history is thus demonstrated on a concrete basis

53 Historyofthewholesamplekeepingallcharacters
In the real world we do not have the information on common ancestry Hence we have to hypothesize it and proceed with the
entire analysis in order to test this assumption by trying to nd the best tree As described in Sect 37 our procedure was to
exclude objects one by one until we nd optimal bootstrap values on the result tree Finally 11 galaxies were so removed and
we obtained the cladogram shown in Fig 3 with the 39 remaining galaxies Bootstrap values and decay indexes are excellent
Going downward along the cladogram it is possible to see that galaxies order themselves correctly in chronology from A1
taken as the root to J5 after which the trend goes the other way to end up with C1 and H1 as the most diversied with respect to
A1 Changing the root to C5 or B4-B5 would make a tree diverging into two lineages Both would be chronologically reversed
from epoch 5 to epoch 1 Another option is that there could be two ancestors A1 and C1 for instance making the two lineages
to merge around C5-B4 The picture would not be a tree anymore and in this case separate analyses of the two lineages should
be done see Sect 54
To understand Fig 3 and make a reasonable choice for the root it is useful to look at character evolution and momentarily
assume that the number of character state changes represented by branch lengths is grossly proportional to time As can be seen
in Table 2 last 23 columns on the right it is noticeable that galaxies B C G H and J have no burst component code 7 in
the table at epoch 1 and all are at the bottom of the tree Note also that G H and J have no burst component at all epochs The
cladogram seems to indicate that the burst luminosity should rather smoothly decrease with time Indeed bursts are by denition
temporary events provoked by instabilities in the disk or accretion of gas They can thus appear and disappear at nearly any time
as is the case for galaxy B2 and C2
54 Twogroupsandtwodifferentancestors
At this stage of the analysis two options are possible The rst one is to assume that because galaxies ADEFI and BCGHJ
are born with dierent burst components they could have two dierent ancestors The same analyses have been performed on
each one of these subgroups The resulting cladograms are shown on Fig 4 They are both well resolved especially because
no galaxy removal for optimization was necessary except only for B2 There are one or two little supported nodes on each tree
Fraix-Burnet et al Astrocladistics a phylogenetic analysis of galaxy evolution I
Fig 4 Most parsimonious trees obtained considering the whole sample contains two groups ADEFI and BCGHJ with two
dierent ancestors Only B2 has been removed to obtain the cladogram on the right Numbers to the left of each node are
bootstrap above and decay below with a plus sign values Scale bar on the left of each cladogram indicates 10 steps Tree for
ADEFI steps701 CI050 RI080 Tree for BCGHJ steps791 CI069 RI081 see Sect 38
bootstrap less than 60 but the other nodes show that the two ancestor hypothesis is a very plausible interpretation By the way
the chronology is perfectly respected in both diagrams
The second option is to remove burst characters and is detailed in the next section
55 Removingburstcharacters
Since burst characters are doubtful indicators of galaxy evolution we have done the analysis of the entire sample 50 galaxies
without them characters 15-22 and 69-91 of Table 1 were ignored Among the 60 remaining characters the bulge photometry
ones 46-68 are identical in all galaxies but three B3 B4 B5 see Table 2 This makes the total number of signicantly
discriminant characters somewhat too low to hope to obtain a very robust cladogram for the 50 galaxies
By the same optimization procedure described in Sect 37 and used in Sect 53 20 galaxies were removed leaving an
excellent cladogram with 30 objects Fig 5 The 20 excluded galaxies were analysed as well and the cladogram in Fig 6 has
been obtained without any optimization The result is excellent bootstraps are high and the true chronology well respected There
is only one weakly supported node bootstrap of 52 indicating an unresolved relationship or a few objects too diversied to t
in this group
We have thus identied two groups of galaxies whose cladograms are globally better supported than those obtained from
the two ancestor hypotheses of the previous section Here also we have two groups but they have not been chosen a priori As
said above the rather low ratio of number of characters versus number of taxa prevents us from drawing conclusions on common
ancestry of these two groups To denitively answer the question one would need more discriminant characters or begin dening
classes by analysing behaviour of all characters on the cladograms of Fig 5 and Fig 6 This is beyond the scope of this paper

6 Discussion
Among the dierent results presented in this paper those shown in Fig 5 and Fig 6 Sect 55 are clearly the most satisfactory
because they are less aected by a priori subjective choice and the evolutionary scenario represented on the cladograms is
astrophysically plausible On the contrary the analysis using all characters Sect 53 is plagued by doubt on burst characters
as galaxy evolution indicators The other results Sect 52 and Sect 54 heavily depend on our a priori knowledge of lineages
available thanks to the simulations They thus seem very articial and cannot be representative of a real data set
This illustrates the principal strength of astrocladistics in classifying galaxy diversity The resulting cladogram is objectively
obtained and can be accurately discussed on this basis Particular points of debate can be
1 character coding several choices are possible dierent results can be compared Character values are all quantitative inu-
ence of measure uncertainties can be examined
2 evolution of characters some knowledge or hypotheses can be put here principally intended to increase tree robustness
3 character weighting extreme care should be taken when imposing weights on characters probably useful when only up-
perlower limits are known or when uncertainties are large
4 choice of outgroup quite a dicult task because it is generally dicult to nd the right one especially at this stage of
astrocladistics
The main result of the present paper is that the true chronology is easily found This proves that simulated observables used
here to describe galaxies are certainly representative of their evolution that is of the evolution of their fundamental constituents
This is a clear demonstration that astrocladistics is well-founded It is essential to note that these observables are available in real
galaxy catalogues
Once again galaxies here represent classes or species and this should be kept in mind when reading the cladograms They
are not considered as individuals we are not visualizing the development of an object through time but rather the dierent classes
a galaxy belongs to during the course of the ve epochs This could be seen as if an individual galaxy can change class during
evolution as is already noticed by van den Bergh 1998 for morphology and Hatton et al 2003 in GALICS simulated galaxies
However as discussed in more detail in Paper II we nd this notion confusing regarding diversication In astrocladistics it is
preferable to focus on galaxy species if a galaxy shows a new characteristic typical of a new class then it should be considered
as a new galaxy that somehow have kept some characteristics of its parenthood Hence these two classes should be close on the
In Fig 5 objects of a given epoch are not always grouped together Also two galaxies seem to evolve at dierent rates
depending also on epoch This is because evolution does not take place only in time but also in space Even if two galaxies

are born at the same epoch they are not formed from the same material stars gas and dust this material not having the same
history In addition these two galaxies do not live in the same environment and the internal instabilities have no chance to occur
at the same time and be of the same intensity Sometimes two epochs of the same galaxies are reversed on the tree for instance
B1B2 E4E5 I1I4 The explanation should be searched for through an analysis of character evolutions along the cladogram
but this is out of the scope of this paper In itself this fact is not a problem in view of what has been just said in the previous
paragraph It should be noted that diversity is probably quite low in this sample of galaxies without merger and interaction events
7 Conclusions
Because galaxies are complex objects in evolution described and characterized by basic constituents stars gas and dust the
prerequisites for a phylogenetic analysis using cladistics are satised Using a sample of galaxies resulting from simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution we demonstrate the correctness of our approach Even on a very little diversied galaxy group
like galaxies with no merger and no interaction cladistics is able to reconstruct the right history from observables We illustrate
the power of such a phylogenetic analysis in providing insights on galaxy physics For instance we pinpoint burst characters as
being not very pertinent to describe galaxy evolution because they are too variable
We are certainly quite far from being able to depict the observed galaxy diversity on a general cladogram The sample used
in this paper is made of galaxies that are too simple as compared to the real world Other diculties will certainly arise notably
when dealing with interacting objects The question of the nature and composition of the very rst objects can be crucial to the
usefulness of astrocladistics because it could multiply the number of dierent types of ancestors But conversely astrocladistics
is an excellent tool to investigate this problem and only a long-range analysis would help It is important to understand that many
developments are possible to improve the analysis shown in this paper statistical tools can be used to pre-select some groups
many trials could be made concerning character choice evolution redundancy and variability coding of continuous characters
should be studied in detail use of medium and high resolution spectra should be investigated But only real galaxies deserve as
a matter of priority such comprehensive studies
Cladograms can somehow be seen as a large generalization of the Hubble diagram Sect 31 But they have much broader
implications and applications Astrocladistics is a new philosophy for galaxy classication Beyond paving the way to a new
taxonomy it increases enormously our chances to one day understand galaxy evolution by identifying progenitor classes to
todays galaxies back to the very rst objects of the Universe
