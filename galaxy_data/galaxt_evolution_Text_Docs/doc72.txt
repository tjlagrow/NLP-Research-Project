1 Introduction
One important approach to the study of galaxy evolution is to identify those
galaxies whose spectral andor morphological characteristics suggest that
they are in transition For example EA galaxies  which have strong
Balmer absorption lines and no signicant OII emission are generally
interpreted as post-starburst galaxies in which the star formation ceased
within the last  Gyr Figure 1 This transition between a star forming
and non-star forming state is a critical link in any galaxy evolution model
in which a blue star forming disk galaxy evolves into a S0 or elliptical
Another possible evolutionary track is that the star formation in an EA
resumes at some later time if enough gas remains in the galaxy after its
starburst ends Given this ambiguity it is important to investigate 1 the
environments role in EA evolution 2 the stellar and gas morphologies
of EAs 3 the likely progenitors of EAs and 4 how common the
EA phase is in the evolution of galaxies
This proceeding summarizes recent results from several inter-related
projects designed to address these questions These projects focus on a sam-
ple of 21 nearby EA galaxies 005  z  015 Zabludo et al 1996

These studies include VLA and HST observations in addition to compar-
isons of these data with galaxy-galaxy interaction simulations and stellar
population synthesis models My collaborators are D Zaritsky UCOLick
The term EA is a bit of a misnomer The Mg Fe and Ca lines observed in the
spectra of these galaxies are consistent with the stellar populations of ellipticals or Es
The additional A designation arose from the galaxies strong Balmer absorption lines
which are characteristic of A stars Because the morphologies of EAs now appear to
range from spheroidals to disks a more apt and exclusively spectroscopic designation is
KA cf Franx 1993 Nevertheless we use EA throughout this paper for historical
reasons

2 Environment and EA Evolution
The role of environment in the evolution of EA galaxies specically
in producing the initial burst of star formation in ending it and in al-
lowing it to resume is unknown In past work the detection of EAs
almost exclusively in distant clusters led to speculation that these galaxies
represent an evolutionary sequence unique to or most ecient in cluster
environments The existence of such a cluster-dependent evolutionary se-
quence would suggest that the cluster environment in the form of the intra-
cluster medium galaxy harassment or the global potential is responsible
for the recent star formation history of EAs and by extension for the
Butcher-Oemler eect Butcher  Oemler 1978 in clusters In contrast to
this line of reasoning Schweizer 1982 1996 and others nd several nearby
EAs that appear to lie outside the hot dense environments of clusters
and that have highly disturbed morphologies consistent with the products
of galaxy-galaxy mergers To isolate at least one mechanism that governs

the region hHi  55 A and EWO II  25 A from which the sample of 21 EA
galaxies large points is drawn The inset shows that EWO II cut excludes galaxies
with a more than 2 detection
the evolution of EA galaxies requires a statistical inventory of the en-
vironments in which EAs form The Las Campanas Redshift Survey
LCRS which includes high signal-to-noise spectra for  11000 galaxies
with 005  z  015 is the ideal sample with which to characterize the
environments of EAs
To identify EA galaxies in the LCRS having properties consistent
with those of known EAs we plot the distribution of Balmer absorp-
tion line and OII emission line strength for the LCRS galaxies Figure
2 Zabludo et al 1996 The EAs are selected to have the strongest
Balmer absorption lines the average of the equivalent widths of H  
is  55 A and weakest O II emission-line equivalent widths  25 A
which corresponds to a detection of O II of less than 2 signicance of
any of the galaxies in the survey We test whether these 21 EAs lie in
rich clusters in several ways including calculating the local galaxy density
around each EA and also checking whether the EA is a member
of a rich cluster in the LCRS group catalog Tucker 1994 Surprisingly
a large fraction  75 of nearby EAs lie in the eld well outside
of clusters and rich groups of galaxies We conclude that interactions with
the cluster environment are not essential for EA formation and there-

fore that the presence of these galaxies in distant clusters does not provide
strong evidence for the eects of cluster environment on galaxy evolution
If one mechanism is responsible for EA formation then the obser-
vations that EAs exist in the eld and that at least ve of the 21 in our
sample have clear tidal features argue that galaxy-galaxy interactions and
mergers are that mechanism The most likely environments for such merg-
ers are poor groups of galaxies which have lower velocity dispersions than
clusters and higher galaxy densities than the eld Groups are correlated
with rich clusters and in hierarchical models fall into clusters in greater
numbers at intermediate redshifts than they do today cf Bower 1991
Lacey  Cole 1993 Kaumann 1994 When combined with the strong
evolution observed in the eld population cf Broadhurst et al 1988 Lilly
et al 1995 our work suggests that the Butcher-Oemler eect may reect
the typical evolution of galaxies in groups and in the eld rather than the
inuence of clusters on the star formation history of galaxies
3 Stellar and HI Morphologies of EAs
Is the transition between galaxy types implied by the post-star formation
spectrum of an EA seen in its morphology The two HST images that
we have obtained to date suggest a morphological transition One EA
has an E type morphology but has extended tidal tails The other EA
is a barred S0 If star formation does not resume in these galaxies they will
look like early types after their blue stars die One interesting unanswered
question is why galaxies of such dierent morphologies have such similar
spectra
There is substantial evidence that galaxy-galaxy interactions increase
star formation rates While the eects of such interactions are consistent
with the starburst history of EAs the mechanism by which the star
formation stops is still a mystery The HI morphologies of EAs can
provide some clues
In the rst LCRS EA for which we have obtained VLA data Figure
3 there are clear HI tidal tails similar to those of the Antennae Hibbard
 Mihos 1995 These tails support the galaxy-galaxy interaction picture
for EA formation Perhaps even more interesting is the distribution of
the gas not in the tails The gas mass is comparable to that in disk galaxies
 5  109 M but it is extended over 50h1 kpc Thus the lack of star
formation in this EA is not due to an absence of gas but perhaps to
the low density of that gas It is possible that this gas will someday fall
back into the galaxy and generate new star formation
The rareed HI gas in this EA suggests that the subsequent evo-
lution of such galaxies could be aected by environment Extended gas is

bJ image of one of the bluest EAs in the sample The central HI gas has a mass of
 5  109M consistent with that in late type galaxies but it is extended over more
than 50h1 kpc
easier to strip by ram pressure than that in galactic disks Therefore if this
EA formed in a subcluster instead of the eld it is likely that the ef-
fects of the intracluster medium would preclude subsequent star formation
While derived from only one VLA observation to date this speculation may
illuminate one source of the dierence between the galaxy morphologies in
clusters and in the eld In this spirit our current observational program
is to compare the gas distributions in cluster and eld EAs
4 EA Progenitors
As discussed above the clear tidal features in some EAs indicate that
these galaxies have evolved morphologically in addition to spectroscopi-
cally To identify the morphologies of the most likely EA progenitors
we assume that two progenitors merge to form an EA and derive limits
on their gas-to-stellar masses from the strength of the EA starburst
ANN I ZABLUDOFF
as inferred from a comparison of the Balmer absorption lines and the
4000A break strengths with stellar population synthesis models Bruzual
 Charlot 1995 If the gas-to-stellar masses of the EA progenitors are
consistent with those of gas-rich disk galaxies and a particular EA is
an S0 or E then we can conclude that a morphological transformation has
occurred
For most of the 21 LCRS EAs the HIH2-to-stellar mass ratios
of a pair of Sa-c spirals provide sucient gas to generate burst strengths
corresponding to 10-30 of the total stellar mass in the EA Note
that we assume a standard Scalo IMF and a star formation eciency ie
fraction of gas converted to stars of 50 or less However for the bluest
three EAs in the sample eg Figure 1 the burst strengths of  50
cannot be reproduced without relaxing some of these assumptions For
example either both merging progenitors are late Sd disks or at least one is
a low surface brightness Malin I type galaxy or the star formation eciency
of the resulting burst is an extraordinary 100 in contrast with the 
50 eciencies of the brightest IRAS ultra-luminous galaxies Although
based on stellar population synthesis models that are still incomplete these
results support the picture that EAs are a phase of galaxy evolution
in which blue star-forming disk galaxies are transformed via galaxy-galaxy
encounters into early type S0 and E galaxies
5 How Common is the EA Phase
Are EAs rare objects or do they represent a short-lived phase in the
evolution of many galaxies From a comparison of the 21 EA spectra
with stellar population synthesis models we estimate that the duration of
the EA phase is  08 Gyr The fraction of galaxies that are EAs in
the nearby universe is 2111113  0002 Therefore at least 4 of galaxies
could have passed through an EA phase within a Hubble time a frac-
tion which would constitute a signicant number of the early types in the
eld We plan to improve this estimate by comparing the HST images HI
maps and follow-up long-slit spectra with simulations of galaxy-galaxy in-
teractions cf Mihos  Hernquist 1994 The internal kinematics and mor-
phological features on small scales should better constrain the time elapsed
since the starburst ended and thus the duration of the EA phase in
galaxies
