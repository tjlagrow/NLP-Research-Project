ABSTRACT
Viscous redistribution of mass in Milky Way-type galactic disks is an appealing way of generating an expo-
nential stellar prole over many scale lengths almost independent of initial conditions requiring only that the
viscous timescale and star formation timescale are approximately equal However galaxies with solid-body ro-
tation curves cannot undergo viscous evolution Low surface brightness LSB galaxies have exponential surface
brightness proles yet have slowly rising nearly solid-body rotation curves Because of this viscous evolution
may be inefcient in LSB galaxies the exponential proles instead would give important insight into initial
conditions for galaxy disk formation
Using star formation laws from the literature and tuning the efciency of viscous processes to reproduce an
exponential stellar prole in Milky Way-type galaxies I test the role of viscous evolution in LSB galaxies Under
the conservative and not unreasonable condition that LSB galaxies are gravitationally unstable for at least a part
of their lives I nd that it is impossible to rule out a signicant rle for viscous evolution This type of model still
offers an attractive way of producing exponential disks even in LSB galaxies with slowly-rising rotation curves

1 INTRODUCTION
An exponential stellar light prole over 4-6 disk scale lengths
is an almost universal observational feature of disk galaxies
eg Freeman 1970 de Jong 1996 Yet the production of
a stellar exponential disk over more than 3 scale-lengths dur-
ing the early stages of galaxy formation can prove highly chal-
lenging eg Dalcanton Spergel  Summers 1997 van den
Bosch 2001 Ferguson  Clarke 2001 although see also Con-
tardo Steinmetz  Fritze-von Alvensleben 1998 Ever since
their inception Lin  Pringle 1987a viscous evolution mod-
els have endured as an attractive way of producing exponential
stellar disks over 4 disk scale lengths almost independent of
the initial density distribution In a differentially rotating gas
disk viscosity caused by non-circular gas motions and turbu-
lence transports angular momentum outwards as mass ows in-
wards Pringle 1981 Lin  Pringle 1987a To prevent viscous
evolution from reaching its logical endpoint all the mass at the
origin all the angular momentum at innity the star forma-
tion SF timescale t should be within half an order of magni-
tude of the viscous timescale1 t  r2 to freeze in a nearly
exponential stellar surface brightness prole over many disk
scale-lengths eg Lin  Pringle 1987a Clarke 1989 Yoshii

Larsen 1992 Firmani Hernandez  Gallagher 1996 Ferguson

where t is the time  is the viscosity  is the angular velocity
and  is the SF rate Lin  Pringle 1987a A brief inspection
of Eqn 1 shows a well-known result in a galaxy without shear
a solid-body rotation curve with ddr  0 there can be no
viscous evolution
1This expression for t only applies in the case of a rotation curve which is
not close to solid body
Bearing this in mind it is interesting to note that recently
published high-resolution 2 H rotation curves for low
surface brightness LSB galaxies are slowly rising and in a
few cases are nearly solid-body within the optical extent of
the galaxy eg de Blok et al 2001 de Blok  Bosma 2002
Matthews  Gallagher 2002 Solid-body rotation curves have
no shear meaning that viscous evolution would not occur Yet
many LSB galaxies have exponential surface brightness proles
over 4 or more disk scale lengths eg McGaugh  Bothun
1994 de Blok van der Hulst  Bothun 1995 Bell et al 2000
This could argue against a signicant role for viscous evolution
in generating the exponential stellar disks of LSB galaxies im-
plying that the structure of at least LSB disks offers important
insight into the initial conditions of galactic disk formation
To understand if constraints on galaxy formation models can
be gleaned from the structure of LSB galaxy disks it is impor-
tant to quantitatively explore this issue The key questions are
i how close to solid-body are the rotation curves of LSB galax-
ies and ii will the same kind of viscous evolution processes
postulated to affect Milky Way-type galaxies be able to capital-
ize on any small departures from solid-body behavior and be
able to generate exponential stellar disks in LSB galaxies
To address this problem I set out in this paper to estimate
the possible effect of viscous evolution in LSB galaxies with
known well-constrained surface brightness proles and rota-
tion curves I make the central assumption that viscous pro-
cesses in LSB galaxies and normal Milky Way-like galaxies
have the same efciency and that any differences in viscous
timescales are the result of different rotation curves and gas
densities only Comparing these viscous timescales for LSB
galaxies with realistic SF timescales eg Bell et al 2000 one
can say whether the same sources of viscosity that are applica-
ble in normal galaxies could affect the evolution of LSB galax-
The plan of this paper is as follows In 2 a brief description
of the model is given In 3 the model is calibrated to pro-
duce an exponential stellar light distribution for the Milky Way
Bell 2002
In 4 the Milky Way-calibrated model is applied to ve LSB
galaxies I present my conclusions in 5 As an aside I discuss
viscosity from gas cloud collisions in Appendix A
2 THE MODEL
To investigate the role of viscous evolution in LSB galaxies
I modify the model of Bell  Bower 2000 to include viscous
evolution Following Lin  Pringle 1987a I adopt a smooth
initial gas surface density distribution gr
gr cid26 01  cosr5h 0  r  5h
r  5h
where r is the radius h approximates the nal exponential
scale-length and 20 is the central surface density the nal ex-
ponential central surface density would be roughly 50 see the
dashed line in Fig 1 The choice of this particular initial pro-
le is arbitrary Yoshii  Sommer-Larsen 1989 demonstrate
that exponential disks are produced by viscous evolution from
any smooth centrally-concentrated initial prole The evolu-
tion of gas density with time as a function of radius is followed
using Eqn 1
SF is followed using either i a gas density-dependent SF
law eg Schmidt 1959   kn
g where k is the rate of SF
at a gas surface density of 1 M pc- 2 and n dictates how
sensitively SF rate depends on gas surface density or ii a
dynamical timescale-dependent SF law eg Kennicutt 1998
  Kgdyn where K is the rate of SF at a gas surface den-
sity of 1 M pc- 2 and dynamical time of 1 Gyr and dyn 
- 1 Gyr is the time taken to orbit the galaxy
616rkpcV km s
at a distance r Both SF laws are reasonably consistent with the
SF rates and histories of present-day spiral galaxies eg Ken-
nicutt 1998 Bell  Bower 2000 In the following values of
k n K and the chemical element yield are xed at the values
quoted in Table 1 of Bell  Bower 2000
At present sources of viscosity in galactic disks are not well-
understood In previous studies the SF and viscous timescales
t and t were directly related where again t only applies
where the rotation curve is not nearly solid body The propor-
tionality constant   tt was constrained to be within half
an order of magnitude of unity in order to produce exponen-
tial stellar disks over 46 disk scale lengths eg Lin  Pringle
1987a Hellsten  Sommer-Larsen 1992 Ferguson  Clarke
2001 In this work I wish to relax this constraint to a certain
extent In particular one of the things that I wish to assess is if
  1 for LSB galaxies as this would imply a minor role for
viscous evolution in LSB galaxies
In this paper I explore viscosity due to gravitational instabil-
ities Since I nd later that viscous evolution in Milky Way-type
and LSB galaxies is efcient with this physically-motivated
prescription it is sufcient to adopt only one viscosity prescrip-
tion for the purposes of this paper Following eg Olivier et
al 1991 I also explored viscosity due to collisions between
gas clouds however I found that cloud-cloud collisions are in-
capable of driving signicant viscous evolution in any spiral
galaxies see Appendix A for the derivation of this result I
therefore do not consider this prescription further Large-scale
gravitational instabilities give a viscosity Lin  Pringle 1987b
g3 where agrav is a con-
Olivier et al 1991   agrav3G22
stant G is the gravitational constant and g is the gas density
in M pc- 2 The epicyclic frequency  in Gyr- 1 is given by
  r ddr24212 I set the viscosity from gravitational
instabilities to zero if the disk is gravitationally stable ie if the
Toomre 1964 Q  1 where Q  vsGg The gas velocity
dispersion vs is assumed to be 6 km s- 1 Kennicutt 1989 Bin-
ney  Tremaine 1987 The constant agrav is set to produce an
exponential stellar disk for the Milky Way essentially  for
the cloud-collision and gravitational instability cases is set to
be  1 see 3 This value of agrav is then left alone and the
LSB galaxy models are run to test if the difference in rotation
curve shape and gas density signicantly affects  This is the
central assumption of this analysis
Stellar populations are modeled using the Bruzual  Charlot
in preparation stellar population synthesis models see eg
Liu Charlot  Graham 2000 adopting a Salpeter IMF with a
reduced number of low mass stars following Bell  de Jong
2001 I adopt the instantaneous recycling approximation and
the closed box approximation Bell  Bower 2000 The de-
tailed viscous ow of metals is not tracked in this model These
approximations do not affect the K-band surface brightness or
B - R color signicantly and therefore will not affect the con-
clusions of this paper It is worth noting that use of the B-band
or stellar mass surface density proles would also not affect the
conclusions of this paper
I solve these equations using a standard rst order explicit
scheme with 50 equally-spaced radius steps between 02h and
10h Time steps are 4 Myr for a galaxy age of 12 Gyr There are
two runs per galaxy model with the different SF laws Follow-
ing eg Lin  Pringle 1987a and Ferguson  Clarke 2001
I allow mass to be lost from the center of the galaxy ie total
galaxy mass is not conserved however in practice less than
10 of the total mass is lost for even large amounts of viscous
evolution This does not signicantly affect my conclusions as
the galaxies with large amounts of viscous evolution are typi-
cally quite luminous and this lost mass is easily accommo-
dated within a bulge component
3 REPRODUCING THE MILKY WAY
For the Milky Way I adopt a at rotation curve at all radii
with V  220 km s- 1 adopting a more realistic rotation curve
in the inner parts does not signicantly change the results I
choose a value of h  282 kpc and 0  200 M pc- 2 resulting
in disk central surface densities of  1000 M pc- 2 see Table
1 for the modeling parameters of this and subsequent galaxy
models These values of V  h and the disk central surface den-
sity are in reasonable accord with observations eg Binney
 Merrield 1998 I assume that the gas disk was assembled
instantaneously 12 Gyr ago assuming more realistic infall his-
tories for any of the models in this paper does not signicantly
change the results A choice of agrav  002 for the gravita-
tional instability model results in a prole which is exponential
to within 011 mag at r  5h for the gas-density dependent SF
law and to within 014 mag for the dynamical time SF law
In both cases B - R  11  002 the gas fraction is 23 
3 and the K-band central surface brightness is 1735  015
mag arcsec- 2 These global parameters are typical of a galaxy
of the Milky Ways luminosity and size eg Bell  de Jong
2000 Variations of agrav by factors of 23 do not signicantly
affect the surface brightness proles of the model Milky Way-
type galaxies they are still exponential to 20 within 4 disk
scale lengths
There are two interesting points which deserve further dis-
cussion Firstly my value of agrav results in much slower vis-
cous evolution than estimated by Olivier et al 1991 Olivier
et al 1991 estimate short viscous timescales 02 Gyr for gas

4 ARE LSB GALAXIES AFFECTED BY VISCOUS EVOLUTION
The stage is now set to address the role of viscous evolution
in LSB galaxies All of the ingredients are in place i accurate
observations of rotation curves for real LSB galaxies with well-
constrained exponential proles required for Equation 1 ii
knowledge about SF timescales in LSB galaxies and plausible
SF laws Bell  Bower 2000 and iii estimates of the ef-
ciency of gravitational instability viscosity in Milky Way-type
galaxies from 3 The central assumption of this comparison is
that the efciency of viscous processes in LSB galaxies is the
same as for Milky Way-type galaxies ie agrav is the same for
all galaxies With this assumption I am postulating that the
physical processes in LSB and Milky Way-type galaxies are
identical and differences in behavior result from differences in
rotation curve and gas density only
I will present the anal-
ysis for one particular LSB galaxy ESO-LV 1870510 before
extending the analysis to a further four suitable LSB galaxies
41 ESO-LV 1870510
ESO-LV 1870510 at a distance of 29 Mpc Bell et al 2000
has a slowly-rising almost solid-body H-derived rotation
curve from de Blok et al 2001 see their Fig 1 and the in-
set panel in Fig 2 Bell et al 2000 present optical and
near-IR photometry their Fig 1 which demonstrates that
the galaxy is exponential to within 01 mag over 4 disk scale
lengths ESO-LV 1870510 has an intrinsic B-band central sur-
face brightness of 237502 mag arcsec- 2 implying nearly a
factor of 10 lower surface density than the canonical 2165
mag arcsec- 2 of Freeman 1970 For the model I adopt the
following smooth approximation to de Bloks smoothed rota-
tion curve V  521 - e- rkpc28 km s- 1 see inset to Fig 2 a
value of 0  16 M pc- 2 and h  346 kpc see also Table 1
Fig 2 shows the resulting K-band surface brightness pro-
les of the density-dependent and dynamical time SF law LSB
model galaxies Clearly the viscous redistribution and SF
timescales turn out to be roughly equal and exponential surface
brightness proles are produced The stellar disks are exponen-
tial to within 007 mag density-dependent SF law or 013 mag
dynamical time SF law within r  4h The model B - R col-
ors match the observations to  01 mag and the scale lengths
magnitudes and central surface brightnesses match the observa-

a gas density-dependent SF law which evolves subject to viscous evolution

face brightness prole the dotted line denotes an exponential t to the sur-
face brightness prole for r  6h the dot-dashed line shows the stargas sur-
face density prole assuming a K-band stellar ML of 1 in solar units and the
dashed line denotes the initial gas density prole again assuming MLK  1
The dynamical time SF law yields similar results
at 8 kpc from the galactic center
In order to keep   1
it is necessary to have SF timescales  02 Gyr These short
timescales violate measured SF timescales in large spiral galax-
ies in general eg Kennicutt 1998 Bell  de Jong 2000 and
in the Milky Way in particular  10 Gyr in the solar cylin-
der Rocha-Pinto et al 2000 In addition their viscous ows
would have velocities  5 km s- 1 violating the  1 km s- 1 con-
straint derived from radial metallicity distributions Lacey 
Fall 1985 Clarke 1989 In stark contrast the low viscous
efciencies that I adopt result in viscous and SF timescales of
 10 Gyr at the solar cylinder and gaseous ow velocities of
 01 km s- 1 well within observational constraints Secondly
the model surface brightness prole is exponential to 10 de-
spite the ratio of the SF and viscous timescales   tt vary-
ing with radius by nearly an order of magnitude This strength-

412 Gravitational Instability and LSB Galaxies
I have demonstrated that viscous evolution through gravita-
tional instability can be just as effective in LSB galaxies as
in Milky Way-type galaxies However this seems to contra-
dict at some level the argument that LSB galaxies are rather
more likely the be gravitationally stable than their higher sur-
face brightness counterparts If LSB galaxies were gravitation-
ally stable no viscous evolution at least through gravitational
instabilities would occur van der Hulst et al 1993 estimate
the Toomre Q parameter nding 1  Q  3 This can be com-
pared to 05  Q  2 for most luminous spiral galaxies in their
inner parts Kennicutt 1989 However there are reasons to
believe that van der Hulst et al 1993 could signicantly over-
estimate Q Toomres Q  1g and poor resolution HI obser-
vations will tend to underestimate g In addition it is unclear
how much molecular hydrogen there is in LSB galaxies due
primarily to the uncertainty in the CO to H2 ratio X see eg
Mihos Spaans  McGaugh 1999 Boselli Lequeux  Gavazzi
2002 a 50 increase in g caused by molecular hydrogen
in the inner few scale lengths is not unreasonable given that
X could be a factor of 10 higher than galactic and given the
level of current CO detections of LSB galaxies Matthews 
Gao 2001 Both of these effects would tend to drive down Q
making LSB galaxies less stable
However the model galaxy has gas densities which are some-
what larger than typical observed densities in LSB galaxies
10 M pc- 2 at the model half-light radius compared to 5
M pc- 2 for observed LSB galaxies This problem can be alle-
viated by allowing the model galaxy to be built up by a lengthy
gas infall Assuming an inside-out formation scenario with an
e-folding timescale of 25 Gyr at the center and 10 Gyr at  4h
the infall case of Bell  Bower 2000 the gas density of the
model galaxy is reduced by a factor of two bringing it much
closer to typical observed gas densities in LSB galaxies How-
ever viscous evolution still occurs producing a stellar expo-
nential disk the viscous evolution basically operates at a level
which keeps the LSB galaxy on the edge of gravitational insta-
bility throughout its life Given the considerable observational
and modeling uncertainties it is not unreasonably conservative
to argue that LSB galaxies are at the edge of gravitational in-
stability for most of their lives note that Mihos McGaugh 
de Blok 1997 also argue for locally unstable LSB disks and
therefore could plausibly undergo signicant viscous evolution
42 Other LSB galaxies
I have demonstrated that it is possible for the LSB galaxy
ESO-LV 1870510 to undergo signicant viscous evolution if it
is gravitationally unstable for at least part of its life
In this
subsection I repeat the analysis with a further four galaxies
with accurate modelled rotation curves de Blok et al 2001
and exponential proles to good accuracy over at least three
disk scale lengths de Blok McGaugh  van der Hulst 1996
Swaters 1999 Bell et al 2000 UGC 11557 F568-3 F583-1
and F583-4 see Table 1 for modeling parameters and Fig 3 for
the results
In all cases the gas disks can be unstable and this leads to sig-
nicant viscous evolution with either the gas density-dependent
or dynamical time-dependent SF law The cloud collision vis-
cosity model gives very little viscous evolution None of the
rotation curves are solid body most rise slowly out to 2h and
turn over at larger radii This is common amongst LSB galaxies
eg de Blok et al 2001 Matthews  Gallagher 2002 The
FIG 2 K-band surface brightness proles of two ESO-LV 1870510 mod-
els which evolve subject to gravitational instability viscosity The gas density-
dependent SF law is shown as a thick solid line and the dynamical time SF
law is shown by a thick dashed line The exponential ts to both models are
also shown thin solid and dashed lines The dotted line denotes the initial gas
density prole assuming MLK  1 Inset is the smoothed rotation curve of de
Blok et al 2001 and my t to the rotation curve solid line
tions to 20 ESO-LV 1870510 lacks literature HI data how-
ever the model gas fraction of 60 is typical of LSB galaxies
eg Bell  de Jong 2000
411 Why Can Viscous Evolution Affect LSB Galaxies
It is interesting to consider why viscous evolution can work
with similar efciency in LSB galaxies and Milky Way-type
galaxies After all the rotation curves of LSB galaxies rise
slowly see eg the inset panel in Fig 2 implying that viscous
evolution could be much less efcient Using that t  r2
t  r232
g Fig 3 of de Jong  Lacey 2000 shows that
Milky Way-type and LSB galaxies have similar scale lengths
therefore characteristic values of r are similar for LSB and
Milky Way-type galaxies see also Table 1 The gas density
g is a factor of  10 lower in LSB galaxies which drives up
t However     V r Binney  Tremaine 1987 is sub-
stantially lower in LSB galaxies as r is similar but V is a factor
of a few lower Consequently 32
g therefore t are similar
for Milky Way-type and LSB galaxies
Considering the rest of Equation 1 we see that the top term
in the equation is reduced for a LSB galaxy by a factor of 100
a factor of 10 from the g term and a factor of 10 from ddr
The bottom term is reduced by a factor of 5 simply due to
the more solid-body rotation curve shape Therefore the ratio
and the derivative of the ratio is roughly a factor of 20 lower
for a LSB galaxy However the gas densities are roughly a
factor of 10 lower so gtg is only reduced by a factor
of 2 or so viscous evolution from gravitational instability will
be nearly as effective in LSB galaxies as it would be in large
spiral galaxies Coupled with the somewhat longer t in LSB
galaxies it is clear that   tt will remain of order unity
easily producing an exponential disk
Exponential Disks in LSB Galaxies
formation laws from the literature and have tuned the efciency
of viscous processes to reproduce an exponential stellar prole
in Milky Way-type galaxies Conservatively I have assumed
that the physics of turbulence are the same in LSB and Milky
Way-type galaxies any differences in the importance of vis-
cous evolution in the two types of galaxy are the product of
differences in rotation curve and gas density only I then apply
this model to LSB galaxies with observed rotation curves and
surface brightness proles Under the conservative and not un-
reasonable condition that LSB galaxies are gravitationally un-
stable for at least part of their lives I nd that viscous evolu-
tion from gravitational instabilities is quite effective Viscous
evolution models still offer an attractive way of producing an
exponential disk over four or more disk scale lengths almost
independent of initial density distribution even for LSB galax-
ies with slowly-rising rotation curves
Does this have implications for the power of surface bright-
ness proles to constrain galaxy formation theory It is impos-
sible at present to predict the degree of viscous evolution that
will occur as the physical mechanisms driving viscous evolu-
tion are so poorly constrained However this paper has shown
that it can plausibly occur in both low and high surface den-
sity disk galaxies and Yoshii  Sommer-Larsen 1989 have
shown that it would modify most intial density proles into
an exponential disk This reduces substantially the ability of
observations to rule out models of galaxy formation based on
surface brightness proles
Indeed the assembly of a disk
with a reasonably centrally concentrated prole with roughly
the right amount of angular momentum is all that is required
of a galaxy formation model However it is impossible to re-
duce the central matter density of a galaxy through viscous pro-
cesses therefore models which overpredict the central mass
density of galaxy disks cannot escape the need for revision or
modication see eg van den Bosch 2001

FIG 3 K-band surface brightness proles of the models of four LSB
galaxies from the sample of de Blok et al 2001 The gas density-dependent
models which evolve due to viscosity from gravitational instabilities are
shown for all galaxies F568-3 has two models shown one with a solid-body
inner rotation curve solid line and one with curvature which is consistent
with the 1 errors in the rotation curve dashed line With the exception of
the solid-body case of F568-3 all surface brightness proles do not deviate
from exponential by more than 01 mag The use of the dynamical time SF
law would not affect the results signicantly
only exception to this is F568-3 which has a rotation curve
within 12h which can be modelled as solid body This leads
to a ring feature in the viscous model surface brightness pro-
le where material piles up at r  h Fig 3 solid line with
stars
If the rotation curve is allowed to curve slightly at
the observational 1 level the nal surface brightness prole
smooths considerably and becomes exponential to within 01
mag RMS Fig 3 dashed line with stars
This strengthens the conclusions considerably it is impossi-
ble to rule out a signicant role for viscous evolution during the
life of ve LSB galaxies with exponential surface brightness
proles for which accurate rotation curves are available from
the literature
5 CONCLUSIONS
Models of galaxy evolution which include viscosity due to
non-circular and turbulent gas motions have for the last 15
years provided a relatively appealing way of producing accu-
rately exponential stellar disks in large spiral galaxies almost
independent of initial conditions The primary assumption is
that the viscous timescale and star formation timescale should
be approximately equal However galaxies with solid-body
rotation curves cannot undergo viscous evolution Low sur-
face brightness LSB galaxies have exponential surface bright-
ness proles yet have slowly rising nearly solid-body rotation
curves Thus it could be that LSB galaxies have had little redis-
tribution of gas due to viscous evolution during their lifetimes
Their surface brightness proles would give unique insight into
the initial conditions of galaxy formation
In this paper I have constrained the importance of viscous
evolution during the life of LSB galaxies I have adopted star

to conclude that viscosity from cloud-cloud collisions will be
unimportant for all spiral galaxies This is because the low ef-
ciency of energy loss in cloud-cloud collisions vrelativevrot2

tend to happen  1 time per orbit for most spiral galaxies
Of course if some mechanism whips up cloud collision ve-
locities such as a galaxy interaction it may be possible to
evolve signicantly from cloud-cloud viscosity but this mecha-
nism should not play a signicant rle in the evolution of spiral
galaxies in their normal quiescent mode

A EXPLORING CLOUD-CLOUD VISCOSITY
Here I briey discuss cloud-cloud collision viscosity De-
spite its frequent use in the literature it has not been com-
prehensively derived and so I will explore it here Following
eg Silk  Norman 1981 and Olivier et al 1991 I assume
a cloud-cloud collision rate R  ncloudvsr2
cloud where ncloud is
the number space density of clouds vs is the gas velocity dis-
persion and rcloud is the typical cloud radius Assuming that
the cloud properties and galaxy scale height are independent of
gas surface density ncloud  gMcloudh where g is the gas
surface density Mcloud is the typical gas cloud mass and h is the
typical gas scale height Adopting the cloud-collision parame-
ters from Olivier et al 1991 R  0032vsg Gyr- 1 where g
is in M pc- 2 and vs is in km s- 1 so far this derivation does not
signicantly deviate from Olivier et al 1991
Following Pringle 1981 the kinematic viscosity takes the
basic form   vs where  is the effective mean free path
of clouds before they collide In the limit that cloud collisions
are much more frequent than once per orbit  is equal to the
mean free path of the clouds which is vsc where c  1R
is the cloud-collision timescale This yields a viscosity  
326freqvsg kpc2 Gyr- 1 In the limit of cloud collisions be-
ing much less frequent than once per orbit   vsrc- 1
where r  vs is the radial excursion during one epicycle
and   2 is the epicycle timescale Pringle 1981 In this
s g2 kpc2 Gyr- 1 where vs is
case   v2
in km s- 1 g is in M pc- 2 and  is in Gyr- 1 Which limit is
adopted depends on g assuming that vs is constant between
different galaxy types For gas densities 25 M pc- 2 the fre-
quent collision case is more appropriate c  200 Myr and for
gas densities 25 M pc- 2 the infrequent case is more appro-
priate c  200 Myr for a constant vs  6 km s- 1
c  131infreqv3
The crucial issue now is to estimate the efciencies freq
and infreq of the frequent and infrequent cloud-cloud collision
cases This is done by estimating the energy loss per cloud-
cloud collision The specic kinetic energy of a cloud is  v2
where vrot is the rotation velocity However clouds collide with
speeds much less than than vrot because they are almost al-
ways in very similar nearly circular orbits In this case the
maximum possible specic energy loss is related to their rela-
tive speeds  v2
relative Therefore the efciency of energy loss
per collision is  vrelativevrot2 The relative velocity vrelative
