ABSTRACT
We investigate the evolution of the galaxy merger rate predicted by two semi-analytical
galaxy formation models implemented on the Millennium Simulation of dark matter structure
growth The fraction of merging galaxy pairs at each time-step of the simulation is derived
from the galaxy catalogues obtained by the models and the results are compared with various
observational estimates of merger fractions taken from the literature We nd a good match
between the pair fractions derived from the simulation and the observed counting of galaxy
pairs obtained by different sources in the redshift range 0  z  12 The predicted evolution
of the number of galaxy mergers per Gyr grows with redshift as an exponential rate given
 1  zm with m ranging from 06 to 08 for 0  z  2 depending on the
luminosity and mass ratios of the merging galaxies Our results are in agreement with recent
observational results that argue for a at evolution in the fraction of galaxy mergers since
z  12 The weak evolution predicted for the galaxy merger rate in an hierarchical model
universe shows that the mass assembly evolution of galaxies through mergers does not follow
the rapid evolution of the halo merger rate obtained in previous studies

1 INTRODUCTION
The role played by galaxy mergers is of paramount importance
for galaxy formation and evolution Since the seminal numerical
work by Toomre  Toomre 1972 galaxy mergers are thought
to be relevant mechanisms in the build up of the spheroidal
component of galaxies Recent numerical works also argue that
gas-rich mergers are able to form disk galaxies Robertson et al
2004 Governato et al 2007 In the local Universe observa-
tions of remnants of galaxy mergers strengthen their effects on
galaxy morphologies and on triggering star formation in merg-
ing galaxies unveiling their power on driving galaxy evolution
eg Jog  Maybhate 2006 Schweizer  Seitzer 2007 Actually
in a recent work Mateus Jimenez  Gaztanaga 2008 show that
galaxy mergers are very correlated to the star formation history of
galaxies driving the environmental dependence in galaxy forma-
tion by regulating the star formation process
The importance of galaxy mergers is highlighted when we
consider the hierarchical build up of cold dark matter CDM struc-
tures according to the standard CDM cosmology which forms the
basis of the subsequent processes related to galaxy formation and
evolution In this picture the structure growth is driven by the hier-
archical accretion and merging of dark matter haloes with galaxies
forming inside these structures following the radiative cooling of
baryons and the condensation of the gas through dissipative cool-
ing White  Rees 1978 It follows that the rate at which galaxy
 E-mail abiliomateusoampfr
mergers evolve is a direct consequence of the hierarchical growth of
structures in any galaxy formation model based on this framework
Predicting this evolution from the models and comparing it to ob-
servations of galaxy mergers at different lookback times represent
therefore a key test to determine whether and how galaxies form
by mergers or whether the models give us the correct predictions
On the observational side the galaxy merger counting is a
challenging effort Two main approaches are used to measure the
evolution of galaxy mergers at low and high-redshift The rst one
is based on the counting of close galaxy pairs which provides re-
liable estimates of major mergers out to z  1 eg Patton et al
1997 Le Fevre et al 2000 Bundy et al 2004 Lin et al 2004
Kartaltepe et al 2007 despite of the selection effects and biases
inherent to this method eg Patton et al 2000 Other way to
counting galaxy mergers is through detecting direct signatures of
galaxy interactions as visual disturbed morphologies or asymme-
tries detected by automated procedures eg Conselice et al 2003
De Propris et al 2007 Lotz et al 2008
In this Letter we examine the galaxy merger rate evolution
predicted by galaxy formation models and its comparison with
observational measurements of merger rates taken from the liter-
ature We use the public data available by the Millennium Sim-
ulation Springel et al 2005 to derive galaxy merger properties
predicted by two semi-analytical galaxy formation models imple-
mented on the simulation and described by Bower et al 2006 and
De Lucia  Blaizot 2007
We present a brief description of the Millennium Simulation
and the semi-analytical models used in this work in Section 2 In

Section 3 we describe the methodology used to estimate galaxy
mergers from the simulation outputs The main results of this work
are presented in Section 4 and our conclusions are summarized on
Section 5
2 THE MODEL UNIVERSES
In this section we briey describe the model universes used in this
work based on one of the largest cosmological simulation of struc-
ture growth carried out so far the Millennium Simulation and on
two state-of-the-art semi-analytical models of galaxy formation de-
veloped by independent groups
The Millennium Simulation of dark matter structure growth
recently carried out by the Virgo Consortium follows the evolu-
tion of N  21603 particles of mass 86  108h1 M within
a co-moving box of size 500h1 Mpc on a side from redshift
z  127 to the present Springel et al 2005 The adopted cos-
mological model is the concordance CDM model with parame-
ters m  025 b  0045 h  073   075 n  1
and 8  09 where the Hubble constant is parametrized as
H0  100h km s1 Mpc1 Haloes and subhaloes in 64 output
snapshots were identied using the SUBFIND algorithm described
in Springel et al 2001 and merger trees were then constructed
that describe how haloes grow as the model universe evolves These
merger trees form the basic input needed by the semi-analytic mod-
els described in the following
We explore the galaxy catalogues obtained by two semi-
analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the Millen-
nium Simulation We use the results obtained by the model pre-
sented and discussed by De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 which is a
modied version of the models used in Croton et al 2006 and
De Lucia et al 2006 The galaxy catalogues generated by this
model have been made public on the Millennium download site
at the German Virtual Observatory1 We also use the model de-
scribed in detail by Bower et al 2006 It is an extension of
the GALFORM model implemented by Cole et al 2000 and
Benson et al 2003 The catalogues generated by this model are
publicly available on the Millennium download site at the Univer-
sity of Durham2
These semi-analytical galaxy formation models have signif-
icant differences in the general procedure to form galaxies from
the dark matter haloes First of all many aspects of the baryonic
physics involved in the galaxy formation process are treated in a
completely different manner mainly those related to the energy
feedback from active galaxy nuclei to regulate the star formation
in galaxies In addition the construction of the merger trees from
the dark matter halo distribution which form the basis of the semi-
analytical approach integrated on the numerical simulations has
been done in independent ways
3 GALAXY MERGER RATES
We derive the predicted evolution of the galaxy merger rate from
the semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented on the
Millennium Simulation We start selecting all z  0 galaxies
with rest-frame absolute magnitudes MB 6 18 resulting in
two base catalogues containing about 333  106 galaxies from
1 httpwwwg-voorgMillennium
2 httpgalaxy-catalogueduracuk8080Millennium
the Bower et al 2006 model and about 435  106 galaxies from
the De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 model For all galaxies in these cata-
logues we recovered their complete merger trees by using the post-
processing facilities carried out on the Millennium databases
The rst step to derive the model predictions for the frac-
tion of galaxies undergoing mergers is to identify the progenitors
of each galaxy selected from the merger trees at each time-step t
of the simulation We then dene that a galaxy has experienced a
merger if it has at least one pair of progenitors at the previous time-
step In other words we are able to select galaxy pairs at a given
t that will merge to form a single galaxy in the immediately pos-
terior time-step This description is particularly interesting if one
wants to compare the results from the simulation with observational
estimates of merger fractions based on pair count statistics eg
Patton et al 2002 Lin et al 2004 Kartaltepe et al 2007 In our
analysis the progenitor pair of a merge-product galaxy is composed
by its main progenitor dened as the progenitor with the largest
stellar mass selected to be brighter than a B-band absolute mag-
B  and an ordinary progenitor with MB 6 18
nitude limit M lim
In our analysis we considered two magnitude limits for the main
progenitors M lim
B  20 in order to in-
spect how this choice affects the derived pair fractions We have
also adopted an additional approach to select galaxy pairs by con-
sidering only the ordinary progenitors with stellar masses larger
than 14 16 and 110 of the main progenitor stellar mass in-
dependently of their luminosity In such analysis we selected only
the main progenitors with MB  20 This procedure allows us
to investigate how the estimated pair fractions depend on the mass
ratio of the pair components
B  195 and M lim
We dene the pair fraction as the number of galaxies in the
progenitor pairs main progenitors plus companions Npz di-
vided by the total number of main progenitors brighter than M lim
Ntz at each time-step of the simulation fpz  NpzNtz
The merge fraction is directly derived from the pair fraction by con-
sidering only the total number of progenitors pairs that will merge
that is fmrgz  05fpz We can directly relate this predicted
merger fraction to observations of close galaxy pairs which are fre-
quently used to derive observed merger fractions From observa-
tions of physically close galaxy pairs one can determine the number
of close companions per galaxy Nc  which is identical to the pair
fraction in a volume-limited sample with no triples or higher order
N-tuples Following the expression adopted by Lin et al 2004 the
galaxy merger rate per Gyr estimated through pair count statistics
is given by
Rmrg  05  GNczPmrgT 1
where Ncz is the average number of companions for galaxies
within the observed magnitude range Pmrg denotes the probabil-
ity that galaxies in close pairs will merge typically assumed to
be 05 and Tmrg is the time-scale for physically associated pairs
to merge The factor 05 is to convert the number of galaxies into
the number of merger events assuming only pairs ignoring triples
and higher order N-tuples The physical galaxy pairs are expected
to merge on the time-scale Tmrg which depends on the intrinsic
characteristics of the pairs such as the relative mass ratio orbit pa-
rameters and on the structure of the merging galaxies thus varying
for each pair eg Conselice 2006 In general one assumes that
Tmrg  05 Gyr a value suggested by simplied models based
on the dynamical friction time-scale and also predicted by N-body
simulations eg Mihos 1995 Patton et al 2000 Conselice 2006
In equation 1 we also include an additional parameter G in-
troduced by Lin et al 2004 to account for differences in sample
selections when comparing merger rates estimated by pair counts
and by morphological approaches Here we will adopt the value of
G  124 determined by Lin et al 2004
In the case of the simulation a merger between one or more
ordinary progenitors and the main progenitor results in the for-
mation of a single galaxy at a posterior time-step Thus we can
evaluate a galaxy merger rate number of galaxy mergers per Gyr
mrgz by dividing the merger fraction at each z by the time in-
terval between the two time-steps associated to the progenitors and
to the new formed galaxy mrgz  fmrgzt1 In the red-
shift range 0  z  1 the mean value of t is 034 Gyr implying
that the progenitor pairs of a given galaxy can be considered as
physical pairs Thus the predicted galaxy merger rate can be easily
compared with that derived from observational data Rmrg based
on pair count statistics
4 RESULTS
In Fig 1 we show the predicted evolution of pair fractions derived
from galaxy formation models fpz and a compilation of obser-
vational results in the redshift range 0  z  12 For the simu-
lation we show results of pair fractions obtained assuming mag-
nitude limits to select the main progenitors of M lim
B  20 top lines The observational
bottom lines and M lim
data points shown in this gure were obtained from estimates us-
ing galaxy pair counts by Patton et al 2002 Lin et al 2004
Bell et al 2006 and De Propris et al 2007 For z  03 we
show the close pair fractions obtained by Patton et al from counting
close dynamical pairs of the CNOC2 survey with luminosities in
the range 22  MB  19 and the result obtained by De Pro-
pris et al for a galaxy sample with 21  MB  5 log h  18
and 0010  z  0123 drawn from the Millennium Galaxy Cat-
alogue At higher redshifts we show the mean value of the close
pair fraction obtained by Bell et al after analysing 04  z  08
galaxies with MB  20 from the COMBO-17 survey and the
pair fractions obtained by Lin et al from analysis of galaxies with
luminosities 22  MB  20 and redshift range 05  z  12
from the DEEP2 redshift survey It is worth noting that we have ad-
justed the values of Lin et al downward by 65 per cent to account
for projection within galaxy groups as suggested by Bell et al
There is a good match between the evolution of the pair frac-
tions predicted by the Bower et al 2006 model and that inferred
by the observational data considering the magnitude limits adopted
to select the main progenitors The model by De Lucia  Blaizot
2007 underpredicts the pair fractions at z  05 showing a de-
creasing evolution which is clearly inconsistent with the behaviour
expected from the observations The evolution of the pair fractions
derived from the Bower et al model is strong at z  03 and be-
comes weak at higher redshifts independent of the value of M lim
adopted to select galaxy pairs The amplitude of the pair fractions is
highly dependent on the value of M lim
B  being higher for pairs con-
taining brighter galaxies This trend is associated with the strong
dependence of the galaxy growth through mergers on stellar mass
Maller et al 2006 Guo  White 2008 We have also compared
our results with the recent measurements of close pair fractions ob-
tained by Kartaltepe et al 2007 who claims for a strong evolution
of the pair fractions since z  12 after analysing the galaxy popu-
lation in the COSMOS eld They adopted photometric redshifts to
select galaxy pairs in the redshift range 01  z  12 with a mag-
nitude limit MV  198 We found a good agreement in the pair

fractions for z  1 For higher redshifts there is an excess in the
pair fractions derived by Kartaltepe et al 2007 inconsistent with
the weak evolution of fpz predicted by the Bower et al model
This discrepancy can be due to the large errors in the photometric
redshifts used to select the pairs and the consequent projection ef-
fects which become more important at higher redshifts We hope
that a future spectroscopic follow-up of their data and other pair
fraction estimates from high-z surveys will help to clarify this is-
In Fig 2 we show the evolution of the merger rates predicted
by the models mrgz and the merger rates derived from the
observations Galaxy merger rates are estimated from the obser-
vational data considering the time-scale Tmrg  05 Gyr for the
measurements from pair counts assuming by simplicity that this
value is characteristic of the merging time-scale for close pairs eg
Patton et al 2000 as discussed in Section 3 For this compari-
son we also added the merger rates estimated from merger anal-
ysis based on galaxies showing morphological distortions This ap-
proach is signicantly distinct to the pair counts analysis since the
mergers are observed after their occurrence see De Propris et al
2007 for a discussion between these two methods We show the
results obtained by Conselice et al 2003 from a morphological
analysis of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field They have detected
ongoing major mergers by measuring an asymmetry parameter
from galaxy images We also show the recent measurements of
morphologically identied galaxy mergers obtained by Lotz et al
2008 from the analysis of galaxies brighter than MB  205
in the HST survey of the Extended Groth Strip Here we adopted a
time-scale of 1 Gyr to derive the merger rates from these morpho-
logical studies
As in Fig 1 there is a good agreement between the observa-

The m  06  08 value obtained for this model is consis-
tent with recent results obtained by different approaches which
gives support for roughly a at evolution of the merger rate
Bundy et al 2004 Lin et al 2004 Lotz et al 2008 The model
by De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 predicts a constant merger rate evo-
lution visibly at odds with the observations and the Bower et al
model results
In Fig 3 we investigate the dependence of the merger rate
on the mass ratio of the pair components We show results for the
Bower et al model from which we selected galaxy pairs with mass
ratios smaller than 41 61 and 101 as described in Section 3
The amplitude of the merger rate derived from the model depends
strongly on the mass ratio adopted to select the pairs and it is com-
patible with the observed one only when we consider a mass ratio
threshold of 101 The t of the results with the same function as
in equation 2 gives m  059 for merger rates derived from pairs
with mass ratios smaller than 101 063 for mass ratios of 61
and 068 for mass ratios of 41 These results are consistent with a
roughly at evolution of the merger rate independently of the mass
ratio threshold adopted

5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In this Letter we have explored galaxy mergers in model universes
drawn from semi-analytical galaxy formation models implemented
on the Millennium Simulation of structure growth From the public
galaxy catalogues and merger trees generated by the Bower et al
2006 and De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 models we retrieved the pair
fractions and the galaxy merger rate number of galaxy mergers
per Gyr and compared their redshift evolution with observational
results in the redshift range 0  z  2
The results from our study indicate that the evolution of the
galaxy merger rate has been discrete since z  2 following an
exponential function given by mrg  1  zm with m rang-
ing from 06 to 08 depending on the luminosity and mass ratios
of the merging galaxies We nd that this behaviour is true only
for the Bower et al model since the model by De Lucia  Blaizot
2007 predicts a null merger rate evolution m  0 at odds
with the observations and the Bower et al trends The results for
the De Lucia  Blaizot 2007 model can be related to the study
carried out by Guo  White 2008 on the galaxy growth through
mergers and star formation based on it where they have found a
nearly constant growth by mergers in the range 0  z  2 inde-
pendent of the galaxy stellar mass
The weak evolution of the galaxy merger rate found in our
analysis is consistent with recent observational results obtained by
different approaches which give support for a at evolution of the
galaxy merger rate with m  05 1 Bundy et al 2004 Lin et al
2004 Lotz et al 2008 Previous studies have shown that in the hi-
erarchical framework the merger rate of cold dark matter haloes
increases rapidly with redshift also as 1  zm but with the
exponent m  2  3 eg Gottlober Klypin  Kravtsov 2001
Fakhouri  Ma 2007 However as discussed by Berrier et al
2006 multiple galaxies may occupy the same parent dark matter
halo resulting that the predicted galaxy merger rate should evolve
slower than the halo merger rate Actually in the present work we
