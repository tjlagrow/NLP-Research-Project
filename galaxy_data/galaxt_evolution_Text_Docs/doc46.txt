Abstract
Representing single stellar populations globular clusters GCs are rel-
atively easy to model thus providing powerful tools for studying the evolu-
tion of galaxies This has been demonstrated for the blue compact galaxy
ESO338-IG04 GC systems in galaxies may be fossils of starbursts and
mergers Thus studies of GCs in the local universe may add to our under-
standing of the formation and evolution of galaxies and the distant universe
1 Introduction  Globular cluster formation and destruction
Globular clusters GCs are in general old stellar systems with masses 104
to 107M  and are believed to be among the rst ingredients to form
in the process of galaxy formation Thus understanding how GCs form is
vital for understanding how galaxies form Extragalactic GC systems in eg
elliptical E galaxies often have bimodal colour distributions indicating
the presence of populations with dierent metallicity andor age Studies
of merging galaxies eg the Antennae Whitmore and Schweizer 1995
and NGC 7252 Miller et al 1997 have shown that these often contain
young GC candidates in great numbers These galaxies are believed to
evolve into E galaxies as the merger remnants relax The GC candidates
in the more evolved mergers have redder colours indicating higher ages
Very young so-called super star clusters SSCs have been found in many
starburst galaxies including dwarfs eg Meurer et al 1995 The SSCs have
properties which largely agree with those expected for young GCs although
the masses are quite uncertain and are probably younger examples of the
objects seen in the mergers The triggering mechanism for the starbursts in

the dwarfs that host SSCs is still an open question but dwarf mergers are
not ruled out SSCs have also been found in the centres and circum-nuclear
rings in giant barred spirals eg Barth et al 1995 and Kristen et al 1997
In conclusion young globular cluster candidates are found in extreme
and energetic environments indicating that they can only be formed under
special conditions The coeval formation of many GCs will require extreme
conditions eg very high pressures and gas densities Elmegreen and Efre-
mov 1997 conditions which are fullled in mergers Moreover bars trigger
gas ows and nuclear rings may be created by dynamical resonances en-
hancing the density A newly formed GC will not automatically become an
old GC like the ones in our Galaxy as time goes by but faces the risk
of destruction and dissolution Their ability to survive depends on their
interaction with their environment but also on their IMF A galactic bar
for instance is not a favourable place for GC survival since strong shocks
will easily disrupt many young GCs The conditions in mergers and in
particular dwarf galaxies may be more favourable for GC survival
2 Young and old GCs in ESO 338-IG04
ESO338-IG04 is a blue compact galaxy BCG A BCG is characterised
by compact appearance and HII region like spectra indicating high star
formation rates and in general low chemical abundances Most BCGs are
dwarf galaxies that for some reason presently are undergoing starbursts
HSTWFPC2 images reveals that ESO338-IG04 hosts a very rich popu-
lation of compact star clusters counting more than one hundred objects
 Ostlin et al 1998 The centre is crowded with young SSCs but in addi-
tion lots of intermediate age and old objects are found outside the starburst
region there might well be some in the centre as well but they drown in
the light from young SSCs Photometric modelling using Salpeter and
Miller-Scalo IMFs indicates masses in the range 104 to more than 107M 
and a wide range of ages from a few Myr up to 10 Gyr see Fig 1 The
spread in ages is real and not caused by observational errors Moreover
there are groupings in the age distribution indicating that the cluster for-
mation history has not been continuous Most apparent is of course the
numerous very young and luminous SSCs but perhaps even more interest-
ing is the presence of one or two populations of massive GCs with age 2 to 5
Gyr This population when corrected for objects below the detection limit
shows that starburst progenitor had a specic frequency SN a measure of
the number of GCs relative to the host galaxy luminosity comparable to
those of giant Es In addition there are old  10 Gyr and 05 Gyr GCs
present Follow up spectroscopy of two GC candidates in ESO338-IG04 con-
rms the the results from photometry  Ostlin et al 1998c in preparation

forming all objects to an age of 9 Gyr right The results are based on a standard Salpeter
IMF but are very similar for a Miller-Scalo IMF  Ostlin et al 1998a
The dynamics and morphology of this galaxy indicates that a dwarf merger
is responsible for the starburst  Ostlin et al 1998a 1998b Thus we have
a splendid low luminosity MB  19 counterpart of the giant mergers
mentioned above Even if young GCs of course may disrupt or dissolve the
presence of intermediate age GCs proves that GC formation is not a phe-
nomenon that was isolated to the very earliest days of galaxy formation
SSCs are often found in BCGs which suggest that they might be a good
laboratory for studying GC formation and a closer look for aged GCs may
provide important information on previous bursts
3 GCs as starburst fossils
We have seen that objects which are likely to be young GCs have been
found in galaxies which are starbursts andor mergers The presence of
intermediate age GCs in ESO338-IG04 and somewhat aged objects in the
merger remnants suggest that at least a considerable fraction of young GCs
will survive It is a general property of starbursts to reveal the presence of
SSCs when studied at high spatial resolution R136 the central cluster in 30
Dor may perhaps be the closest example of a GC in the making Even if not
all SSCs become GCs we can conclude that all newly formed GCs must
have properties similar to SSCs Moreover the coeval formation of many
massive GCs would produce a starburst in itself Let us illustrate this in a
gure Fig 2 A starburst leads to SSCs of which at least a fraction becomes
GCs and the reverse is also true although SSCs may form also in bars
which however are hostile environments Therefore the age distribution of
the GC population can be used to infer the SSC and thus starburst history
It is also clear that mergers are capable of trigger starbursts but we do not
know yet if a merger is required for the occurrence of a global starburst in
a galaxy If that would be the case GC populations could be used to trace
the merger history of galaxies Of course the question marks in Fig 2 must

be straightened out before GCs can be used as general probes
Although GCs provide information on the starbursts history of galaxies
they do not necessarily tell us about the overall star formation history
afterall GC free galaxies exist There is obviously two dierent modes of star
formation the violent starburst mode which favours cluster formation
and the quiet mode that may still produce the bulk of the eld stars in
most galaxies Van den Bergh 1998 In nearby galaxies the star formation
history SFH of the eld population can be studied through deep colour
magnitude diagrams cf Tolstoy this volume In most galaxies however
one has to infer the overall SFH from the integrated stellar population
A GC is much easier to model because it represents a true single coeval
on the scale of a few Myrs stellar population Spectroscopy can be used
to investigate metallicities to circumvent the age-metallicity degeneracy
Thus GCs can serve as excellent probes for unveiling the starburst history
in moderately distant galaxies But also a more complete picture of the
GC content in local galaxies would provide important information This
might be of importance for interpreting deep surveys which often are biased
towards starburst galaxies Depending on how strong the connection to
mergers will prove to be GC populations may also be useful for studying
the morphological and number evolution of the galaxy population
