Abstract This talk discusses the growing impact of Chandra observa-
tions on the study of galaxies In particular we address progress in the
study of X-ray source populations in diverse galaxies and in the study of
the hot ISM
Introduction
This talk is a compendium of early Chandra Weisskopf et al 2000 results
published and in progress and a preliminary view of data available in the pub-
lic Chandra archive As demonstrated by the large amount of discussion on
feedback models in this meeting and simulations of Chandra-like images the
subarcsecond resolution of Chandra combined with its spectral resolution is
going to provide unique answers to the eld of galaxy and cluster ecology and
evolution Chandras resolution is optimal for the study of galaxies in X-rays
Chandras beam is 100 times smaller than that of any past or planned X-ray
mission and provides a linear physical size resolution of less that 2 pc for Local
Group galaxies and of 30 pc at the Virgo cluster distance Given the relatively
small number and sparse distribution of luminous X-ray sources expected in a
normal galaxy a few hundred at most in the Milky Way and M31 down to
X-ray luminosities of 1036ergss Watson 1990 Supper at al 2001 confusion is
seldom a problem when observing galaxies in the local Universe with Chandra
Moreover the small beam translates into very ecient source detection since
the background contribution in the beam is virtually nil in most cases 10 counts
make a very signicant source With these capabilities Chandra is opening up
the eld of X-ray population studies in galaxies and at the same time provides
the best facility for in-depth detailed studies of the diuse hot interstellar emis-
sion These are the two aspects of Chandra results on galaxies that I will discuss
in this talk
2 X-ray Source Populations
Population studies are often used in astronomy to both constrain the physical
characteristics of a class of sources and to study their evolution While statis-
tical studies of the global X-ray properties of galaxies and of their relation to
the overall galaxian emission could be pursued with pre-Chandra capabilities
eg see Fabbiano 1989 Eskridge et al 1995 Shapley et al 2001 the study of
the properties of the X-ray sources within a galaxy had to be restricted to the
G Fabbiano
most nearby galaxies Even so it was clear that this approach had lots of po-
tential As I rst pointed out in 1995 Fabbiano 1995 X-ray source population
studies are best done outside of the Milky Way observations of external galax-
ies provide complete samples of X-ray sources without the biases in distance
and line of sight absorption inherent to Galactic source studies The rst such
studies with Einstein followed by similar work with ROSAT showed that the
luminosity functions of X-ray sources may vary in dierent galaxies although
systematic eects connected to morphology or star formation activity could
not be discerned at the time A peculiar result that was pointed out early on
see Fabbiano 1989 and revisited periodically since was the presence of ultra-
luminous or super-Eddington sources in some galaxies These are sources with
X-ray luminosities well above the Eddington limit for an accreting neutron star
 13  1038ergss suggesting the presence of 10-100s solar mass black holes
Although overall one could not discriminate between single sources and clumps
of emission in a few cases variability and spectral variability results pointed to
compact X-ray binaries Makishima 1994 Fabbiano 1995
The rst results with Chandra have indeed conrmed a variety of functional
shapes for the X-ray Luminosity Functions XLF of galaxian X-ray sources
and have also uncovered very signicant populations of Ultra-Luminous X-ray
sources ULX in star-forming galaxian regions A brief summary of individual
results follows
M33  The Local Group Sc galaxy M33 has been surveyed with ACIS on
Chandra McDowell et al
in preparation Since this galaxy covers an area
of the sky signicantly larger than the ACIS eld of view a series of dierent
pointings was needed So far  23 of M33 has been observed with Chandra
resulting in  120 sources with luminosities ranging from  1039ergss the
well-known luminous X-ray nucleus nucleus down to a threshold luminosity
of a few  1035ergss Excluding the nucleus all the point-like sources in this
galaxy have sub-Eddington luminosities for a 1 M accretor Pending more ac-
curate estimates of the completeness at lower luminosities there is a suggestion
of attening near the detection threshold Comparison of images in dierent
spectral bands shows a variety of X-ray colors spectral parameters for the
X-ray sources
M81  The Sb galaxy M81 at a distance of 35 Mpc has overall optical prop-
erties very similar to those of M31 Andromeda from which it diers chiey
because of its active mini-Seyfert nucleus that is also the dominant X-ray source
Einstein observations however suggested that M81 has an intrinsically more lu-
minous XLF than M31 Fabbiano 1988a Chandra ACIS observations of the
central 83x83 eld of this galaxy Tennant et al 2001 resulted in the detection
of 97 point-like sources down to a limiting luminosity of  4  1036ergss Ten-
nant et al derive XLFs for the X-ray sources associated with the galactic disk and
bulge separately These two XLFs dier while the disk XLF follows a power-
law over the entire observed range extending to super-Eddington luminosities
the bulge XLF is steeper attening out at luminosities below  1037ergss
These dierent shapes conrm that bulge and disk X-ray sources belong indeed
to dierent populations as suggested from Galactic studies see Watson 1990

E and SO galaxies  The presence of a bulge-like population of X-ray binaries
in early-type galaxies and their eect on the overall X-ray emission was rst
suggested by Trinchieri  Fabbiano 1985 see also eg Fabbiano et al 1994 Pel-
legrini  Fabbiano 1994 for a discussion of their eect on the X-ray luminosity
of X-ray faint E and S0s and has been controversial till now Although deep
ROSAT HRI observations detected some luminous sources in NGC 5128 Turner
et al 1997 and NGC 1399 Paolillo et al 2001 it is only with Chandra that a
clear uncontroversial picture of the X-ray emission of early type galaxies can
be obtained A population of point-like sources is readily visible in the Chandra
images of NGC 5128 Centaurus A where 63 sources were detected in the rst
HRC image Kraft et al 2000 Rich populations of point-like sources are also
detected in the E NGC 4697 Sarazin et al 2001 Fig 1 and S0 NGC 1553
Blanton et al 2001 and account for  12  23 of the X-ray emission of
these X-ray-faint galaxies The XLFs of NGC 4697 and NGC 1553 both have a
break at  3  1038ergss the Eddington luminosity of a neutron star binary
The Chandra image of NGC 1399 reveals a rich population of luminous X-ray
sources prevalently associated with globular clusters Angelini et al 2001
Actively Star-Forming Galaxies  The XLFs of starburst galaxies tend to be
skewed towards higher X-ray luminosities when compared with those of more
aged systems Examples include NGC 40389 the Antennae Fabbiano et al
2001 Zezas et al in preparation M82 Zezas et al 2001 NGC 3256 Lira et
al 2001 and more increasingly being added to the Chandra database Perhaps
the most impressive XLF is that of the merging system NGC 40389 where 49

point-like sources are detected with Chandra with luminosities ranging from 1038
to 1040 ergss There are 14 point-like ULXs sources with LX  1039 ergss A
number of these sources are also detected in the nuclear region of M82 including
the exceptionally luminous variable source discussed by Kaaret et al 2001
and Matsumoto et al 2001 and interpreted as a intermediate-mass 100s M
black hole binary The X-ray spectra of the luminous sources in the Antennae
are hard and can be tted with a composite power-law  accretion disk model
reminiscent of the spectra of ultra-luminous sources in more nearby galaxies eg
Makishima 2000 Kubota 2001 La Parola et al 2001
Fig 2 compares the XLFs of the actively star-forming galaxies M82 and
NGC40389 with the XLF of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4697 Sarazin et al
2001 and that of the disk of M81 Tennant et al 2001 The XLF of NGC 4697
is denitely steeper than the others and in this resembles that of the bulge
of M81 Tennant et al 2001 This overall dierence in shape may be related
to the lack of short-lived very luminous sources in older stellar systems What
are these ultra-luminous sources Although variability and spectra suggest that
they are compact binary systems Zezas et al in preparation the jury is still
out on the nature of the accretor in these binaries are they intermediate-mass
black holes see above or - more likely- less extreme objects in beamed X-ray
sources King et al 2001
I am sure that in the years to come the study of X-ray populations in
galaxies will become an increasingly used tool for understanding properties and
evolution of X-ray binaries and their relation to the parent stellar population
Work is already underway on deep images of spiral galaxies eg the work by
A Prestwich and collaborators and more data are sure to become available in
the near future

3 Hot gaseous emission
Hot Inter-Stellar Medium ISM can be uniquely detected and studied in X-
rays This hot ISM is found in all kinds of galaxies and its study may give us
information on i galaxy structure eg the binding mass of Elliptical galax-
ies eg Fabricant  Gorenstein 1983 ii ecology by measuring the ux of
metal-enriched material from galaxies to the intergalactic medium via galactic
winds and iii evolution as a way for star formation to aect the energy and
entropy balance of clusters and their components see simulations discussed in
this meeting With Chandra we can separate the soft diuse hot ISM emission
from the harder point-source contribution both spatially and spectrally and we
can do detailed spatialspectral studies of the hot ISM
31 Hot ISM and Superwinds in Starforming Galaxies
Starburst galaxies can be spectacular X-ray emitters since the enhanced star
formation activity results in enhanced X-ray emission and in hot gaseous plumes
and galaxian superwinds in the most extreme cases eg Fabbiano 1988b Ex-
amples of this type of galaxies observed with Chandra include M82 NGC 40389
Fabbiano et al 2001 NGC 253 Strickland et al 2000 and NGC 3256 Lira et
al 2001
In NGC 40389 besides the population of bright point-like sources already
mentioned we detect a soft diuse emission with a typical optically thin plasma
emission spectrum Fabbiano et al 2001 accounting for about 12 of the total
X-ray emission  11041ergss This emission consists of a patchy component
associated with the star-forming knots and a lower surface brightness compo-
nent extending throughout the system The extended emission component can
be detected farther South than the stellar disks suggesting a galaxian outow
or superwind
The angular resolution of the Chandra mirrors is such that it is meaningful
to pursue direct comparison between Chandra and Hubble data A comparison
between the ISM component of NGC 40389 and the warm ISM visible in H
using archival HST WFPC data suggests a complex and varied multi-phase
ISM While there is a general resemblance of the spatial distribution of the X-ray
and H emission we note both regions where the two surface brightnesses closely
follow each others and regions where hot superbubbles ll-in holes in the H
distribution Fabbiano et al 2001 The superbubbles we observe in the ISM
of the Antennae galaxies are extraordinary if we compare them with similar
features in the ISM of more normal galaxies Typical X-ray luminosities of
bright X-ray superbubbles are in the few1039ergss range comparable with the
entire thermal emission of the nucleus of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253
Fabbiano 1988b and  20 times more luminous than 30 Dor
These observations of nearby active star-forming galaxies provide the de-
tailed data needed to calibrate models of the eect of stellar formation and
evolution on the ISM of galaxies They also provide a local laboratory for the
phenomena occurring at the epoch of galaxy formation

32 The Feature-rich ISM of Early-type Galaxies
The presence of large amounts of ISM in E and S0 galaxies was an X-ray dis-
covery This ISM is hot and was rst convincingly detected with the Einstein
Observatory A short history of the observations and modelling of this ISM
and the ensuing controversies can be found in Fabbiano  Kessler 2001 With
Chandra we are obtaining a new detailed look that reveals a wealth of structure
in what were by-and-large considered fairly uniform hot halos shaped by the
galaxys gravitational eld Examples of disturbed hot halos are provided by
the Chandra observations of NGC 4636 NGC 5044 and NGC 4697
NGC 4636  This Virgo elliptical is one of the galaxies with largest most
extended X-ray halos The Chandra observation proposed by R Mushotzky
data are now in the public Chandra archive reveals both a rich population
of individual galactic X-ray sources including a ring-like concentration in the
nuclear region and a strongly dened 8 kpc long spiral-like feature in the X-
ray halo Fig 3 Recently Jones et al 2001 propose that this structure may
be due to shocks driven by a past nuclear outburst Ciotti and Ostriker 1997
2001 developed a model in which recurrent outburst and cooling ow accretion
episodes may occur in early-type galaxies giving rise to AGNquiescent cycles
NGC 5044  This elliptical galaxy observed by P Goudfrooij and also in the
Chandra public archive provides another example of a large centrally disturbed
X-ray halo Fig 4 In this case a central radio source is present and the X-
ray feature could be related to it A disturbed inner halo is also present in
NGC 1399 another early-type galaxy with nuclear radio emission where some
of the features suggest interaction between radio lobes and hot ISM Paolillo et
al 2000
NCG 4697  This is the X-ray faint galaxy whose X-ray source population was
discussed earlier in this paper Fig 1 As reported by Sarazin et al 2001 the
Chandra image also shows a soft extended component of the X-ray emission
This hot ISM does not follow the general symmetry of the stellar distribution
but it is both more extended in its radial behaviour and warped suggesting
some dynamical interaction
Clearly these are only a few rst results It is not dicult to predict based
on these data that Chandra observations of the gaseous component of E and S0
galaxies will provide novel insight on their evolution and physical properties
4 Conclusions
It is certainly way too soon to evaluate the eect of high spatialspectral res-
olution Chandra X-ray observations in our understanding of galaxies and their
environment since only a very small amount of data have been fully analyzed
and more observations are continually being done However a rst look shows
that Chandra has more than fullled its promises
High resolution spectrally-resolved images have solved many outstanding
issues in a very direct and simple way Most of these issues were connected
with the interpretation of lower resolution data of E and S0 galaxies
pleased to say that the conclusion put forward by me and my collaborators

that all E and S0 galaxies have a baseline X-ray emission from point-like X-
ray binaries in addition to a varying amount of hot ISM eg Trinchieri and
Fabbiano 1985 Eskridge et al 1995 Pellegrini  Fabbiano 1994 has withstood
the high resolution test and is no longer controversial Chandra images are also
revealing interesting features in the hot halos of these galaxies that suggest
either external interactions or the eect of nuclear activity Studies of the X-ray
populations of galaxies that can provide a direct probe of the massive stellar
component and its evolution as well as of the properties of matter in its most
extreme form neutron stars black holes were merely an intriguing future
possibility see Fabbiano 1995 and are now reality Given the relatively sparse
nature of luminous X-ray sources in galaxies individual sources can be now
studied in galaxies as far as Virgo and beyond where only population synthesis
can be performed of the normal stellar population
With Chandra X-ray observations have become an important tool of main-
stream astrophysical research
