ABSTRACT
In a companion paper we outlined a methodology for generating
parameter-free model-independent no-evolution elds of faint galaxy images
demonstrating the need for signicant evolution in the HDF at faint magnitudes
Here we incorporate evolution into our procedure by transforming the input
bright galaxy images with redshift for comparison with the HDF at faint
magnitudes Pure luminosity evolution is explored assuming that galaxy surface
brightness evolves uniformly at a rate chosen to reproduce the I-band counts
This form of evolution exacerbates the size discrepancy identied by our
no-evolution simulations by increasing the area of a galaxy visible to a xed
isophote Reasonable dwarf-augmented models are unable to generate the count
excess invoking moderate rates of stellar evolution A plausible t to the counts
and sizes is provided by mass-conserving density-evolution consistent with
small-scale hierarchical growth where the product of disk area and space density
is conserved with redshift Here the increased surface brightness generated by
stellar evolution is accomodated by the reduced average galaxy size for a wide
range of geometries These models are useful for assessing the limitations of
the HDF images by calculating their rates of incompleteness and the degree
of over-counting Finally we demonstrate the potential for improvement in
quantifying evolution at fainter magnitudes using the HST Advanced Camera
with its superior UV and optical performance

Introduction
Deep HST images have proven dicult to interpret One might have imagined that
clear pictures of the distant Universe would speak for themselves revealing directly how
galaxies formed and evolved Instead interpretation has been hampered by our ignorance
of the UV properties of local galaxies In a companion paper Bouwens Broadhurst 
Silk 1998 BBS-I we showed how this problem can be overcome using a redshift-complete
sample of bright galaxies contructed from the UV-optical HDF images and follow-up
spectroscopy Clear evolutionary trends were identied by projecting this bright sample to
much fainter magnitudes in a purely empirical and model-independent way In the present
paper we explore simple models for evolution by modifying our procedure to generate
realistic deep elds for exploring the question of evolution to magnitudes far fainter than
accessed by spectroscopy We commence with nearby galaxies and project them back
into the past modifying the number surface brightness and sizes of the images in ways
designed to embody both luminosity and density evolution and to explore the possible
role of dwarf galaxies These simple image transformation models represent a heuristic
alternative to other more complicated evolutionary approaches with more model-dependent
and parameter-laden representations of galaxies at both low and high redshift
At present this empirical modelling is still a more reliable guide to the process of
galaxy evolution than that derived from numerical work in the context of the hierarchical
models for the growth of structure High-resolution codes which simulate the gravitational
interactions of gas and cold dark matter and incorporate cooling following standard atomic
physics produce small dense and rapidly rotating disks in the center of massive haloes
Navarro  White 1994 Navarro  Steinmetz 1997 Of course ad-hoc heat input from
supernovae can presumably be added to achieve larger disks but nonetheless even with
this level of freedom the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies such as DDO154 Carignan 
Freeman 1988 and other newly discovered dwarfs Cote Freeman  Carignan 1997 defy
simple explanation Navarro Frenk  White 1996 Burkert  Silk 1997 Semi-analytic
attempts to mock up hierarchical evolution cf Baugh Cole  Frenk 1996 Kaumann
Guiderdoni  White 1994 though providing interesting interpretations through which to
understand the various observables relevant to galaxy formation and evolution still include
many free parameters Improved modelling of the observations will undoubtedly require a
deeper understanding of the interplay of physical processes relevant to star formation
In 1 we describe our models for evolution and compare them with the HDF
observations in 2 In 3 we discuss the results and in 4 we present our conclusions
and discuss future prospects As in BBS-I we adopt H0  50 kmsMpc and express
 3 
all magnitudes in this paper in the AB1 magnitude system dened in terms of a at
spectrum in frequency Also to associate the HDF bands with their more familiar optical
counterparts we shall refer to the F 814W  F 606W  F 450W  and F 300W bands as I814
V606 B450 and U300 respectively throughout this paper
2 Standard Models
We present simple augmentations to our procedure for generating realistic deep
elds as described in detail in BBS-I We incorporate the usual phenomenological models
proposed to explain the number counts pure luminosity evolution mass-conserving
density evolution and the contribution of an evolving low-luminosity dwarf population
all of which have been claimed to be important for matching the number counts at faint
magnitudes We proceed by performing simple scalings of the images of our bright HDF
galaxy sample see BBS-I in surface brightness size and the space density in the simplest
manner possible in order to achieve rough agreement with the number counts in the I814
Unfortunately by virtue of its size our bright HDF sample lacks low luminosity
galaxies and therefore dwarfs are necessarily included in an ad-hoc manner requiring that
we specify in addition to their evolution their image proles and luminosity functions This
latitude has generated a large literature on their potential contribution Kron 1982 Cowie
Songaila  Hu 1991 Gronwall  Koo 1995 Ferguson  McGaugh 1995 Driver  Phillips
1996 In the present work we have chosen to consider a somewhat conservative maximal
estimate of this contribution using constraints on the faint end slope of the LF from recent
redshift surveys
21 Luminosity Evolution
To obtain a rough idea of the eect of luminosity evolution on deep eld images we
modify our simulation procedure to include a simple 1  zb scaling in surface brightness
a very simple prescription for obtaining fair agreement with the number counts in the I814
band to some specied magnitude limit Of course one could model this form of evolution
with more sophistication using the usual assumptions Pozzetti Bruzual  Zamorani 1996
Ferguson  Babul 1998 even implementing it on a pixel-by-pixel basis where the observed
1mAB  25 log fergcmcmsHz  4860 Oke 1974
 4 
pixel colours could be used to model the spatial history of star formation However we have
decided not to pursue this here because of the many additional assumptions required and
the simple fact that such models as we will illustrate would inevitably seem to produce
galactic populations with sizes that are too large In BBS-I such a trend toward small sizes
was already evident
22 Density Evolution
To estimate the manner in which density evolution would alter the predictions of
our empirical no-evolution method for simplicity we have chosen to scale the number
densities of each bright galaxy in the sample as 1  zQ without changing their relative
proportions To make this simple model sensible we decrease the metric sizes subject to
the simple constraint that the integrated mass is preserved similar to the models proposed
by Rocca-Volmerange  Guiderdoni 1990 and Broadhurst Ellis  Glazebrook 1992
For disk galaxies this simply translates into the requirement that galaxies change in area
at a rate 1  zQ inversely proportional to the space density evolution As discussed
in Broadhurst et al 1992 it is also necessary in the context of this simple merger
prescription to add luminosity evolution since otherwise the number counts are virtually
unaected We also parameterize this luminosity evolution as a 1  zb scaling
We shall avoid consideration here of various arguments against this scenario for which
high rates of merging are claimed to be problematic Toth  Ostriker 1992 Lacey  Cole
1993 Dalcanton 1993 Roukema  Yoshii 1993 recognising that from a purely empirical
perspective this model has considerable intrinsic appeal
For both the luminosity evolution and density evolution models we have listed the
best-t parameters in Table 1 Except for simple scalings in number density size and
surface brightness we performed these simulations in an identical manner to that described
in BBS-I using the Coleman Wu  Weedman 1980 SED templates Note that we
self-consistently derived Vmax and the number densities for each geometry and evolutionary
scenario For the purposes of illustration we present our pure luminosity simulations in
Figure 1 for three dierent geometries   09  01   01   1 and an HDF
density evolution simulation in Figure 2

23 Low-Luminosity Galaxies
Currently our input bright galaxy sample does not extend faintward of Mbj  18
Consequently we have included a model low-luminosity population to explore the potential
role of a dwarf population Such a model is particularly important to explore since it is
well understood that in the absence of evolution the low-luminosity galaxies comprise an
increasing contribution to the counts at faint magnitudes by virtue of their relatively small
k-corrections and the increasing volume available to these galaxies relative to the more
luminous galaxies particularly for large  Kron 1982
Given the latitude of possible models permissible for the low luminosity galaxies
we shall simply use the same luminosity function initial mass functions IMF and star
formation histories as are given in the Pozzetti et al 1996 pure luminosity evolution
model for the Sabc and Sdm spectral types except that we shall adopt a normalization
which is 50 higher than the value prescribed in Pozzetti et al 1996 and we truncate
the luminosity function at absolute magnitudes bj  18 brightward of which our bright
HDF sample see BBS-I is well-represented Our low-luminosity population already
overproduces the low-redshift galaxies in the CFRS but might be tolerated depending
on where this surveys 19 incompleteness lies in redshift These dwarfs are all endowed
with exponential proles with a bj  2265 magarcsec2 central surface brightness We
have intentionally chosen a central surface brightness lower than the commonly observed
central surface brightness of 2165 bj magarsec2 typical of high luminosity objects as a
way to conservatively account for the claimed correlation between surface brightness and
luminosity McGaugh  de Blok 1997 A summary of the parameters used in this model
is provided in Table 2
Although there continues to be debate about the importance of low luminosity galaxies
both locally and in the past we feel that our treatment of dwarfs is generous pushing the
limits of what is supported by observation Relative to other determinations of the local
eld galaxy luminosity function we have a fairly high normalization and a relatively steep
faint-end slope 124 much like the LF claimed by the fairly deep ESP survey of Zucca
et al 1997 and steeper than the well dened APM luminosity function of Loveday et al
1992 At fainter magnitudes no redshift survey has ever shown as many low redshift
objects as one would expect if the density of dwarfs was much larger than this Broadhurst
Ellis  Shanks 1988 Glazebrook et al 1995a Cowie et al 1996 Lilly et al 1995 Ellis et
al 1996 Heyl et al 1997 Indeed with regard to the observed distribution of redshifts
from the CFRS our generous model for the low-luminosity population of galaxies already
generates a  50 excess at the low redshift end Despite these constraints a larger
population of dwarfs could in principle be admitted within these observational constraints
 6 
by adopting a much steeper slope to the luminosity function a possibility for which there
has been some recent support Loveday 1997
For this model we have generated Monte-Carlo catalogues and simulated images in
U300 B450 V606 and I814 equal in area to 4 times that of the HDF The dwarfs are placed
on the image at random positions and inclination angles assuming no extinction and
smoothed with an unsaturated relatively isolated stellar PSF taken from the HDF Then
both poissonian and sky noise are placed on the images after applying the noise kernel to
reproduce the drizzled properties of the noise We calculate the colours for these galaxies
with their chosen star-formation histories using a recent version of the Bruzual  Charlot
spectral synthesis tables compiled in Leitherer et al 1996 see Charlot Worthey 
Bressan 1996 for a description of these type of models We recover objects o the resulting
dwarf-augmented images using SExtractor in exactly the same manner that we recover
objects from the HDF
3 Results
31 Number Counts in the I814 band
As in BBS-I we begin by examining the number counts derived from the above models
in the I814 band due to relatively small uncertainties inherent in determining the uxes each
of the input galaxies would have to z  3 in this band The pure bolometric luminosity
evolution results are presented in Figure 3 as a dashed line The rate parameterized as
1  zb ranges over b  14  25 depending on the geometry being smaller for models with
larger volume elements At the faintest magnitudes the model counts fall o with respect
to the data a feature more the result of a higher level of incompleteness than a lack of
volume at high redshift Incompleteness sets in because the higher mean redshifts generated
with this form of evolution results in a lower mean surface brightness at high redshift where
the rate of cosmological dimming 1  z4 is much greater than the compensation from
luminosity evolution Note that these rates of luminosity evolution are roughly consistent
albeit a little lower than the best t found by Lilly et al 1998 of 1  z27 for the spiral
galaxy population   1 0  z  1
For mass-conserving density evolution shown in Figure 3 as a solid line we require
a fairly high rate of density-evolution 1  zQ where Q  4  45 and a milder rate of
luminosity evolution 1  zb than above where b  02  12 in order to approximately
reproduce both the number counts and the angular sizes With the specied large merging
rate and a consequently larger number density at moderately high redshifts z  1 it
 7 
is trivial to reproduce the observed number of galaxies in the HDF Furthermore with
suitable adjustments of the relative amounts of luminosity and density evolution Qb it
is possible to simultaneously produce a rough t to the angular size distributions as well for
any choice of  Figure 4
32 Angular Sizes
We compare the distributions of half-light radii recovered from the HDF with those
of our simulations in Figure 4 Clearly at bright magnitudes 21  I814AB  226 the
angular sizes recovered from the simulations agree well with the observations as expected
given the selection of our input prototypes from this same magnitude range However at
fainter magnitudes the half-light radii from the no-evolution simulations hatched area
in Figure 4 indicating the 1  uncertainty based on the size of the bright sample are
signicantly larger than for the observations being somewhat reduced for the cases of lower
 see BBS-I Adding our ad-hoc dwarf population shown in Figure 4 as a dotted line
to the no-evolution results we still recover 36  12 45  13 and 81  22 times fewer
objects than we recover in the HDF for the size interval 015 arcsec  rhl  02 arcsec
and magnitude interval 24  I814AB  26 for   09  01   01 and   10
respectively
Incorporating our pure luminosity prescription shown in Figure 4 as a dashed line
only worsens the situation Not only are the recovered angular size distributions much
larger than those observed but also the number of large galaxies recovered is clearly in
excess of the data This signicant shift to larger sizes results from the general shift to
higher redshifts and hence lower surface brightness at xed magnitude where the 1  z4
cosmological dimming wins over the 1  z1425 surface brightness evolution required to
enhance the predicted counts
Therefore unless we have greatly erred in constraining the properties of the dwarf
population it seems clear that a large fraction of faint galaxies are intrinsically smaller
than our low-redshift input galaxy sample Accordingly it is not surprising that our
mass-conserving density evolution prescription is quite successful in allowing us to match
the observed sizes while at the same time allowing us to easily match the total number of
galaxies observed to a given magnitude limit Figure 3 For this two-parameter model the
range of Q and B which t both the counts and the sizes is moderately well-constrained
by the data The counts are most sensitive to B and the sizes to Q allowing us some
independence in deriving the rates

33 Completeness and Overcounting
Since we can easily match up our input generated catalogue with the recovered properties
of galaxies see BBS-I it is simple to determine quantities like the incompleteness Figure
5 shows that the incompleteness becomes signicant in the range I814AB  26 for
both our no-evolution simulations and those based on our simple luminosity evolution
prescriptions Incompleteness results from the fact that at increasingly faint magnitudes
detection requires smaller and hence intrinsically higher surface brightness galaxies at
xed magnitude Consequently the merger and dwarf models suer less incompleteness
at a given magnitude because of their inherently smaller sizes Of course evaluating the
incompleteness is ultimately model-dependent but the gentle rollover at faint magnitudes
occurs in a very similar way for our merger model as in the HDF consistent with our
nding above that the faint galaxies have small intrinsic angular sizes
In a similar manner we determine the rate at which we overcount the galaxy population
in our simulated elds since each image detected can be traced back to only one galaxy in
the input catalogue In Figure 6 we display the rate of overcounting for all the simulations
performed Evidently in our simulations overcounting is never an important eect The
worst case is for luminosity evolution especially the 1  z25 brightening rate used in
the   1 geometry With this form of evolution the redshift distribution extends to high
redshifts z  2  5 where the bright ultraviolet light of the HII regions clearly stands
Several prominent examples of these galaxies are evident in the simulated images see
Figure 1
34 Redshift Distributions
In Figure 7 we plot the predicted redshift distributions of the galaxies recovered by
matching up those objects recovered by SExtractor with our input catalogues Without
evolution very few galaxies lie beyond a redshift z  2 even at the faintest magnitudes
Similarly for our density-evolution models galaxies also have rather low redshifts a direct
consequence of the increasingly small sizes and luminosities of galaxies in this prescription
In contrast luminosity evolution accesses much higher redshifts as individual objects are
enhanced in luminosity
 9 
35 U300 and B450 Dropouts
As in BBS-I we can compare the number of high-redshift dropout galaxies recovered
from our simulations with those found in the HDF We present the Madau et al 1996
colour-colour criterion for the U300 and B450 dropouts in Figures 8-9 and tabulate the
number identied in Table 3
As in our no-evolution simulations see BBS-I our simple merging prescription
underpredicts the numbers of U300 and B450 band dropouts Of course with luminosity
evolution the numbers of dropouts are higher Clearly a more realistic inclusion of the star
formation activity in these models and the subsequent shift of the bolometric ux into the
ultraviolet would further serve to increase the number of high redshift objects in both the
pure luminosity and density evolution models Taking this into account we might expect
to nd an excess of dropouts in our luminosity evolution model similar to the ndings of
Ferguson  Babul 1998 and Pozzetti et al 1998 as well as a larger number of dropouts
in our density evolution model
4 Advanced Camera
We can use our simulations to predict the likely quality of even deeper images to be
obtained using the HST Advanced Camera Its Wide Field Camera WFC promises to
have a throughput which is  35 greater than the peak thoughtput of WFPC2 at  6500
A  5 greater in the B band  4500 A and  7 greater in the Z band  9000 A
Figure 2 shows a direct comparison of the image quality of WFPC2 HDF depth with that
obtainable with the AC simply using the improved response where our preferred   1
density evolution model is used for the simulation In addition to the nominal 0m7 to 1m1
improvement in depth due to the increased sensitivity the eld of view of the WFC will be
200 x 204 twice as large as WFPC2 with a pixel scale half as small so that by drizzling
not included here further improvements in resolution and therefore depth for the smallest
objects are expected
In addition since we are currently limited by the lack of good UV images the High
Resolution Camera HRC of the Advanced Camera though of more limited area coverage
26 x 29 will in principle provide a much large sample of UV-optical imaged galaxies
from which to expand an input prototype sample such as was used in the present work
The UV performace is 10 times higher than WFPC2 Ford et al 1997 at 2000A and
extends from 2000A to 10000A In light of this superior performance from the UV to the
optical the Advanced Camera should furthermore be quite powerful in identifying a large
 10 
drop-out population up to and through the V band
5 Discussion
Our most interesting nding here relates to the sizes of the faint images The sizes are
smaller in projected areas than our no-evolution extrapolation of the input bright galaxy
sample z  05 Adding in simple luminosity evolution only makes the situation worse
particularly for high  as sizes then eectively become larger than in the NE model This
together with the lack of bright blue ESO galaxies make it hard to accept the traditional
view that the observed evolution is merely dominated by the stellar evolution It is easier
to accommodate the size evolution and count excess by dropping the usual assumption of
space-density conservation and replacing it with the more general and physically motivated
idea that mass is conserved A realistic merger model involving star formation induced
during gas-rich mergers is needed to fully develop this approach For simplicity we have
chosen to present a cruder model that nevertheless reveals the general eect Here we
have traded image size for space density so that the product is independent of redshift
which for disk galaxies approximates mass conservation Although we underpredict the
fraction of dropouts a more realistic attempt to mock up this form of evolution would
include the enhancement in luminosity associated with the starburst phase which is well
documented from local examples of merging and interacting galaxies eg Joseph et al
1984 A self-consistent modication of this model can be imagined which might draw
on the observed evolution of the blue starburst population observed in the eld and its
continuation to high redshift found by Cowie et al 1996 and Steidel et al 1996
Contrary to our conclusion regarding the HDF Ferguson  Babul 1998 nd in their
modeling of luminosity evolution that the size distribution of the faint galaxy population
observed is consistent with a low  Universe Ferguson  Babul 1998 do not evolve the
physical sizes of their galaxies and base their input parameters on local galaxy observations
Whilst we are not completely sure of the source of this disagreement we suspect that
the surface brightnesses and normalizations they use for the lowest luminosity objects
may be too high relative to observations cf McGaugh  de Blok 1997 In any case
we are inclined to place greater weight on our nding because of our direct use of real
two-dimensional images for a complete sample of galaxies

6 Conclusions
Pure evolution in luminosity and hence in surface brightness can be made to match
the number-count excess for geometries with large volume elements ie   09  01
Unfortunately such models reveal a discrepancy in terms of the angular sizes of the faint
galaxy population Clearly galaxies would seem to evolve such that their sizes become
intrinsically smaller as well as more numerous Mass-conserving density evolution
merging can easily be made to achieve this goal but at the expense of lowering the mean
redshift and thereby underpredicting the observed dropout rate in the U300 and B450
bands This problem might be somewhat alleviated by accounting for the expected shift
in bolometric luminosity during the merger of gas rich systems Consequently it might
be worth pursuing in more detail the eect of starburst activity on the appearance and
pixel-by-pixel spectral energy distribution of the sample in question Dwarfs can also be
added but the low-redshift constraint on their frequency is such that they would have to
have an extremely steep slope or rapid evolution neither of which appear supported by
current observations

  01 and   1 geometries The luminosity evolution model produces a long tail to
high redshift whereas the no-evolution simulations and density-evolution simulations have
few galaxies above z  2 For comparison the upper panel shows the redshift estimates by
Lanzetta Yahil  Fernandez-Soto 1996 which are lower than the estimates by Mobasher
et al 1996 and higher than those of Sawicki Lin  Yee 1997

Fig 8 Comparison of the U300  B450AB versus B450  I814AB diagrams for our no-
evolution simulations lowest panel our luminosity evolution simulations second highest
panel and our density evolution simulations top panel with the observations for B450AB 
269 the same criterion used in Madau et al 1996 The area interior to the dashed line is the
region Madau et al 1996 suggests is occupied by high-redshift galaxies 2  z  35 whose
Lyman limit crosses the U300 passband Note that galaxies near the top of the colour-colour
diagram ie with U300  B450AB  46 are simply lower limits on the U300  B450AB
colour Both the no-evolution simulations and our merging prescriptions underpredict the
number of dropouts in this region though the luminosity evolution models seem to do much
better in matching these observations

with V606AB  280 the same criterion used in Madau et al 1996 With a dashed line we
have overplotted the B-band dropout region suggested by Madau et al 1996 for nding
high redshift 35  z  45 whose Lyman limit crosses the B bandpass Note that galaxies
near the top of the colour-colour diagram ie with B450  V606AB  35 are simply lower
limits on the B450  V606AB colour Similar conclusions hold as for the U300 dropouts
