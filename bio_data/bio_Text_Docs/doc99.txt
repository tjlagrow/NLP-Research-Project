Abstract
Changes in gene expression occurring during differentiation of  human monocytes into dendritic cells
were studied at the RNA and protein levels These studies showed the induction of several gene classes
corresponding to various biological functions These functions encompass of course antigen processing
and  presentation  cytoskeleton  cell  signalling  and  signal  transduction  but  also  an  increase  of
mitochondrial function and of the protein synthesis machinery including some but not all chaperones
These changes put in perspective the events occurring during this differentiation process On a more
technical point it  appears  that  the  studies  carried  out  at  the  RNA  and  protein  levels are  highly
complementary
Introduction
Dendritic cells DCs are essential in the development of the immune responses These cells reside in non
lymphoid tissues where they capture process and present antigens to circulating memory T cells Upon
danger signals DCs leave the non lymphoid tissues to reach lymphoid organs where they stimulate nave
T cells Dendritic cells can be differentiated in vitro from different precursors One type of  human DC
precursors is represented by blood CD34 progenitor cells These cells cultured in presence of GM-CSF
and TNF differentiate within two weeks in DCs  following two  pathways Indeed after  7  days  of
differentiation two populations of precursor cells either CD1a-  CD14  or  CD1aCD14- are observed
The CD1a population give rise to Langerhans cells the epidermal DCs characterized by the presence of
Birbeck granules while the CD14  generate DCs  devoid of  such  organelles These two types of  DC
populations are also functionally different since only the DCs derived from CD14  precursors  are
involved in the stimulation of  B  lymphocytes Due  to the relatively low numbers of  DCs  that can be
derived from CD34 cells the differentiation of DCs from blood monocytes represent  an  convenient
alternative Blood monocytes can be easily differentiated into DCs in presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 For
this reason most of the studies on DCs are performed using this type of DCs
In this latter system the differentiation into DC can be seen even at the morphological level While the
monocytes are rather round cells the dendritic cells as their name implies are covered of dendrites and
are therefore more amoebic in shape These dendrites are highly dynamic in nature so that the cell shape
varies Cella et al 1997
However little is known about the changes in gene expression occurring during this monocyte to DC
transition In order to understand the main features of this differentiation  two  approaches  can  be
developed One has been used by several laboratories and consists in the study of the modulation of the
amounts of different mRNA species during the differentiation This technique was proved to be powerful
in the characterization of new genes Another technique consist to  compare  the  levels of  proteins
expressed by DCs and monocyte precursors The present study was dedicated to the use of the proteomic
approach in the study of DCs and to compare the results with those obtained using the genetic analysis
of differentially expressed genes
Material and Methods
Cell differentiation
DCs were derived from elutriated human blood monocytes Monocytes were isolated by continuous flow
centrifugation leukapheresis and counterflow centrifugation elutriation Faradji et al 1994 and cultured
in RPMI 1640 medium containing Glutamax-I 10 heat inactivated FCS 1 sodium pyruvate and 50
Uml penicillin and streptomycin all from Life Technologies Paisley UK supplemented with 50 ngml
recombinant human GM-CSF and 40 ngml recombinant human  IL-4  PeproTech Rocky  Hill NJ
Differentiated DCs were used  at  day  7  and  the  differentiation of  monocytes was  checked by  flow
cytometric analysis of surface markers Saudrais et al 1998 The resulting population was devoid of
CD14 positive cells monocytes and contained over 80 CD11 MHC I and II   cells dendritic cells
markers The remaining lymphocytes and natural killer cells were removed by  magnetic beads coated
with anti CD3 lymphocytes and CD 16 NK antibodies
RNA preparation
Total RNA from DCs and monocytes 107 cells were isolated according to the method of Chomczynski
and Sacchi Chomczynski and Sacchi 1986 and mRNA were purified using oligo dT2 5 Dynabeads
Dynal Oslo Norway
cDNA differential gene bank
The DC cDNA library was made using the CapFinderTM PCR cDNA Library Construction Kit Clontech
Palo Alto CA USA The kit utilizes a CapSwitchTM oligonucleotide in the first-strand synthesis followed
by a long-distance LD PCR amplification to generate high yields of full-length double-stranded cDNA
The monocytes cDNA library was made using cDNA Synthesis Kit Boehringer Mannhein Germany
and further digested with Rsa I  for  ligation with biotinylated adaptors PCR  using  the corresponding
biotinylated primers were done to generate large amounts of this library
The differential DC gene bank  was obtained by repetitive cycles of denaturation at 90C for 5 min
hybridization overnight at 42C in an formamide containing buffer Tris-HCl pH 77 100 mM EDTA 2
mM  NaCl  500  mM  and  50  formamide  and  substraction  by  streptavidine phenol-chloroform
extraction using at each cycle ten time more cDNA from the monocyte biotinylated library than the initial
DC cDNA
Screening of the differential gene bank
The resulting DC differential gene bank was cloned in a derivative of  pCDM8  Invitrogen Groningen
The Netherlands Nucleotidic sequence of the clones was determined using the ABI PRISMR 377 DNA
Sequencer and analyzed using Blast search program at NCBI library
Total RNA from monocytes and DCs  was obtained with an RNeasy extraction kit Qiagen Les Ulis
France RNA was reverse transcribed with AMV reverse transcriptase Eurogentec Seraing Belgium
using random hexanucleotides Roche Diagnostics Meylan France as primers cDNAs were  then
amplified using different sets of specific oligonucleotides Eurogentec and different amounts of cDNA
reverse transcribed from 7 ng 20 ng or 100 ng total RNA Amplification was performed  in  an

Proteomics
Total protein extracts were prepared from 107  cells by  making first a concentrated cell suspension  in
isotonic Tris-EDTA-sucrose and diluting in a concentrated 125x lysis solution to end up in 7M urea
2M thiourea 4 CHAPS 20 mM spermine base and 40 mM DTT Rabilloud et al 1997 After clearing
by ultracentrifugation 200000 g 30 min the protein concentration of the extract was determined by  a
dye-binding assay 150 g of the extracts were applied  to  the  first  dimension gel  immobilized pH
gradient  pH  4  to  8   by  in-gel  rehydration  in  7M  urea  2M  thiourea 4  CHAPS  04  carrier
ampholytes 3-10 and 40 mM DTT Rabilloud et al 1997 Protein-loaded IPG strips were focused for
a total of 60000 Vh equilibrated 2x 10 min in Tris buffer containing urea and glycerol and supplemented
with 60 mM DTT first equilibration or 150 mM iodoacetamide second equilibration  Grg  et  al
1987 The second dimension was a 10 acrylamide gel After migration the gels were stained with silver
Rabilloud et al 1994 The gels were then analyzed with the Melanie software The induction factor is
defined as the ratio between the abundance of the spot in  ppm  of  the  total in  dendritic cells  over
monocytes The spots of interest ie induced more than 2-fold in 3  different experiments were then
excised and destained with ferricyanide-thiosulfate Gharahdaghi et al 1999  After  gel  washes  in
acetonitrile ammonium bicarbonate the proteins were digested in-gel with trypsin 18  h  The resulting
peptides were extracted with TFAacetonitrilewater and the peptide mixture was analyzed by  MALDI
TOF using sinapinic acid as a matrix on a Bruker Biflex instrument with delayed extraction Identification
of  the  proteins  using  these  mass  fingerprinting data  was  carried  out  using  the  Mascot  software
Alternatively the identification of Prx III was carried out by comigration of a total DC extract with semi
purified PrxIII from human placental mitochondria Rabilloud et al 1998
Results
General framework
In order to find differentiation markers for DCs a  differential RNA  approach was  first  undertaken
Numerous differentially-expressed clones were found and about 150 were analyzed These clones were
found to fall into 4 main classes as  shown in Table 1  Apart from miscellaneous  classes  such  as
nuclear proteins these classes corresponded to biological functions relevant either directly to the role of
DCs eg antigen  presentation or  more  indirectly to  functions  implied in  antigen processing  and
presentation eg vesicular transport and cytoskeleton The differential expression of  these RNAs  in
monocytes and monocyte-derived DCs was analyzed by RT-PCR and  typical results  are  shown  on
Figure 1 A relative quantification of the RT-PCR products was carried out by densitometry ans is shown
as relative abundance ratios DCmonocytes
To complement these data at  the  protein  level a  proteomics-based differential approach  was  also
undertaken on the same cells ie monocytes and DCs derived thereof Classical proteomics using high-
resolution two-dimensional electrophoresis as a protein display was used  Typical   2D  gel results are
shown on Figure 2 Differentially-expressed proteins at least two-fold are shown on  these  gels  by
arrows  These  proteins  were  then  identified  by  MALDI-TOF  mass  spectrometry leading  to  the
identifications shown on Figure 2 Here again the differentially-expressed proteins summarized in Table
2 pointed to several biological functions as discussed below
Antigen presentation genes are induced during dendritic cell differentiation
The expression of various genes implied or presumed to have a fonction in antigen presentation HLA-
DRa CD1E is clearly increased during DC differentiation These data are however obtained only at the
RNA level probably because of classical problems associated with the analysis of membrane proteins by
2D electrophoresis Wilkins et al 1998 However the RNA data are quite consistent with the antigen
presentation function of the DCs Among those genes CD1E has been studied in more detail Angnieux
et al 2000
Antigen processing machinery is induced during dendritic cell differentiation
In addition to antigen presentation per se the antigen processing machinery is also induced during DC
differentiation This can be detected either at the RNA level CD26  or  peptidyl dipeptidase and CD63
lysosomal protein or at the protein level grp78 and grp94 chaperones It must be noted that  these
chaperones are expressed mainly  in  the  ER  and  are  very likely to  contribute to  the  folding  of  the
numerous secreted and membrane proteins of the DCs including  of  course  the  antigen presentation
proteins
In addition to these proteins genes and proteins involved in antigen uptake  are  also  found  Adaptor
protein 2 beta involved in the formation of coated pits and annexin II involved in vesicular transport
belong to this class as well as the IgG receptor FcgRII CD32 and the b2 subunit of the complement
receptor CD11bCD18
Major cytoskeleton changes occur during dendritic cells differentiation
Changes in cytoskeleton-associated proteins were among the major changes detected either at the RNA or
protein levels These changes occurred either directly on  cytoskeletal proteins  eg vimentin or  on
proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodelling eg ARP 23 complex subunit gelsolin As DCs  draw
their name from the numerous membrane extensions they display on their surface it is not surprising that
the underlying cytoskeleton shaping these blobs is modified compared to the situation of the monocyte
precursor It must be noted that these changes in cytoskeleton-associated proteins can be found at both
the RNA and protein level increasing thereby the confidence in the reality of cytoskeleton remodelling in
Mitochondrion function is increased in dendritic cells differentiation
This is a more surprising result observed during DC differentiation Mitochondrion function increase is
supported mainly at the protein level EFTu MnSOD glutamate dehydrogenase The increase of EFTu
mitochondrial translation factor is probably indicative of an increase in the production of  the proteins
encoded by the mitochondrial genome As this genome only encodes respiratory complexes subunits and
mainly highly hydrophobic ones it can be inferred that the increase of EFTu indicates an increase in the
respiratory complexes and therefore in energy production This trend  is  further  confirmed  by  the
induction of Krebs cycle-related proteins eg glutamate dehydrogenase
The case of MnSOD appears somewhat more complicated This protein is involved in the destruction of
superoxide which is  produced by  the respiratory complexes during their functioning Thus MnSOD
overexpression can be seen as a further indirect evidence of respiratory  increase This  hypothesis  is
supported by the induction of PRX III which is  another mitochondrial protein playing a role in anti-
oxidative stress defense Araki et al 1999 However MnSOD increase is  also  observed during  the
response to pro-apoptotic signals Asoh et al 1989 and is thought to participate to the defense against
these signals Thus MnSOD overexpression can also be seen as a protection against the apoptotic signals
which occur during the life of the DCs
Cell communication and signalling
Several RNAs and proteins involved in these processes are also found induced in DCs Ionic regulators
calmodulin  as  well  as  extracellular  signalling  proteins  MCP4  or  proteins  involved in  signal
transduction GBI-2 are found in this class This variety indicates deep changes in the signalling activity
of DCs compared to their precursors a well-known phenomenon at the cytokines level Cella et al 1997
Other genes
Two other genes DRP-2 and cytochrome b561 have been found to be overexpressed at the mRNA level
in DCs compared to the monocyte precursors DRP-2  is  acting as  a signal transducer involved in the
development of nervous system Kitamura et al 1999 and cytochrom b561 Srivastava 1995 as a pure
electron channel playing a role in the biosynthesis of  peptide neurotransmitters Since a bi-directional
communication between the epidermal DCs Langerhans cells and nerves has been described Torii et al
1997 1998 these two proteins could be involved in the communication between immunological and
neurologic system
A transporter of the Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein MRP  family named MRP-4 was also
shown to be mainly overexpress at the mRNA level in DCs compared to monocytes A contribution of
MRP-4 to the physiology and function of DCs can be hypothetised since MDR1 an other member of the
family has been involved in the migration capacity of  DCs  Randolph  et  al  1998  An  interresting
property of MRP4 is to extrude nucleoside analogues The cell line CEM-R1 which over-express MRP4
can support the grow of HIV even in presence of nucleoside based anti-HIV drugs Schuetz et al 1999
Whether the expression of MRP4 in DCs contributes to the keeping of a HIV reservoir is  provocative
and should be investigated
Discussion
In order to study the genes which expression is increased during differentiation of monocytes into DCs
two differential approaches were carried out  at the mRNA and protein  level These  two  approaches
proved complementary and  pointed    mainly  to  the  same  biological functions  However it  seems
interesting to underline that there was no intersection between the genes evidenced by the two approaches
In other words none of the induced genes was found both at the RNA and protein level and we would
like to try to find out the reasons for this kind of discrepancy
Why does proteomics miss the genes detected by differential RNA analysis 
Theoretically proteomics should be the ultimate tool to detect variations in gene expression as it analyzes
the end product of gene expression ie proteins However careful analysis of  the possibilities of  the
technique points out to important limitations which are evidenced by this work
The first limitation lies in the analysis window displayed by the proteomics experiments which we have
carried out For example the pH window in the first dimension is 4 to 8 Therefore basic proteins eg
calmodulin MCP4 which mRNAs are found induced are completely missed by the proteomics analysis
The second important limitation is in the type of proteins which can be analyzed by proteomics It is now
well evidenced that proteomics performs poorly in the analysis of membrane proteins Adessi et al 1997
Wilkins et al 1998 Thus it is not surprising that induction of membrane  proteins  eg HLA-DR
CD1E CD18 CD32 and CD63 cytochrome b561 can be seen at the RNA level but not at the protein
level The same trend of poor visualization also applies to high molecular weight proteins AP2 CREB
binding protein
The third and important limitation lies in the visualization of low abundance proteins Wilkins  et  al
1998 When total cell extracts are analyzed the minimal abundance of proteins which can be detected in
silver-stained gels with reasonable crowding is 104  protein molecules per cell by  comparison actin is
present at ca108 molecules per cell This figure represents an  absolute detection minimum Correct
quantitative analysis requires to be at least 3 fold over this  minimum This  implies in  turn  that  low
abundance proteins such as transcription factors or proteins involved in signal transduction are below the
analysis threshold of the technique
These technical limitations point out to the weaknesses of proteomics However it must be pointed out
that many of these limitations can now be tried to be overcome both for basic proteins Grg et al 1998
for membrane proteins Santoni et al 2000 and to a lesser extent for  low abundance proteins by  the
analysis of cell fractions enriched in the proteins of interest  eg nuclei membrane preparations and not
of total cell extracts Such work however needs the use of non-standard techniques or  reagents and is
therefore much more difficult to carry out
Why does differential RNA analysis miss the genes detected by proteomics  
From the previous paragraphs it  appears  that  differential RNA  analysis  does  not  show  any  of  the
limitations shown by proteomics Thus the induced proteins evidenced by  proteomics should also be
found induced at the RNA level which is obviously not the case from our results In order to get more
insights into this phenomenon we performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis on some RNAs which
proteins were found induced by proteomics The results are shown on Figure 3 and exemplify several
situations In some cases such as GP96 grp94 an induction can be seen at the RNA level but it can be
noticed that the basal level in monocytes is much higher than what is generally observed with the genes
detected as differentially expressed directly at the RNA level compare with Figure 1 In other case such
as MnSOD no induction can be seen at the RNA level while a major induction is  seen at the protein
level In other cases EF-Tu GBI-2 the RT-PCR results are difficult to interpret and a weak  induction
can be detecteed at the RNA level
Our explanation for  this situation is  the importance of  translational and post-translational controls as
previously evidenced from the correlation analysis between RNA and proteins Anderson and Seilhamer
1997 Gygi et al 1999 A good example is the case of mitochondrial proteins Anderson and Seilhamer
1997 Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins show a very bad correlation between RNA and protein
levels as exemplified in the liver for carbamoyl phosphate synthase Anderson and Seilhamer 1997 This
has  been  attributed  to  the  fact  that  mature  mitochondrial  proteins  are  protected  from  proteolytic
degradation by their localization and are therefore more readily accumulated at the protein level from
rather low mRNA levels Thus during long processes such as  the differentiation process studied here
large increase in the concentration of mitochondrial proteins can occur from marginal increase in the
corresponding mRNA levels It is therefore not surprising that we find again a poor correlation between
RNA and protein increases for  the mitochondrial proteins we have identified such  as  EF-Tu or  even
worse MnSOD In the latter case there is a strong induction at the protein level while the RNA level
decreases
The case of vimentin is also typical of translational control In the case of  stimulation of fibroblasts by
serum it has been shown that although vimentin mRNA is  present at high levels in quiescent cells it
remains weakly translated while it is highly translated in growing cells Thomas and Thomas 1986 The
same situation probably also applies in our differentiation system for vimentin and the other cytoskeleton-
associated proteins detected by proteomics
These data clearly show that important protein variation can occur even with modest mRNA variations
and therefore that differential RNA display misses some important variations It would be very interesting
to check whether large variations in mRNA levels always lead to large variations in protein amounts or if
translational control can completely dampen the variations observed at the RNA level leading to false
positive obtained by RNA analysis Unfortunately this will be very difficult to find out in our system as
most if not all of the genes found induced at the RNA level will not show their protein products in our
2D gels
It must ne noted that   in some examples  ARP23 Grp94  there  is  a  good  correlation between the
variations observed at the RNA and protein levels However even in those cases the variation in RNA
levels is rather weak and is not easily detected by differential display analysis It is very likely that other
techniques such as SAGE or array hybridization will be more suited to this type of analysis However
the strong decorrelation observed for some classes of proteins eg mitochondrial proteins is completely
independent from the measurement methods is a real biological fact
What is the relevance of induced genes and proteins found to the biological process 
Taken together the RNA and protein data point out to several classes of induced genes They  represent
various biological functions which are obviously induced during DC differentiation from monocytes The
increase in proteins involved in antigen processing and presentation is almost trivial in regard to HLA-DR
owing to the role of DCs as professional antigen-presenting cells In contrast CD1e which at the first
glance belongs to the family of the CD1 antigen presenting molecules was found to be quite different of
other  CD1  molecules  in  terms  of  biochemical properties  and  cellular location  Angnieux  et  al
suggesting a new function in CDs Among the other classes  the  changes  in  cytoskeleton-associated
proteins  is  also  rather  obvious  due  to  the  strong  morphological  changes  occurring  during  DC
differentiation However the increase in metabolism mitochondrial function is more unexpected Owing
to the relevance of the other classes and to the self-consistency of the changes observed in our study it is
very likely that the changes observed point to a true increase of metabolism which remain however to be
explained The hypothesis we would like to put forward for  this metabolism increase is  related to the
major changes in cellular shape and intracellular trafficking occurring in DCs as compared to monocytes
The constant cytoskeleton remodelling occurring in DCs by their dendrites is  probably highly energy-
consuming  as  is  the  intense  intracellular trafficking  related  to  massive  antigen  processing  and
presentation These phenomena could explain why  the  mitochondrial energy  production  system  is
induced in DCs with a correlative induction of mitochondrial anti-oxidant proteins MnSOD  and PRX
III It is well known that the respiratory chain is a major producer of reactive oxygen species Raha and
Robinson 2000 so that an increase in respiration also results in an increase in reactive oxygen species
production The latter phenomena is counteracted by the increase in antioxidant proteins observed in
In conclusion it appears that these differential analyses made at both the RNA and protein level are highly
complementary in their results and offer indeed good cross-validation This cross-validation leads to good
confidence in the results which seem also quite relevant to the biological question under study and give
new insights to the biochemical phenomena occurring during differentiation of monocytes into DCs
