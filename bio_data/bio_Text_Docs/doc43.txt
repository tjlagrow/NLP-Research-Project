The letter resolves the long standing debate as to the proper time scale    of the onset of the
immunological synapse IS bond the non-covalent chemical bond dening the immune pathways
involving T-cells and antigen presenting cells APC Results from our model calculations show
   to be of the order of seconds instead of minutes Close to the linearly stable regime we show
that in between the two critical spatial thresholds dened by the integrinligand pair 2  40-45
nm and the T cell receptor TCRpMHC bond 1  14-15 nm    grows monotonically
with increasing co-receptor bond length separation   2  1  26-30 nm while    decays
with 1 for xed 2 The non-universal -dependent power-law structure of the probability density
function PDF further explains why only the TCRpMHC bond is a likely candidate to form a
stable synapse

INTRODUCTION
Cell to cell contacts dene key chemical pathways
that articulate immune response signaling through cel-
lular signal transduction 1 Signals are transported in
the event of attached integrin-ligand pairs whereupon
they are carried through intracellular signaling pathways
Such bio-mechanical signaling mediated by surrounding
coreceptor molecules CD4 CD8 CD45 proliferates an
immune response in the body through cellular level in-
teractions 2 often resulting in the formation of the im-
munological synapse IS bond between the immune cells
T  B cells and the antigen presenting cells APC In
T-cells some of these signaling pathways are directed to-
ward the nucleus where conformal changes lead to cell
proliferation and triggering of the immune eector func-
The T-cellAPC bond a close contact patch be-
tween the membranes is known to have a diameter 10
m and contains a large number of membrane bound
molecules 3 Important cell surface molecules on the T-
cell include the T-cell receptor TCR and the leukocyte
function associated-1 adhesion molecule LFA-1 The
T-cell receptor TCR binds with peptide bound major
histocompatibility complexes pMHC on the APC Sim-
ilarly the integrin LFA-1 molecule has a natural ligand
in the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ICAM-1 on the
APC surface
Nascent TCRpMHC and LFA-1ICAM-1 bonds begin
to form following the initial cellular attachment Flu-
orescent tagging reveals heterogeneous segregation and
aggregation of the surface molecules throughout the in-
terface 3 4 a result that is attributed to the presence
of multiple length scales 14-15 nm for TCRpMHC
and 40-45 nm for LFA-1ICAM-1 5 6 leading to the
dynamic reorganization of the cell surface molecules as
a pathway towards IS formation 79
Initially the
longer bonds LFA-1ICAM-1 localize at the centre of
the contact zone with small patches of shorter bonds
TCRpMHC toward the edge of the contact zone Such
nonlinear patterning have been studied in details 12 13
with theoretical models convincingly proving that the dy-
namical reorganization is the result of the presence of
multiple length scales in the problem along with descrip-
tions of conditions in which such changes in receptor con-
gurations 3 occur
In what follows we will use this
fact as an input but otherwise focus on a dierent aspect
of quantifying the strength of the immunological synapse
bond that was beyond the scope of either of these papers
From the binding assay measurements we know that
the anity of the TCR-pMHC complex may vary dras-
tically depending on the proliferated peptide TCR se-
quences and the MHC allele What triggers the se-
quential patterning process leading primarily to the
aggregation-segregation mechanism followed by binding
of the IS bond are dened by the binding energies of
the respective of the emergent synapse While such a
binding anity is not exactly proportional to the sep-
aration length of the individual cell membranes it has
now been proved 14 that the TCRpMHC interaction
has to be long enough to complete proximal signalling
while the dissociation rates have to be suciently short
to allow multiple TCRs engaging with the same pMHC
As explained in 14 following an initial clustering of the
TCRs on the cell surface anity rates are aected by
the average dwell times with anity increasing mono-
tonically as dwell times up to a threshold followed by a
saturation regime so while it would be ideal to model
the TCRpMHC interaction with anity as the switch
dening the average dwell time as our regulation order
parameter allows for more direct theoretical modelling
of the IS dynamics and in turn the patterning process At
this minimalist level we are considering only one-no-one
TCR-pMHC interactions which is why TCR intensity re-
sulting from the aggregation on the cell membranes will
only linearly aect the IS kinetics
The early patterning signals cause polarization of the
microtubule organizing centre eectively stopping T-cell
migration and orienting the internal machinery toward
the contact area At a time scale of up to 5 minutes the
pattern inverts such that the TCRpMHC bonds migrate
to the centre of the initial close contact patch and the
LFA-1ICAM-1 bonds form a tight adhesion ring around
the periphery 3 Such a pattern inversion is strictly a
non-universal feature since dynamic interactions ki-
napses between the cells are also shown to initiate im-
mune eector functions 10 11
It has been largely recognized that the mature synapse
is required to trigger the immune eector function 9 A
primary objective of this study is to focus on the kinetic
behavior at the start of this dynamical bond formation
process When the TCR is attached to an agonist pMHC
intracellular signaling molecules can phosphorylate the
cytoplasmic portion of the TCR and signal transduction
occurs However it is not well understood if signaling
continues after the TCR has disengaged from the pMHC
although some studies indicate this may be possible 7
Recent studies have also identied TCR microclusters
small patches of membrane enriched in TCR and signal-
ing molecules continuously forming at the periphery of
the synapse throughout the contact duration15 Signal-
ing from these microclusters peaks while in the periphery
and diminishes as they migrate toward the centre of the
synapse The time dynamics of these signals are in the
order of seconds consistent with upregulation of Ca2
levels before the synapse matures minutes later 10
The strength and start time of the IS bond patterning
is dened by the average time the two randomly forced
due to thermal uctuations uctuating membranes T
cell  APC remain in contact with each other above a
minimum threshold  that is dened by the bond lengths
of the participating molecules a model that was suc-
cessfully implemented previously 16 in estimating the
average lengths scale of the interacting T CellpMHC
patch sizes In line with the Chattopadhyay-Burroughs
model 16 here we analyze the average time of contact
of these close contact patches at the start of pattern-
ing based on an analogous one membrane-two threshold
model theoretical architecture follows 16 This is a
linearized around the linearly stable xed point version
of the nonlinear reaction-diusion model due to Qi et
al 12 13 18 19 in line with our previous work in this
sequel 16 Numerical analysis of the nonlinear models
12 18 have been shown to be in near quantitative agree-
ment with the early images of the synapse3 4 Our lin-
earized model portrays the non-stationary state dynam-
ics of a uctuating membrane x t close to the linearly
stable point and across a range of mean separation dis-
tances dened by the bond lengths of relevant corecep-
tor molecules 15-45nm As shown in 12 17 incorpo-
ration of the rst nonlinear cubic perturbation in the
linearized stochastic model predicts a Hopf-bifurcation
point below which the linear regime dominates and above
which nonlinear patterning 18 takes over Our focus
here is to study the crossover from the linear to the non-
linear regime
II THE TCRAPC MEMBRANE
FLUCTUATION MODEL
The dynamics that we are studying here stems from
the interaction of two stochastically driven membranes
With a membrane separation distance designated by x
where x is any point on the membrane observed at time t
our linearized stochastic continuum model can be written
M   B4  2    x t
Here B is the coecient of the membrane rigidity  is
the surface tension  quanties the linearized relaxation
kinetics close to equilibrium and M is the membrane
damping constant As in a standard membrane dynam-
ics the membrane rigidity term and the surface relax-
ation terms create a force balance by working against
each other while the contribution from the surrounding
coreceptor molecules is encapsulated in the linear 
term The thermal noise x t is assumed to be a
spatio-temporally independent Gaussian white noise de-
ned through uctuation-dissipation kinetics 16

Although broadly argued from a thermodynamic per-
spective the above stochastic model has its origin in a
more detailed nonlinear dynamical system architecture as
propounded in 12 13 The linearized model focuses on
the contact events TCRAPC synapse and arises from
a linear stability analysis of the nonlinear model dened
in these references close to the equilibrium point De-
tailed descriptions of the linear stability criteria and its
application are available in 13 and have been previously
employed in 16 It must be mentioned that the range of
validity of this linear model is limited to the start of the
immunological synapse patterning and can not account
for the eventual self-organised criticality leading to the
mature synapse formation
A The two threshold model
Our starting model
is a generalized version of the
model described in 16 In this earlier work we dened
a one membrane model uctuating across a threshold
as an analogue of our physical system
In that model
this single threshold cloned the TCRAPC and other
small coreceptor bond length range but considered all
larger length bonds eg integrin-ligand as a constant
This present improved model considers two thresholds
1 TCRpMHC and 2 integrinligand in acknowl-
edgment of the presence of two dierent length scales
one large and other small in a reminder of 18 Two
opposing points on the membranes are said to be within
close contact if the separation distance is less than i
lower threshold t11 b the uctuation enters the  region
from below the lower threshold persists and becomes
larger than the upper threshold t12 c the uctuation
enters the  region from above the upper threshold per-
sists and exits below the lower threshold t21 and nally
d the uctuation enters from above the upper thresh-
old persists and exits above the upper threshold t22 A

tence considering all four scenarios together can then be

III ANALYSIS
The theoretical routine focuses both on the analyti-
cal as well as on the numerical aspects For the former
the target is to recast the model solutions within a Gaus-
sian tuitionary Process GSP framework For the latter
Euler-integration of the stochastic model is followed by
the estimation of the probably density function of the
persistent crossings The following sub-sections detail
these separately

IV RESULTS
Figure 2 shows the ensemble average for the time per-
sistence above any of the 1 or 2 thresholds keeping
the other xed for both the numerical and the scaled an-
alytical solution The parameters used give rise to per-
sistent close contact patches in the order of magnitude
required for the biological problem that is 10-50 nm
The numerical results in dots gure 2 are consistent
with the analytical solutions continuous line gure 2
where the close contact time decreases as the separa-
tion distance increases suggesting that the TCRpMHC
bond persists longer than the LFA-1ICAM-1
The result shown in gure 2 can be qualitatively un-
derstood from simple probabilistic considerations As
the threshold value increases it becomes more dicult
for the randomized Gaussian uctuations to cross this
threshold resulting in reduced average time spent above
the threshold value More non-trivial though is the
functional nature of the decay in the     value

sual impression the decay prole here is not exponential

of the starting model equation

A vital part of this model study is the analysis of the
dynamics of the randomly driven membrane in between
the two given thresholds In line with the parlance used
previously as well as in 16 this can be represented by an
estimation of the time persistence between two threshold
values 1 and 2 where 1 is the T cell analogue of the
TCRpMHC bond length  15 nm while 2 symbolizes
the ICAM-1LFA-1 bond separation length  45 nm

the two thresholds as a function of the distance  between

the distance between the thresholds is given by 
As previously the dotted points refer to the numeri-
cal simulation results while the continuous line represents
the interpolation of the same to maintain continuity The
time persistence initially increases as  increases then it
saturates and asymptotically approaches the    1
value As   0 the average time persistence tends to-
ward the smallest time length scale used for our case
dt  01 Once again a quantitative understanding of
gure 3 can be had from the fact that an increase in
the  value can be wrought about in either of the two
possible ways - an increase in 2 for xed 1 or else a
decrease in 1 for a xed 2 For the rst case when 2
increases at a xed 1 it is easier for a uctuation mode
to remain within the upper limit 2 than to cross it
while for the second case with a xed value of the upper
threshold 2 a lowering of 1 increases the probability
of a uctuation mode crossing this line resulting in an
increased value of   
Figures 2 and 3 respectively express the variation of the
average persistent times against bond lengths above
a critical threshold and that in between two thresholds
1 and 2 These results are subsets of a bigger en-
semble dened by a membrane that uctuates across two
thresholds 1 and 2 or else that of two membranes
whose uctuations are measured across a single thresh-
old  that as already explained earlier are equiva-
lent analytical descriptions
In line with our model of
a single membrane uctuating across two threshold de-
tailed in the previous section and as depicted in g-
ure 1 the statistics can be classied in to four broad

plotted for three values of 
As  increases the probability density for the 12 case
shows an increase in the probability for longer time per-
sistence a result that matches with the observation pre-
sented earlier through gure 3 On the other hand the
number of 12 events become less frequent as  is in-
creased The 11 densities also change slightly again
showing an increase in the probability for longer time
persistence
V CONCLUSIONS
The analysis presented here has two major immuno-
logical implications Firstly gures 2 and 3 clearly prove
that the onset of patterning at the immature kinapse
level when the central LFA-1ICAM-1 bond gives way to
the smaller TCRpMHC bond occurs at the time scale of
seconds This discovery is expected to conrm the start

of the system parameters along with being functions of 
gure 3 and 12 gure 5 conrms a widely acknowl-
edged belief in the community that the TCRpMHC bond
is non-self-organizing in nature and hence is the only sta-
ble bond at this spatio-temporal regime An immediate
impact of this can be seen in the projected time scale for
the crossover from the linear to the nonlinear phase that
as is shown in Fig 3 spans 2-4 seconds peak time of the
PDF prole The implication of this analysis is that of
a time scale dierence of an order of magnitude related
to the start time of the immature IS bond formation
a time scale that is also associated with the transition
from the linear to the nonlinear regime and hence our
emphasis on a study of the linear stability regime of an
otherwise nonlinear dynamics As to how such crossover
is aected by kinase-phosphatase pathways these path-
ways act as signal transduction inhibitors and thereby
control the rate of the IS bond formation and what mod-
ication this may bring about in the prediction of the
time scale of a mature IS bond are some of the exciting
topics that we are presently working on New results are
shortly to be communicated on the quantitative nature
of the extremal value statistics of these uctuations and
how such non-universal exponents aect the life time and
strength of IS bonds
