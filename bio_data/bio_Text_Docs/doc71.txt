Abstract
A problem of substantial interest is to systematically map variation in chromatin structure
to gene expression regulation across conditions environments or dierentiated cell types We
developed and applied a quantitative framework for determining the existence strength and
type of relationship between high-resolution chromatin structure in terms of DNaseI hypersen-
sitivity DHS and genome-wide gene expression levels in 20 diverse human cell lines We show
that 25 of genes show cell-type specic expression explained by alterations in chromatin
structure We nd that distal regions of chromatin structure eg 200kb capture more genes
with this relationship than local regions eg 25kb yet the local regions show a more pro-
nounced eect By exploiting variation across cell-types we were capable of pinpointing the
most likely hypersensitive sites related to cell-type specic expression which we show have a
range of contextual usages This quantitative framework is likely applicable to other settings
aimed at relating continuous genomic measurements to gene expression variation

Introduction
Humans like all other multicellular organisms possess a large number of distinct cell-types each
of which is specialized for a particular function within the body Cells from a variety of tissue types
exhibit dierent gene expression proles relating to their function where typically only a fraction
of the genome is expressed As all somatic cells share the same genome specialization is in part
achieved by physically sequestering regions containing non-essential genes into heterochromatin
structures Genes which are needed for the particular task of the cell-type display an accessi-
ble chromatin structure allowing for the binding of transcription factors and other related DNA
machinery and subsequent gene expression
To date most studies have been limited to considering the chromatin accessibility surrounding
the promoter region of genes which is typically proximal 10kb to the transcription region in
just one or very few cell-types or experimental conditions 53 4 43  However it is also of interest
to understand how larger regions cid2910kb of chromatin structure relate to a genes expression
variation across multiple cell types disease states or environmental conditions Recently several
large-scale international collaborations have started to generate data that can be used for this
purpose 38 although doing so requires new developments in computational methods 21 22 11
To this end we undertook a genome-wide investigation to characterize the relationship between
variations in chromatin structure and gene expression levels across 20 diverse human cell lines SI
Table S1 We utilized data on chromatin structure as ascertained through DNaseI hypersensitivity
DHS measured by next-generation deep sequencing technology and gene expression data mea-
sured by Aymetrix exon arrays Replicated data on 10 cell lines were also utilized to assess the
robustness of our method
Relating DHS to gene expression levels across multiple cell-types is challenging because the
DHS represents a continuous variable along the genome not bound to any specic region and the
relationship between DHS and gene expression is largely uncharacterized In order to exploit varia-
tion across cell-types and test for cell-type specic relationships between DHS and gene expression
the measurement units must be placed on a common scale the continuous DHS measure associated
to each gene in a well-dened manner and all measurements considered simultaneously Moreover
the chromatin and gene expression relationship may only manifest in a single cell-type making
standard measures of correlation between the two uninformative because their relationship is not
linear over a continuous range as shown in Fig 1 further details in SI and Figs S2-S6
The computational approach developed here provides a powerful tractable and intuitive way
of representing these data and capturing biologically informative relationships We were able to
characterize the level to which variation of chromatin accessibility is associated with gene expression
variation in a cell-type specic manner Within genomic segments of signicant chromatin gene
expression concordance our methodology is further capable of pinpointing the most likely local sites
related to the detected association We show that such sites are context specic and can be shared
across genes within a single cell-type or across several cell-types Our quantitative framework has
some generality in that it may be readily applied to associate any quantitative measure along the
genome to gene expression variation
Figure 1 Overview of Data and Proposed Approach A Gene expression measurements for twenty cell lines on an
example gene HNF4A B DNase-I Hypersensitivity DHS fragment sequencing counts in a region about the gene C The
DHS signal is captured by summing the overall number of fragments over a given segment size eg  100kb about the genes
transcriptional start sight TSS to obtain a DHS volume After global normalization the gene expression data and DHS
volume measures are scaled to lie on the unit interval 01 and the data are centered about the origin according to the two-
dimensional medoid For the HNF4A example three outliers are clearly visible for example HepG2 displays both chromatin
accessibility and active gene expression whereas Hela displays only chromatin accessibilty The goal is to quantitatively capture
the isolated relationship seen in HepG2 and assess whether this relationship is statistically signicant Traditional measures of
linear correlation are not suitable for identifying this type of signal as shown by the substantial change seen after removal of
a single cell line Hela even though the data for Hela are expected to exist for many genes and cell lines The proposed ARS
is robust to Hela since the measure is based on angular placement and the median distance to the medoid of the data dashed
circle D The ARS statistic is calculating by rst quantifying the relative distance to the origin for each cell line in a robust
manner An angular penalty for each cell line is then calculated to quantify cell-types concordant in both expression and DHS
measured This quantity is measured in terms of angular distance from the 45 degree line and it is then multiplied times its
respective relative distance to give and overall score for each cell line The maximum score is taken as the statistic for the given
gene allowing a comparison across all genes E A local version of the ARS statistic we introduce can pinpoint DHS peaks
contributing the most to the detected association See main text for details on the proposed methods

21 Genome-wide proling of chromatin accessibility and gene expression
We utilized data on genome-wide high-resolution chromatin accessibility measurements for 20
distinct human primary and culture cell lines that were obtained by an established sequencing-based
method 34 In principle accessible open chromatin is cleaved by the non-specic endonuclease
DNaseI and the cleaved fragments are sequenced to provide a high-resolution genome-wide map of
DNaseI hypersensitivity DHS for every cell-type SI Table S2 The interpretation of these data is
that increased fragment counts within a region are indicative of greater chromatin accessibility To
investigate the impact of regional chromatin accessibility on gene expression variation we likewise
utilized genome-wide gene expression measurements in each cell line from Aymetrix exon arrays
SI Table S4 A total of 19215 genes were analyzed after preprocessing Methods
With these quantications we sought to characterize the relationship between chromatin ac-
cessibility and gene expression in a cell-type specic manner summarized in Fig 1 To this end
the cell-type specic chromatin proles were quantied by integrating the DHS fragment counts
over increasingly larger genomic segments relative to the gene of interest SI Fig S7 to obtain
a cell-type specic regional DHS volume We selected a range of segments that were likely to
encompass all proximal TSS 25kb and most distal regulatory elements TSS 50kb 100kb
150kb 200kb 100kb minus proximal 25kb and 200kb minus proximal 25kb Addition-
ally to account for copy number variation and chromosome arm related eects the obtained DHS
volumes were scaled on either side of the centromere to arrive at equilibrium across samples SI
Fig S8 Alternative representations of DHS signal 11 6 could be utilized at this step although
we did not identify any advantages in doing so Gene expression values were summarized as the
mean intensity across all probe-sets linked to a given RefSeq-gene
22 Detecting cell-type specic chromatin accessibility and gene expression con-
cordance
Due to the on-o nature of DHS and subsequent transcription there will not necessarily be a
linear relationship between DHS and gene expression measures Using correlation or correlation-
like statistics to associate the two measurements across all cell-types proved to be unreliable and
uninformative further details in SI and Figs S2-S6 One of the key types of relationships we
sought to detect is of the type shown in Fig 1 where one or very few cell types are outliers from
the others The standard Pearson correlation statistic is not well-suited for this scenario First
it requires the data to be jointly Normal in order to obtain parametric p-values but the Normal
assumption does not hold for these data SI Fig S3 Second this correlation statistic is unstable
when there are outliers even when using permutation based p-values demonstrated directly on
these data SI Figs S2 and S4 The rank-based Spearman correlation statistic is a potential
alternative but it shows very poor power relative to the method proposed here as shown in Fig 2
See also SI Figs S5 and S6 For example at a false discovery rate FDR  005 the proposed
method identies 2538 genes with a cell-type specic DHS and gene expression relationship whereas
the Spearman statistic identies only 286 Figs 2 S5 and S6
The new statistic proposed here is designed to be appropriate for scenarios when both mea-
surements are restricted to a narrow relative range with one or very few cell-types appearing as
distinct outliers To evaluate the relationship between the DHS volume of a genomic segment and
gene expression we took into account the compactness of the measurements versus any distinct
outliers in both dimensions and whether the outliers were concordant in both measurements ie
a simultaneous increase or decrease to form an overall composite measure called an Angle Ratio
Statistic ARS detailed in Fig 1 Fig S1 Methods and SI To summarize we rst scale and
median center the DHS volume and expression data respectively for a given gene We then calcu-
late the relative distance of each cell type to the overall center of the data which serves as a way
to measure the degree to which each cell type is an outlier In order to measure concordance of
DHS volume and gene expression we calculate the angular distance between each point and the 45
line of identity penalizing points further away from the line of identity according to a data-derived
exponential function These two quantities are then multiplied to form an ARSi value for each
cell type i  1 2     20 and the maximal value ARSmax is the overall statistic that quanties
cell-type specic DHS volume and gene expression concordance for a given gene
To identify statistically signicant genes from ARSmax we constructed a null distribution based
on randomization of the observed experimental data see Methods SI and Fig S9 ARSmax values
obtained from the randomized data were used as a basis for determining a p-value of the observed
ARSmax for each gene False-discovery rate FDR based statistical signicance and the proportion
of genes with a true chromatin accessibility and gene expression relationship were estimated from
the p-values 45 Figure 2b
We estimate that 25 of genes show concordance between chromatin accessibility and gene ex-
pression variation in a cell-type specic manner While our strategy is capable of detecting outliers
showing negative concordance decreased chromatin accessibility and decreased gene expression
none were found to be signicant at FDR  005 The number of signicant genes increased by
inclusion of distal DHS volume Fig 2b column 2 indicating that distal chromatin programming
eects are more widespread in a genome-wide sense On the other hand using the proximal DHS
volume we observe a greater empirical eect size compared to the distal DHS volumes Fig 2b
columns 3-5
This observation is explained by the aggregation of genes signicant for the same cell-type
along the genome 44 Testing whether one or more signicant genes within a 100kb region were
associated with the same cell-type we found that 481 out of 668 signicant genes within the specied
boundary stem from the same cell-type Fishers exact test p-value  22e-16 SI and Fig S15 It
is however important to note that inclusion of increasingly distal regions also increases the noise in
the DHS volume wherefore the eect size and ultimately the number of true associations starts to
decline Fig 2a
23 Experimental replication
To assess reproducibility we tested the concordance of signicant results among replicated data for
10 cell-types Based on two independent measurements of DHS and gene expression respectively
we calculated the fraction of predictions preserved in all four-way comparisons SI We found that
between 86 to 91 of signicant genes FDR  005 were identical SI Fig S16
24 Gene ontology and pathway analysis
To determine the biological coherence of the set of genes found to be signicant for each cell-type
we performed a gene ontology GO enrichment analysis 10 The method computes enrichment
within the process and function components of GO categories and assigns a numerical signicance
Figure 2 Statistical signicance for ARS and correlation across genomic segments A Depicts the number of
signicant genes found at increasingly larger genomic segments for ARS and Spearman correlation respectively solid line is
ARS and dashed line is Spearman correlation B Statistical signicance according to DHS volume segment size Column 2
shows the percentage of genes estimated to have concordant DHS volume and gene expression variation as captured by ARSmax
1 0 as estimated in 45 Columns 3-5 show the number of statistically signicant genes at various FDR cut-os While the
25Kb window shows more signicant genes at the stringent FDR cut-os indicating a larger eect size the overall percentage
of genes showing a relationship is notably lower than the more distal DHS volumes Compared to Spearman correlation ARS is
more powerful at detecting these associations see SI for further details C The relative ARSi values across all cell-types for
signicant genes in the 100kb region versus the analogous components for Spearman correlation the cross product terms that
sum to form the overall correlation The ARSi values distinguish cell lines that have a strong DHS and expression concordance
substantially more clearly than the Spearman correlation showing that the traditional correlation is more likely to generate
spurious results from small changes to the data Enrichment of biological functions for the signicant genes found by either
method corroborates this nding see SI Fig S14

httpencodeprincetonedu for results on all DHS segment sizes For example human T-
cells showed a strong enrichment of T-cell receptor related genes whereas hepatic cells showed
enrichment of lipid metabolism related genes KEGG pathways 24 7 were likewise enriched in
a cell-type specic manner For example HepG2 showed signicant enrichment for genes within
the bile acid synthesis and drug metabolism while HL60 showed signicant enrichment within the
hematopoietic cell lineage data not shown
Furthermore all genes detected within each cell type at FDR  005  100kb DHS volume were
analyzed through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Ingenuity Systems Rcid13 wwwingenuitycom
For all but three cases out of 20 two cell-types likely had too few signicant genes detected to
get reliable annotations the category Physiological System Development and Function was in
clear correspondence with that expected given the cell type SI Fig S14 For instance TH1 was
enriched for cell-mediated immune response K562 for hematological system development and
function and H7ESC for embryonic development For each gene there tended to be low relative
ARSi across the remaining cell types indicating that we detected truly cell-type specic genes as
clear outliers on a genome-wide scale However some cases showed large relative ARSi in a few
tissues which prompted us to investigate these instances further
Among genes with a statistically signicant ARSmax statistic additional inspection of the re-
maining ARSi were explored for detection of possible sub-structures We calculated relative ARS
values within each gene dividing all ARSi by ARSmax In addition to many instances of singu-
lar outliers we detected a gradient behavior among signicant genes where a few cell-types were
evident as outliers Fig S17
25 Local ARS Proles
The DHS data itself provides a rich source of information about regulatory elements in the genome
However when used in conjunction with gene expression data across diering cell types there is
an opportunity to discover which locations of chromatin accessibility drive gene expression in a
cell-type specic manner This goal prompted us to develop a technique to model the relationship
for ne-scale segments of DHS volume across the larger segments As the above strategy focused
on examination of chromatin gene expression interactions over genomic segments investigation of
ne-scale patterns allowed us to i validate that distal regulatory regions were indeed present as
peaks in chromatin accessibility concordant with gene expression in a cell-type specic manner ii
perform sequence analyses of these chromatin accessibility peaks iii compare localized associations
across cell-types or within a single gene and iv provide a framework for quantifying regions of
interest on a continuous scale for investigation of regulatory elements
We therefore extended our approach to allow one to identify and map DHS sites to genes
on which they show strong evidence for playing a regulatory role in a cell-type specic manner
This was carried out by providing a ne-scale version of the ARS quantication called a local
ARS prole for genes with a statistically signicant ARSmax statistic over a larger segment The
peaks of the local ARS proles pinpoint which DHS are most inuential in explaining the cell-type
specic gene expression variation thereby indicating that they have the most regulatory potential
We retained the gene expression values for a given signicant gene and now considered the DHS
volume within non-overlapping consecutive regions at a high resolution 60 base pair windows The
ARS statistic was calculated for each 60bp window which can then be plotted over the entire
region used in identifying the gene as statistical signicant For example for a gene signicant
with respect to a 200kb DHS volume we calculated 6700 local ARS statistics for each cell type
These can then be plotted in such a way that the signal emanating from that location is visible
loosely analogous to a LOD score prole in linkage analysis Additional steps were taken involving
scaling across the 60 bp windows to preserve a valid interpretation of their relative magnitudes
We rst selected the subset of local ARS prole peaks by thresholding the local ARS proles in
a principled manner Methods and we analyzed both positional biases and sequence compositions
as they relate to function We then analyzed the entire trajectories of local ARS proles at specic
loci showing that they identify both known and putative regulatory DHS for given genes
26 Positional bias of putative regulatory DHS
Because the overall statistical signicance increases when calculating DHS volume over more distal
regions up to 200kb Fig 2 we investigated the positional bias of local ARS peaks in a cell-
type specic manner Figure 3a shows smoothed densities of positional local ARS peak counts
by cell type which exhibit high cell-type specic dierences specically the density around the
TSS Random densities were generated by randomly assigning positional counts to tissues in equal
proportions to the observed counts where it can be seen that the cell-type dierences are no longer
present SI Fig S18 This points to the existence of cell-type specic biases in the base-pair
distance of regulatory DHS to TSS
27 Sequence analysis of peaks in local ARS proles
We next sought to characterize the functional signicance of sequences corresponding to local ARS
peaks Since a general indicator of functionality is conservation we extracted the conservation
track values phastCons44wayPrimate hg18 41 corresponding to the local ARS peaks and to
the negative control set Methods Values range from 0 to 1 with 1 indicating the most con-
served The regions with local ARS peaks were signicantly more conserved than regions from the
negative control set Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value  22e-16 SI Fig S19 indicating substantial
conservation of sequences corresponding to local ARS peaks
DNase-I hypersensitive sites are well established markers of regulatory and other DNA binding
proteins We therefore sought to establish if known cell-type specic transcription factors binding
sites TFBSs are over-represented in the local ARS peaks relative to the negative control set
Methods Since regions distal to the TSS are rarely studied in this context we eliminated all
local ARS peaks and negative controls that fell within 10 kb of the TSS This step was taken to
demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting distal TFBS up to 200kb from the
We utilized the JASPAR database 31 to identify TFBS that are dierentially represented in the
local ARS peaks relative to the negative control set Methods The over- and under-represented
TFBS show distinct cell-type specic patterns and provide a rich insight into cell-type specic gene
regulation Fig 3b several of which are listed here
 Among the hepatocyte nuclear factors we found HNF1B TCF-2 and HNF4A to have signif-
icant chromatin gene expression concordance in HRCE and HepG2 respectively SI Fig S20
and Fig S21 Furthermore we found the local ARS proles in the respective tissues to dis-
play a marked over-representation of the factor in question HNF1B in HRCE and HNF4A
Figure 3 Analysis of local ARS proles A Distribution of local ARS peaks relative to the TSS according to
cell type The positional bias of cell-type specic local ARS peaks as measured by the density of local ARS peaks
within cell lines with respect to position from to the TSS Clear dierences in the amount of distal regulation are
seen across the cell-types and the density around the TSS dier markedly among cell types For example HL60
shows a more proximal signal relative to that of HAEpiC B Transcription factor binding site analysis among local
ARS peaks occurring 10kb to 200kb from the TSS Sequences corresponding to local ARS peaks within signicant
cell-type specic genes were searched with known transcription factor binding site models and the relative over-
and under-representation was assessed based on a negative control set Instances of absolute log2 fold-change  2
are displayed within the relevant cell types Over-representation is indicative of a preferential transcription factor
binding site and is therefore a likely regulatory candidate for the observed gene expression Under-represented sites
indicate factors which should be avoided to maintain proper cell-type specic expression proles For instance Sox2
and Pou5f1 Oct4 were observed solely over-represented in the embryonic cells H7ESC

The dierentially represented TFBSs were distributed largely distal For all cell-types from 68
to 79 were located more than 50kb away from the TSS We repeated the analysis with only
the proximal regions 10kb from the TSS and we found that important known cell-type specic
motifs were no longer detected SI Fig S22
28 Mapping putative regulatory DHS to genes
We also investigated the utility of considering the entire trajectory of local ARS proles at a locus to
characterize the regulatory architecture of cell-type specic expression We investigated in detail
two well-characterized examples of regulatory interactions at the -globin HBB  locus control
region and at the stem cell leukemia SCL gene also known as TAL1 with several more appearing
in SI Figs S23-S35 It can be seen from these analyses that the local ARS proles provide a
means to map DHS sites to genes in a cell-type specic manner
The HBB -globin locus control region LCR comprises an array of functional elements that
in vivo gives rise to ve major DNase I hypersensitive sites HS1-HS5 49 14 19 Fig 4 upstream
of HBE1 -globin on the short arm of chromosome 11 All ve sites were present in cell line
K562 according to our DHS data see Figs S23- S27 for complete data across all 20 cell-types
and Fig S28 for local ARS proles across all genes at this locus control region Although the
DHS volume at these sites contributed to both HBE1 and HBB yielding statistically signicant
ARS values the relative importance of HS1-5 diers signicantly between these two genes clearly
detected by the local ARS proles Fig 4a
In the case of HBE1 we observed local ARS peaks for HS1 at -61kb and to a lesser extent
HS3 and HS4 -147 and -18kb respectively For HBB we observed similar local ARS proles for

and HBE1 in the K562 and HL60 cell lines The transparent yellow boxes indicate regulatory regions specically
hypersensitive regions 1-5 HS1-5 together with a less characterized site upstream of HBD It can be seen that HBB
and HBE1 show dierent local ARS proles indicative of dierences in usage of regulatory elements The local ARS

genomic segments Local ARS proles show a dominant eect from the 40 enhancer region green box spanning
PDZK1IP1 DHS signals across multiple cell-types were correctly not detected to be associated with the expression
of TAL1 Furthermore note that even though the DHS data for TAL1 and PDZK1IP1 are largely overlapping they
nevertheless have distinct local ARS proles due to their dierent patterns of gene expression This demonstrates that
ARS is capable of separating interwoven signals across cell-types for neighboring genes and that there is information

that HS1 is a stable chromatin structure 14 through out development and essential for HBE1
expression 40 due to a GATA-1 binding site while HS2 3 and 4 show synergistic enhancement
of expression of HBB by formation of the LCR holocomplex 15 27 48 Finally the element
upstream of HBD has also been reported to specically enhance transcription of HBB 1 While
HS5 is present in the DHS data for K562 similar open chromatin structures were detected in other
tissues HS5 -21kb is not in concordance with tissue-specic gene expression of either HBE1 or
HBB an observation in line with this sites function as an insulator and CTCF binding site 47
TAL1 encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein which is essential for the formation of all hematopoi-
etic lineages SI Figs S29- S31 for all data across the 20 cell-types Previous studies using chro-
matin structure comparative sequence analysis transfection assays 13 18 and transgenic mice
5 17 16 35 42 have identied a total of ve enhancers modulating the expression of TAL1 We
detect TAL1 as signicant with maximal cell line K562 across all tested genomic segments from
25KB to 200KB with the most signicant ARSmax occurring for 50kb Further investigation
by the local ARS prole Fig 4b showed that while proximal regulatory sites were correctly iden-
tied the most dominant signal is by far conned to the 40 enhancer region and is an order of
magnitude greater than other signals While the TAL1 40 region is downstream of PDZK1IP1
it was not linked to the expression of this gene which was detected as signicant in HRCE The
40 enhancer region has been shown to direct expression in transgenic mice to primitive but not
denitive erythoblasts such as the phenotype displayed by K562 This example demonstrates that
our methodology is capable of identifying regions of regulatory potential which otherwise requires
laborious eort to annotate
Local ARS proles showed both dierences and similarities across genes as well as cell-types
A few examples included
 CCR2 and CCR5 were signicant for two dierent cell-types HL60 and TH1 respectively
SI Fig S32
 Part of the HOX-cluster crucial for kidney development in mammals HOXD8 HOXD4 and
HOXD3  showed identical local ARS proles SI Fig S33 and all were signicant genes in
HRCE 9
 Another example of shared proles but across several cell-types instead of across several
genes was seen with LOXL2 a gene essential for biogenesis of connective tissue which is
detected as an outlier in SKMC and has high relative ARS values in HAEpiC and BJ SI
Fig S34 Further ne-scale investigation showed a solid overlap in the local ARS proles
Fig S35
These observations point to a potentially widespread sharing of regulatory mechanisms both across
genes and cell-types
3 Discussion
As the epigenome in multicellular organisms is a dynamic entity whose variation leads to repro-
gramming of gene expression 51 it is a likely candidate in the etiology of disease complementary
to that of mutations in DNA 39 20 It is therefore of considerable interest to identify and char-
acterize the regulatory regions contributing to gene expression variation with respect to a given
disease
We have presented a framework for quantifying relationships between chromatin structure and
gene expression across multiple conditions here cell-types facilitating a new avenue for under-
standing cellular responses by localizing and characterizing regions of regulatory potential The lo-
cal ARS proles we introduced allow specic hypersensitive regions to be associated with condition-
specic gene expression thereby conferring contextual regulatory information not obtainable using
DHS data alone This eectively pinpoints a shortlist of primary candidates for further functional
studies We found the peaks from the local ARS proles in statistically signicant segments to be
both highly conserved and enriched for known transcription factor binding sites as far as 200kb
from transcription start sites While beyond the scope of the current work we believe our approach
could be used in conjunction with quantitative trait analyses QTL to increase the power for de-
tecting true cis- and trans-acting SNP by interfering with transcription factor binding sites which
in turn leads to altered DHS signals in a similar manner as Degner et al 8
As measurements from high throughput sequencing platforms become commonplace in molec-
ular biology there will be an increasing demand for the development of new statistical approaches
for these data A major challenge is that sequencing measurements are rarely in units directly
relatable to one another eg DHS measures chromatin accessibility ChIP-seq measures binding
anity RNA-seq measures RNA molecule abundance etc Our framework provides the initial
development of a statistic which captures relationships among these measurements and enables
statistical testing of associations among them Moreover by exploiting variation across multiple
conditions the sensitivity of our approach should only increase with additional data and sources of
variation Hence the presented framework can likely be applied to test for associations between ap-
propriate continuous quantitative genomic measurements and gene expression thereby facilitating
a comparable basis for meta-analyses on the interplay of epigenetic features
4 Materials and Methods
41 DHS and gene expression data
The data used in this study were generated through the ENCODE consortium and are publicly
available Established cell lines and primary cells used in this study were procured from commercial
or other sources as listed in Table S1 The cells were cultured as per the vendor recommendations
and individual cell growth protocols are available in the UCSC human genome browser The DHS
data are available at the UCSC genome browser by downloading the track IDs listed in Table S2
and the web address shown therein Normalized probe-level expression data were obtained from
the Gene Expression Omnibus GEO the accession numbers for all arrays are shown in Table S4
Probes were mapped to genes according to HG18 using bowtie 25 allowing for 2 mismatches and
up to 10 maps to the genome including the best match Only probe sets for which all probes
had a unique best match and fully corresponded to exon boundaries found in RefSeq annotations
HG18 were retained for further analysis If a RefSeq gene had multiple splice variants these were
aggregated to a meta-gene structure In the rare event that a gene mapped to currently ambiguous
regions eg chr6 random such regions were not included To arrive at a gene specic expression
value the mean expression across all probe sets within the exon boundaries of the gene model was
calculated This yielded expression measures for 19215 genes on 20 cell lines
42 Statistical methods
The ARS algorithm and statistical analyses were written in the R programming language 33 The
main ARS algorithm results GO-analyses and preprocessed data are available at
httpencodeprincetonedu Complete details of the ARS algorithm including the null ran-
domization strategy and estimation of the angular penalty are provided in SI
A schematic of the method is shown in Fig 1 We represented the measurements of a single
gene by two paired vectors x  x1     xm for gene expression and y  y1     ym for DHS
volume where m is the number of cell-types under consideration here m  20 To place the two
variables on a common scale each vector was scaled by its maximum observation xs 
maxx1xm
and ys 
maxy1ym so that all values are now in 0 1 Each vector was then centered by its
median medxs and medys to form x  xs  medxs and y  ys  medys Hence the
data for a given gene and segment are now centered around the two-dimensional medoid where the
center of mass of the data lies at the origin If there is little variation across the multiple cell-types
all points would cluster around the medoid while singular cell-types displaying greater variation
would be present as distinct outliers SI Fig S9 and Fig S10 To gauge potential outliers the
i were calculated for every cell type i  1     m to produce the
medd  thereby
Euclidian distance di 
distance vector d  d1     dm We formed a ratio statistic according to ri  di
quantifying the relative distance of each point to the medoid
cid113
i  y2
i  y
While the ratios ri describe the dispersion of the data it does not account for any concordance
between the measurements A perfectly concordant relationship between the two measurements
would result in points lying along the 45 diagonal identity line We therefore calculated the angle
i  relative to the unit vector 1 0 for i  1     m where 0  i  360
i for each data point x
The angular penalty involves rst calculating the smaller of the two angular distances between
i and the identity line denoted as i For example i  45  i for 0  i  135 The
angular penalty is calculated as ai  expc  i where c is determined empirically to satisfy
a correct null distribution SI Therefore the value ai measures the penalized angular distance
of x
i  y
i  from the identity line in a symmetric fashion SI Fig S11 The statistic applied to
i  pair is then ARSi  ai  ri with the genes overall statistic being the maximum
i  y
each x
ARSmax  maxARS1 ARS2     ARSm In addition to calculating these quantities for each gene
we also recorded the ordering of the cell types as determined by their relative ARSi values
Inclusion of the angular penalty had a twofold purpose Firstly it correctly eliminated points
that were outliers in only one dimension gene expression or DHS alone and therefore not of interest
here since there is no direct relationship between the two measurements Secondly penalizing such
points acted as a tuning parameter adjusting for the degree of o-diagonal noise in data and thereby
ensured a correct null distribution and p-values Fig S12 The specic value of c was determined
such that observed null p-values over p  05 had a Uniform01 distribution according to a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test SI Reassuringly this lead to nearly identical values for c across all
genomic segment sizes of DHS volume considered SI Fig S13
The scaled data xs and ys for all genes were aggregated into a single distribution in the unit
square 0 1  0 1 From this randomized data sets were created by sampling 20 points that
preserves the fact that either one point must lie on 1 1 or two points lie on x 1 and 1 y re-
spectively The 20 sampled points are then median centered and the ARSmax statistic is calculated
We performed this 100 times to generate 100 sets of null ARSmax statistics for every gene for a
total of 100  19 215 null statistics A p-value was then formed for each gene by calculating the
frequency by which null statistics exceed the observed statistic The p-values were then utilized to
calculate FDR q-values for the genes as previously described 45 See SI for full details on this
randomization method
43 Selecting local ARS prole peaks for further analysis
We rst identied genes called signicant at FDR  010 for the ARS analysis performed on the
segment size of  200kb about the TSS We recorded the maximal cell-type for each of these
genes ie the cell type yielding the ARSmax value producing a list of signicant genecell-type
pairs We limited our selection of genecell-type pairs to those cell types that were maximal at this
threshold for at least 100 genes For each of these selected genecell-type pairs we scaled its local
ARS prole by the maximal value in the  200kb segment about the TSS All DNA sequences 
50bp with scaled local ARS prole value  05 were then selected as local ARS peaks Likewise
all DNA sequences  50bp with scaled local ARS prole value  02 were selected as the negative
control set The local ARS peak set consisted of a total of 38819 100bp regions and the negative
control set consisted of 156060 100bp regions
44 TFBS analysis
We took the above local ARS peaks and negative control set and we eliminated all segments
within  10kb of the TSS reducing the number of local ARS peak segments from 38819 to
32063 and negative control segments from 156060 to 148423 These were searched with all non-
redundant vertebrate positions count matrices in the JASPAR database 31 The position count
matrices were converted to position weight matrices using a uniform background and a matrix
specic thresholding of 08 of the maximal log-odds score was used Signicant over- or under-
representation was determined by exact binomial tests where the probability was based on the
frequency of hits per base pair in the negative control sequences Eect-size was calculated as log2
fold-change between number of hits per base pair in the local ARS peaks versus the negative control
