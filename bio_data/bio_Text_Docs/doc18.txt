Chemotactic cells of eukaryotic organisms are able to accurately sense shallow
chemical concentration gradients using cell-surface receptors This sensing ability
is remarkable as cells must be able to spatially resolve small fractional dierences
in the numbers of particles randomly arriving at cell-surface receptors by diusion
An additional challenge and source of uncertainty is that particles once bound and
released may rebind the same or a dierent receptor which adds to noise without
providing any new information about the environment We recently derived the
fundamental physical limits of gradient sensing using a simple spherical-cell model
but not including explicit particle-receptor kinetics Here we use a method based
on the uctuation-dissipation theorem FDT to calculate the accuracy of gradient
sensing by realistic receptors We derive analytical results for two receptors as well
as two coaxial rings of receptors eg one at each cell pole For realistic receptors
we nd that particle rebinding lowers the accuracy of gradient sensing in line with
our previous results
INTRODUCTION
Cells are able to sense gradients of chemical concentration with extremely high sensitivity
and accuracy This is done either directly by measuring spatial gradients across the cell
diameter or indirectly by temporally sensing gradients while moving 1
In temporal
sensing a cell modies its swimming behavior according to whether a chemical concentration
is rising or falling in time 2 This mode of sensing is typical of small fast moving bacteria
such as Escherichia coli which can respond to changes in concentration as low as 32 nM
of the attractant aspartate 3 In contrast direct spatial sensing is prevalent among larger
single-celled eukaryotic organisms such as the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum Dicty
and the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 4 5 Dicty cells are able to sense a
concentration dierence of only 1-5 across the cell 6 corresponding to a dierence in
receptor occupancy between front and back of only 5 receptors 7 Spatial sensing is also
performed by cells of the immune system including neutrophils and lymphocytes 8 as well
as by growing synaptic cells and tumor cells Interestingly a direct spatial mode of sensing
has also been demonstrated for the large oxygen-sensing bacterium Thiovulum majus 9
indicating that direct gradient sensing is widespread among the dierent kingdoms of life
There has been great progress in understanding the limits of concentration sensing in
bacteria such as E coli pioneered by Berg 2 10 11 and in understanding the origins
of sensitivity in the underlying signaling network pioneered by Bray 12 13 14 15 and
followed by others 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 By contrast very little is known about what
determines the accuracy of direct gradient sensing by eukaryotic cells Recently we derived
the fundamental physical limits of direct gradient sensing where the accuracy is limited by
the random arrival of particles at the cell surface due to diusion 23 We used as models
a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere a la Berg and Purcell 11
In these two models gradients are inferred from the positions of particles absorbed on the
surface of a sphere or the positions of freely diusing particles inside a spherical volume
respectively The latter case simulates rebinding of particles as particles can enter and exit
the spherical volume freely In comparison for the perfectly absorbing sphere previously
observed particles are never remeasured As a result we found that the perfectly absorbing
sphere is superior to the perfectly monitoring sphere both for concentration and gradient
sensing Table I
The superiority of the absorbing sphere may help explain the presence at the surfaces of
cells of signal degrading enzymes such as PDE for cAMP in Dicty and BAR1 for mating
factor  in S cerevisiae Those surface enzymes could reduce or eliminate rebinding and
therefore remeasurement of the same signal molecule Quantitatively our theory compares
favorably to recent measurements of Dicty moving up shallow cAMP gradients 7 suggesting
that these cells operate near the physical limits of gradient detection
While our recent models of the absorbing and monitoring spheres allowed us to derive
the fundamental limit of gradient sensing the models neglect the details of biochemical
reactions such as particle-receptor binding and downstream signaling events which might
further increase measurement uncertainty To study the eects of particle-receptor binding
we here extend a formalism for the uncertainty of concentration sensing recently developed
by Bialek and Setayeshgar 22 24 to the case of gradient sensing This formalism uses
the uctuation-dissipation theorem to infer the uctuations of the receptor occupancy and
hence the accuracy of concentration sensing from the linear response of the average receptor
occupancy to changes in receptor binding free energies The eect of particle rebinding
is included by coupling particle-receptor binding to the diusion equation 24 leading to
correlations in time among the receptors We report analytical results for two receptors Fig
1 as well as two coaxial rings of receptors eg one at each cell pole Fig 2 By assuming
diusion-limited particle binding to the receptors we are able to directly compare to our
previous model for the fundamental limits of gradient sensing For realistic receptors we
nd that particle rebinding lowers the accuracy of gradient sensing in line with our previous
results for the absorbing and monitoring spheres Table I

Following Bialek and Setayeshgar 24 we imagine that the mechanism that reads out the
receptor occupancy averages over a time  long compared to the correlation time between

where hnj2itot  nj1 nj is the total variance in each occupancy and cj  kcj k1
is the correlation time for receptor occupancy in the absence of rebinding The correlation
time cj is modied when rebinding is included via coupling to particle diusion so that the
eective correlation time for receptor occupancy increases to cj 1  j as shown by the
above equations For an equilibrium system with time-reversal symmetry the power spectra
are necessarily symmetric in the zero-frequency limit ie Sn1n20  Sn2n10 However
Sn1n20 Eq 23 and Sn2n10 Eq 24 are dierent depending on c1 and c2 respectively
Hence our approach based on the uctuation-dissipation theorem is only valid for shallow
gradients with c1  c2
To determine the uncertainty of gradient sensing we need to know the uncertainty in
measuring a concentration dierence This uncertainty can be obtained from the noise
power spectra for ligand binding and unbinding Eqs 21-24 Starting with the expression
n  cc  KD for the average occupancy in terms of the average concentration where
KD  kk we obtain the following relation

which expresses how a uctuation in the occupancy of receptor j aects the cells best esti-
mate of the local concentration To obtain the uncertainty of the gradient measurement we
require the variance of the estimated concentration dierence hc1  c22i which we cal-
culate using Eq 25 and substituting the previously calculated noise power spectra Snj nl0
For an averaging time   we obtain for the variance of the inferred concentration dierence

Two rings of receptors
Following Bialek and Setayeshgar 24 we next consider the case where a cell is equipped
with two rings of m receptors one at each pole We further assume that the cell length is
large enough so each receptor in Ring 1 is at nearly the same distance r from each receptor
in Ring 2 Fig 2 The equation governing receptor j in Ring 1 is

III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Many types of cells are known to measure spatial chemical gradients directly with high
accuracy In particular Dictyostelium discoideum is known to measure extremely shallow
gradients of cAMP important for fruiting body formation 4 6 7 and Saccharomyces cere-
visiae budding yeast detects shallow gradients of  mating pheromone 26 Direct spatial
sensing of gradients is also performed by cells of the immune system including neutrophils
and lymphocytes 8 as well as by the large marine bacterium Thiovulum majus 9 The
question arises what are the limits of the accuracy of gradient sensing set by chemical dif-
fusion Recently we derived fundamental physical limits for gradient sensing 23 using as
model cells a perfectly absorbing sphere and a perfectly monitoring sphere 11 We found
that a perfectly absorbing sphere is superior to a perfectly monitoring sphere for both con-
centration and gradient sensing since the perfectly absorbing sphere avoids the noise due
to remeasuring previously detected particles Table I Consequently our results for the
perfectly absorbing sphere represent the true fundamental limits of both concentration and
gradient sensing by cells
Our models of the absorbing and the monitoring spheres neglect all biochemical
reactions such as particle-receptor binding and downstream signaling events which
might further increase measurement uncertainty To study the eects of particle-receptor
binding we extended a formalism for the uncertainty of concentration sensing recently
developed by Bialek and Setayeshgar 24 to gradient sensing This formalism uses the
uctuation-dissipation theorem to infer the uctuations of the receptor occupancy and
hence the accuracy of concentration sensing from the linear response of the average
receptor occupancy to changes in receptor binding free energies The eect of particle
rebinding is included by coupling particle-receptor binding to the diusion equation 24
leading to correlations in time among the receptors
Single receptor for concentration sensing
It is instructive to rst review the result for a single receptor without and with coupling
to particle diusion corresponding respectively to preventing and allowing rebinding of
already measured particles 24 The uncertainty of sensing concentration c0 without re-
binding ie assuming that upon unbinding the particle is removed from the system is
given by
hc2
k1  n
2Ds
where k is the rate constant for binding n is the average receptor occupancy and  is the
averaging time The right hand side of Eq 35 is obtained for diusion-limited binding in
which case k1  n  4Ds with D the diusion constant and s the receptor dimension
This is the well-known fundamental limit derived by Berg and Purcell 11 In contrast the
uncertainty of concentration sensing including particle diusion and possible rebinding is
given by Bialek and Setayeshgar as 24
hc2
21  c0
k1  n
k1  n
2Ds
where   k1  n2Ds Comparison of Eq 35 and Eq 36 shows that the uncertainty
of concentration sensing by a single receptor is larger by the term c0Ds  when allowing
for rebinding of already measured particles For the minimum uncertainty case set by
diusion-limited binding and given by the right hand side of Eq 36 this additional term
simply leads to a factor of 3 increase to the fundamental limit derived by Berg and Purcell
Eq 35
Two receptors for gradient sensing
As derived in Methods see Eq 28 we nd that the uncertainty of gradient measurement
is given by
hc1  c22

As expected the larger the receptor-receptor separation r the smaller the uncertainty in
the gradient because of the larger lever arm between receptors Note that the result in
Eq 37 for the uncertainty in the gradient is independent of the magnitude of the actual
gradient including the case when there is no real gradient present For comparison the
uncertainty of mean concentration measurement is 24

k1  n
2D cid181
2rcid19 
Analogous to the single receptor case Eq 36 the rst term in Eqs 37 and 38 arises from
particle-receptor binding kinetics whereas the second term is due to diusion and includes
the eects of possible rebinding of already measured particles Due to the proximity of the
receptors separated by distance r a particle can unbind one receptor and subsequently
rebind the other receptor because of diusion see Fig 1 trajectory 2 Hence there is an
additional noise component which actually improves the accuracy of gradient measurement
term  12r due to cancellation with the noise due to rebinding to the same receptor
but degrades the accuracy of mean concentration measurement term  12r since
rebinding to the other receptor can only increase noise in the estimate of the mean
concentration This correlated noise was recently also investigated with Monte Carlo
simulations 27
Two rings of receptors for gradient sensing
We next consider two rings of receptors parallel to one another at opposite cell ends a
distance r apart Fig 2 As derived in Methods see Eq 34 we nd that the uncertainty
of gradient measurement is given by
hc1  c22
 ir2 
mk1  nr2

where m is the number of receptors per ring and  is a geometric factor close to unity For
comparison the uncertainty of mean concentration measurement is 24

2rcid19 
The factor 1m in Eqs 39 and 40 reects signal averaging by multiple receptors which
reduces the measurement uncertainty with respect to the case of two receptors The
possibility of rebinding to other receptors within the same ring leads to correlations among
the signals which are reected in the extra term 2 in the rebinding noise
Comparison with the perfect monitor and the perfect absorber models
To make comparison to our results for the perfectly absorbing and monitoring spheres Table
I which do not include particle-receptor kinetics we replace k1  nc0 by 4Dsc0 for the
minimum uncertainty case set by diusion-limited binding To specically compare with the
perfectly absorbing sphere we neglect the second term in Eqs 39 and 40 thereby neglecting
rebinding of particles and obtain for gradient and concentration sensing

respectively To specically compare with the perfectly monitoring sphere we keep both
terms in Eqs 39 and 40 and obtain for gradient and concentration sensing

The parameter a  ms is the combined receptor dimension ultimately limited by the cell
dimension Note that in Eqs 41 and 43 for gradient sensing we normalized by c0r2 and
in Eqs 42 and 44 for concentration sensing we normalized by c2
0 in order to use the same
notation as Table I and Ref 23
As a result for r  s ie receptor separation larger than receptor size the measurement
43 and 44 is always larger than the measurement
uncertainty with rebinding Eqs
uncertainty without rebinding Eqs
41 and 42 for both gradient and concentration
sensing Hence the absorber is superior to the monitor even when receptor binding
kinetics are explicitly included in line with our previous nding Table I Specically
for diusion-limited binding the dominant eect of particle rebinding Eqs 43 and 44
is simply an increased numerical prefactor also in line with our results for the perfect
absorber and perfect monitor models
In conclusion we found that the accuracy of concentration and gradient measurement
without ligand rebinding is higher than the accuracy with rebinding conrming the supe-
riority of the absorber over the monitor 23 Our model of two coaxial rings qualitatively
resembles the polar clusters found abundantly in bacteria and archaea 28 Hence our
model may be directly suitable for describing the concentration sensing by these organisms
and possibly also for oxygen-gradient sensing by the bacterium Thiovulum majus 9 Fur-
thermore a number of mechanistic models for gradient sensing and chemotaxis by eukaryotic
cells have addressed the important questions of cell polarization signal amplication and
adaptation 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 cell movement of individual cells 36 37 cell aggre-
gation 38 as well as sensing of uctuating concentrations 24 27 39 40 Our results on
the accuracy of gradient sensing complement these models and may ultimately help lead to
a comprehensive description of eukaryotic chemotaxis 41
