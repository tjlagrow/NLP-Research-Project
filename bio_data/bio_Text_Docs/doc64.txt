In recent years experiments have demonstrated that living cells can measure low chemical con-
centrations with high precision and much progress has been made in understanding what sets the
fundamental limit to the precision of chemical sensing Chemical concentration measurements start
with the binding of ligand molecules to receptor proteins which is an inherently noisy process es-
pecially at low concentrations The signaling networks that transmit the information on the ligand
concentration from the receptors into the cell have to lter this noise extrinsic to the cell as much
as possible These networks however are also stochastic in nature which means that they will also
add noise to the transmitted signal In this review we will rst discuss how the diusive transport
and binding of ligand to the receptor sets the receptor correlation time and then how downstream
signaling pathways integrate the noise in the receptor state we will discuss how the number of re-
ceptors the receptor correlation time and the eective integration time together set a fundamental
limit on the precision of sensing We then discuss how cells can remove the receptor noise while
simultaneously suppressing the intrinsic noise in the signaling network We describe why this mech-
anism of time integration requires three classes of resourcesreceptors and their integration time
readout molecules energyand how each resource class sets a fundamental sensing limit We also
briey discuss the scheme of maximum-likelihood estimation the role of receptor cooperativity and
how cellular copy protocols dier from canonical copy protocols typically considered in the compu-
tational literature explaining why cellular sensing systems can never reach the Landauer limit on
the optimal trade-o between accuracy and energetic cost

INTRODUCTION
Living cells can sense changes in their environment
with extraordinary precision Receptors in our visual sys-
tem can detect single photons 1 some animals can smell
single molecules 2 swimming bacteria can respond to
the binding and unbinding of only a limited number of
molecules 3 4 and eukaryotic cells can respond to a
dierence in  10 molecules between the front and the
back of the cell 5 Recent experiments suggest that the
precision of the embryonic development of the fruity
Drosophila is close to the limit set by the available num-
ber of regulatory proteins 68 This raises the question
what is the fundamental limit to the precision of chemical
concentration measurements
Living cells measure chemical concentrations via re-
ceptor proteins which can either be at the cell surface
or inside the cell These measurements are inevitably
corrupted by two sources of noise One is the stochastic
transport of the ligand molecules to the receptor via dif-
fusion the other is the binding of the ligand molecules
to the receptor after they have arrived at its surface
Berg and Purcell pointed out in the seventies that cells
can reduce the sensing error by increasing the number
of measurements and that they can do so in two prin-
cipal ways 3 The rst is to simply increase the num-
ber of receptors The other is to increase the number of
measurements per receptor
In the latter scenario the
cell infers the ligand concentration not from the instan-
taneous ligand-binding state of the receptor but rather
from its average over some integration time T  This time
integration has to be performed by the signaling network
downstream of the receptor proteins
In recent years tremendous progress has been made in
understanding how accurately cells can measure chem-
ical concentrations 3 5 922 Most of these studies
assume that the cell estimates the concentration via the
mechanism of time integration as envisioned by Berg and
Purcell 3 5 911 13 1521 although Mora Endres
Wingreen and others have shown that under certain con-
ditions a better estimate of the concentration can be ob-
tained via maximum likelihood estimation 12 14 22 In
this review we will limit ourselves to sensing static con-
centrations which do not change on the timescale of the
response and we will focus on the mechanism of time in-
tegration although we will also briey discuss the scheme
of maximum likelihood estimation This review will fol-
low a series of papers written by the authors but in
doing so will also discuss other relevant papers
Specically in this review we will address the follow-
ing questions if the downstream signaling network inte-
grates the state of the receptor over some given integra-
tion time T  what is then the sensing error This is the
question that was rst addressed by Berg and Purcell 3
and later followed up by many authors 5 911 13 17
19 The answer depends on the correlation time of the
receptor which is determined by the stochastic arrival
of the ligand molecules at the receptor by diusion and
on the stochastic binding of the ligand molecules to the
receptor Recently the correct expression for the corre-
lation time and hence the sensing error has become the
subject of debate 3 9 19 which we will review in sec-
tion II The next question is How do signaling networks
integrate the receptor state Do they integrate it uni-
formly in time as assumed by Berg and Purcell If not
can cellular sensing systems then actually reach the sens-
ing limit of Berg and Purcell As we will see signaling
networks can not only reach the Berg-Purcell limit but
in some cases even beat it by 12 15
Importantly the signaling network downstream of the
receptor is stochastic in nature which means that while
the network is removing the extrinsic noise in the re-
ceptor signal it will also add its own intrinsic noise to
the transmitted signal Most studies have ignored this
intrinsic noise in the signaling network essentially as-
suming that it can be made arbitrarily small 3 5 9
13 15 1719 2224 However can signaling networks
remove the extrinsic noise in the input signal and simulta-
neously suppress the intrinsic noise of the signaling net-
work 20 21 If so what resourcesreceptors time
readout molecules energyare required Do these re-
sources fundamentally limit sensing like weak links in a
chain Or can they compensate each other leading to
trade-os between them We will see that equilibrium
networks which are not driven out of thermodynamic
equilibrium can senseenergy dissipation is not essen-
tial for sensing 21 However their sensing accuracy is
limited by the number of receptors adding a downstream
network can never improve the precision of sensing This
is because equilibrium sensing systems face a fundamen-
tal trade-o between the removal of extrinsic and intrin-
sic noise 21 Only non-equilibrium systems can lift this
trade-o they can integrate the receptor state over time
while suppressing the intrinsic noise by using energy to
store the receptor state into stable chemical modication
states of the readout molecules 16 20 21 Storing the
state of the bound receptor over time using a canonical
push-pull signaling network requires at least one readout
molecule to store the state and at least 4kBT of energy
to store it reliably 20 Non-equilibrium systems thus
require three resource classes that are fundamentally re-
quired for sensingreceptors and their integration time
readout molecules and energy Each resource class sets a
fundamental sensing limit which means that the sensing
precision is bounded by the limiting resource class and
cannot be enhanced by increasing another class
Last but not least we will address the question of
whether cellular sensing involves computations that can
be understood using ideas from the thermodynamics of
computation 25 26 Cells seem to copy the ligand-
binding state of the receptor into chemical modica-
tion states of downstream readout molecules 16 20 21
but can this process be rigorously mapped onto compu-
tational protocols typically considered in the computa-
tional literature 27 If so how do these cellular copy
protocols compare to thermodynamically optimal proto-
cols Can they reach the Landauer bound which states
that the fundamental limit on the energetic cost of an
irreversible computation is kBT ln2 per bit We will
see that cellular copy operations dier fundamentally in
their design from thermodynamically optimal protocols
and that as a result they can never reach the Landauer
limit regardless of parameters 27
II THE BERG-PURCELL LIMIT
A Set up of the problem
Berg and Purcell and subsequent authors 3 5 9
11 13 1719 24 considered the scenario in which the
cell estimates the ligand concentration c assumed to be
constant on the timescale of the response by monitor-
ing the occupancy of the receptor to which the ligand
molecules bind and unbind The key idea is that the
cell infers the concentration by estimating the true av-
erage receptor occupancy n from the average occupancy
nT over some integration time T  and by inverting the
input-output relation nc 3 A central result is that for
a single receptor The time average of its occupancy nt

Using error propagation the fractional error in the esti-
mate of the concentration cc is then given by
over the integration time T is nT  1T cid82 T

where nT is the variance in the time-averaged occupancy
nT  and dndc is the gain which determines how the er-
ror in the estimate of n propagates to that in the estimate
of c The gain can be obtained from the input-output re-
lation nc  ccKD where KD is the receptor-ligand
binding anity dndc  n1  nc In the limit that
the integration time T is much longer than the receptor

sion shows that the variance in the average nT is given by

surements of nt Inserting Eq 2 into Eq 1 yields
cid18 c
cid192
p1  pT
This is indeed the sensing error based on T 2c inde-
pendent concentration measurements
Eq 3 holds for any single receptor be it a promoter on
the DNA a receptor on the cell membrane or a receptor
protein freely diusing inside the cytoplasm 28 All we
need to do to get the sensing error is to nd the receptor
correlation time c which depends on the scenario by
which the ligand nds the receptor
B Expression of Berg and Purcell
To obtain the receptor correlation time c Berg and
Purcell assumed that the ligand binds the receptor in a
Markovian fashion which means that c is given by
kf c  kb
where kf is the ligand-receptor binding rate and kb is the
unbinding rate Berg and Purcell described the binding
site as a circular patch on the membrane with patch ra-
dius s To get the forward rate kf  they assumed kf is
given by the diusion-limited binding rate kD but with
the cross section s renormalized by the sticking proba-
bility For the binding of a ligand to a membrane patch
kf  kD  4Ds We will consider the binding of lig-
and to a spherical receptor protein with ligand-receptor
cross section  in which case kf  kD  4D To
get the backward rate kb Berg and Purcell exploited the
detailed-balance condition kf c1 p  pkb which states
that in steady state the net rate of binding equals the net
rate of unbinding
Combining Eqs 3 and 4 yields the following expression
of Berg and Purcell for the sensing error
cid18 c
cid192
4Dc1  pT
This expression can be understood intuitively The factor
4Dc is the rate at which ligand molecules arrive at the
receptor 1 p is the probability that the receptor is free
and hence 4Dc1  p is the count rate at which the
receptor binds the ligand molecules 4Dc1  p mul-
tiplied with T is thus the total number of counts in the
integration time T  Indeed this expression states that
the fractional error cc decreases with the square root
of the number of counts as we would expect intuitively
While this expression makes sense intuitively there
are two problems First receptor-ligand binding is in
general not Markovian To illustrate this imagine for
the sake of the argument that a ligand-bound receptor
is surrounded by a uniform equilibrium distribution of
ligand molecules
If the receptor-bound ligand dissoci-
ates then the other ligand molecules will still have the
equilibrium distribution If it rebinds and then dissoci-
ates again the other ligand molecules will again still have
the equilibrium distribution The problem arises when a
the rebinding of the dissociated ligand molecule is pre-
empted by the binding of another ligand molecule and
b if this second molecule dissociates from the receptor
before the rst has diused into the bulk If this happens
then the receptor and the dissociated ligand molecule at
contact are no longer surrounded by a uniform equilib-
rium distribution of ligand molecules Indeed the process
of binding generates non-trivial spatio-temporal correla-
tions between the positions of the ligand molecules which
depend on the history of the association and dissociation
events This turns an association-dissociation reaction
into a complicated non-Markovian many-body problem
which can in general not be solved analytically
The second problem of the analysis of Berg and Purcell
is that not all ligand-receptor association reactions are
diusion limited Berg and Purcell were fully aware of
this but they argued on p 208 of Ref
3 that if the
ligand doesnt stick on its rst contact it may very soon
bump into the site againand again If these encounters
occur with a time interval short compared to b the time
a ligand is bound their result is equivalent merely to a
larger value of  the sticking probability As we have
no independent denition of the patch radius s we may
as well absorb the eective  into s This argument
however does not take into account that when a ligand
arrives at the receptor for the rst time and does not stick
immediately it may also return to the bulk after which
another ligand molecule may bind Moreover a ligand
molecule that has just dissociated from the receptor may
either rapidly rebind the receptor or diuse away from
it into the bulk It thus remained unclear how accurate
the expression of Berg and Purcell Eq 5 is
C Expression of Bialek and Setayeshgar
Bialek and Setayesghar sought to generalize the result
of Berg and Purcell by explicitly taking into account the
receptor-ligand binding dynamics 9 They considered a
model in which the ligand molecules can diuse bind the
receptor upon contact with an intrinsic association rate
ka and unbind from the receptor with an intrinsic disso-
ciation rate kd This model is described by the following
reaction-diusion equations
cx t
 kacx0 t1  nt  kdnt
 D2cx t  x  x0
where cx t is the concentration of ligand at position
x at time t and x0 is the position of the receptor To
solve these equations Bialek and Setayesghar invoked the
uctuation-dissipation relation leading to a linearization
of Eqs 6 and 7
The resulting expression for the sensing error is
DcT
kac 1  p T
The rst term describes the contribution to the sens-
ing error from the stochastic transport of the ligand
cid18 c
cid192
molecules to the receptor by diusion The second term
describes the contribution from the intrinsic stochasticity
of the binding kinetics of the receptor Even in the limit
that D   such that the ligand concentration is uni-
form in space at all times the ligand concentration can
still not be measured with innite precision because the
receptor stochastically switches between the bound and
unbound states leading to noise in the estimate of the
receptor occupancy This term is absent in Eq 5 since
Berg and Purcell assume that the binding reaction is fully
diusion limited meaning that the intrinsic rates ka and
kd go to innity Indeed for fast diusion-limited reac-
tions this term can be much smaller than the rst one
The rate ka is the rate of ligand-receptor binding given
that receptor and ligand are in contact
Its maximum
rate is given by transition-state theory which yields the
rate kTST in the absence of any recrossings of the dividing
surface that separates the bound from the unbound state
29 30 It is given by kTST  k0 expF  where F
is the free-energy barrier separating the bound form the
unbound state and k0 is a kinetic prefactor For spheri-
cal molecules that can bind in any orientation it is given
by k0  2 cid104vRLcid105 where vRL is the relative velocity
of ligand and receptor For diusion-limited reactions
a  k0  2 cid104vRLcid105 which is typically
F  0 and kmax
much larger than the diusion-limited rate kD  4D
More generally the rst term on the right-hand side
Eq 8 presents a noise oor that is solely due to the
stochastic transport of the ligand to the receptor by dif-
fusion independent of the binding kinetics of the ligand
after it has arrived at the receptor The rst term is
thus considered to be the fundamenetal sensing limit set
by the physics of diusion 9 and it can be compared
with the expression of Berg and Purcell Eq 5
clear that the expression of Bialek and Setayesghar and
that of Berg and Purcell dier by a factor 121  p
This dierence can have marked implications Although
the Bialek-Setayeshgar expression predicts that the un-
certainty due to diusion remains bounded even in the
limit that p  1 the Berg-Purcell expression suggests
that it diverges in this limit Intuitively we expect a de-
pendence on p because a higher receptor occupancy at
xed kD should reduce the count rate
D The expression of Kaizu and coworkers
To elucidate the discrepancy between Eqs 5 and 8
Kaizu and coworkers rederived the expression for the
sensing error 19 They considered exactly the same
model as that of Bialek and Setayesghar 9 but analyzed
it using the large body of work on reaction-diusion sys-
tems developed by Agmon Szabo and coworkers 31
The goal is to obtain the zero-frequency limit of the cor-
relation function cid98Cs  0 from which the correlation
time and hence the sensing error can be obtained see
Eq 2 The correlation function of any binary switching
process is given by
Cn    p0cid0p    p0cid1
cid90 t
where p0  n is the equilibrium probability for the bound
state  and p   cid104n n0cid105n is the probability
the receptor is bound at t   given it was bound at
t  0 To obtain the correlation function we thus need
p   1  Srev t where Srev t is the probabil-
ity that the receptor is free at time t given that it was
occupied at time t  0 It is given by the exact expression
Srev t  kd
1  Srev tcid48 Srad t  tcid48 dtcid48
The subscript rev denotes that a reversible reaction
is considered meaning that in between t  0 and t the
receptor may bind and unbind ligand a number of times
The probability that a receptor-ligand pair dissociates
between tcid48 and tcid48 dtcid48 to form an unbound pair at contact
is kd1 Srevtcid48dtcid48 while the probability that the free
receptor with a ligand molecule at contact at time tcid48 is
still unbound at time t  tcid48 is Sradttcid48 the subscript
rad means that we now consider an irreversible reaction
kd  0 which can be obtained by solving the diusion
equation using a radiation boundary condition 31
While Eq 10 is exact it cannot be solved analytically
because as discussed above an association-dissociation
reaction is a non-Markovian many-body problem To
solve Eq 10 Kaizu and coworkers made the assump-
tion that after each receptor-ligand dissociation event
the other ligand molecules have the uniform equilibrium
distribution Mathematically this assumption can be ex-
pressed as
Srad t  Srad teq Srad t 
where Sradteq is the probability that a receptor which
initially is free and surrounded by an equilibrium dis-
tribution of ligand molecules remains free until at least
a later time t while Sradt is the probability that a
free receptor that is surrounded by only one single ligand
molecule which initially is at contact is still unbound
at a later time t To solve Eqs 10 and 11 a relation
be obtained from Srad teq  eccid82 t
between Srad teq and Srad t is needed which can
32 and
the detailed-balance relation for the time-dependent bi-
molecular rate constant kradt  kaSradt 31
0 kradtcid48dtcid48
With these relations Eqs 10 and 11 can be solved
which together with Eqs 2 and 9 yields the following
expression for the the sensing error 19
cid18 c
cid192
4Dc 1  p T
kac 1  p T
The second term is identical to that of Bialek and Se-
tayesghar Eq 8 However the rst term which consti-
tutes the fundamental limit disagrees with the expres-
sion of Bialek and Setaeysghar but agrees with that of
Berg and Purcell Eq 5 This suggests that the expres-
sion of Berg and Purcell is indeed the most accurate ex-
pression for the fundamental sensing limit
But it could of course be that both the analysis of Berg
and Purcell and that of Kaizu et al are inaccurate To
investigate this Kaizu and coworkers performed particle-
based simulations of the same model studied by Bialek
and Setayesghar and Kaizu et al to test the expression
of Berg and Purcell the system was chosen to be deep
in the diusion-limited regime The simulations were
performed using Greens Function Reaction Dynamics
which is an exact algorithm to simulate reaction-diusion
systems at the particle level in time and space and hence
does not rely on the approximation used to derive the an-
alytical result of Kaizu et al 3335 Fig 1 shows the
results for the zero-frequency limit of the power spec-
trum Pn  0  22
nc which provides a test for the
receptor correlation time c and hence the sensing error
see Eqs 1 and 2 because 2
It is seen
that the prediction of Kaizu and coworkers agrees very
well with the simulation results in contrast to that of
Bialek and Setagesghar This shows that the expression
of Kaizu et al and hence that of Berg and Purcell is the
most accurate expression for the sensing precision

E Role of rebinding
The question remains why the analysis of Kaizu et
is so accurate The central assumption of Eq 11
makes the propensity for binding the next ligand inde-
pendent of the history of the previous binding events In
essence it reduces the non-Markovian many-body prob-
lem to a Markovian two-body problem which can be
seen from the expression for the receptor correlation time

for the correlation time of a receptor that switches in
a memoryless fashion between the bound and unbound
states with switching rates konc and ko 
But why is Eq 11 accurate And what is the role of
rebindings Do they not generate an algebraic tail in
the correlation function As it turns out these ques-
tions are intimately related It is well known that in an
unbounded system the correlation function exhibits an
algebraic tail because at long times the relaxation of the
receptor state is dominated by the slow diusive trans-
port of the ligand over long distances 36 37 However
we typically expect the space to be bounded both for
the binding of ligand to a receptor inside the cell and to
a receptor at the cell surface
Indeed the simulations
of 19 were performed in a nite box of cellular dimen-
sions yielding exponential not algebraic decay at long
times We then expect Eq 11 to become accurate More
specically assumption Eq 11 breaks down when a the
rebinding of a dissociated particle is pre-empted by the
binding of another particle from the bulk and b if this
second particle dissociates from the receptor before the
rst has equilibrated by diusing into the bulk However
the time a ligand molecule spends near the receptor is
typically much shorter than the time for molecules to ar-
rive from the bulk at biologically relevant concentrations
which means that the probability of rebinding interfer-
ence is very small and condition a is not met Because
biologically relevant concentrations are low also the dis-
sociation rates are typically low which means that also
condition b is not met The likelihood that both condi-
tions are met necessary for the analysis to break down
is thus very small 19
Because rebindings are so much faster than bulk ar-
rivals they can be integrated out 19 38 39 The prob-
ability that a particle that has just dissociated from the
receptor will rebind the receptor rather than diuse away
into the bulk is preb  1  Srad  kaka  kD
The mean number of rounds of rebinding and dissoci-
ation before the molecules diuse into the bulk is then

This analysis also elucidates the role of rebinding in
sensing The probability of rebinding does not depend
on the concentration and rebindings therefore do not
provide information on the concentration They merely
increase the receptor correlation time by increasing the
eective receptor on-time from k1

ing the molecule escapes into the bulk and then another

Importantly this molecule will bind in a

concentration This binding event thus provides an inde-
pendent concentration measurement The mean waiting

Indeed the sensing error cc decreases with the square
root of the number of independent measurements T w
during the integration time T 
Lastly why does the expression of Bialek and Se-
tayesghar Eq 8 miss the factor 1  p in the diu-
sion term We believe that this is because by invok-
ing the uctuation-dissipation theorem Bialek and Se-
tayesghar eectively linearize the reaction-diusion prob-
lem thereby ignoring correlations between the state of
the receptor and the local ligand concentration This
idea is supported by the analysis of Berezhkovskii and
Szabo 24 who recently derived an expression for the
accuracy of sensing via multiple receptors on a sphere
ignoring spatio-temporal correlations between the states
of the respective receptor molecules and the ligand con-
centration
Interestingly in the limit that the number
of receptors on the sphere goes to innity then by re-
placing the radius of the cell with the cross section of
the receptor their expression becomes identical to that
of Bialek and Setayesghar see also Eq 28 below indeed
this expression does not contain the factor 1  p This
can be understood by noting that in the limit that the
number of receptors becomes large there will always be
receptor molecules available for binding the ligand But
for a single receptor we have to take the binary character
of the receptor state into account

III CAN CELLS REACH THE BERG-PURCELL
The work of Berg and Purcell and subsequent studies
like those discussed above 3 5 911 13 1719 assume
not only a given integration time T  but also that the
downstream signaling network averages the state of the
receptor uniformly in time over this integration time T 
It remained unclear however how the signaling network
determines the eective integration time T  whether the
network averages the signal uniformly in time and how
this assumption aects the sensing precision 15 It thus
remained open whether signaling networks can actually
reach the Berg-Purcell limit
To address these questions the authors of Ref
considered linear but otherwise arbitrary signaling net-
work For deterministic networks of this type the output
XTo at time To can be written as
To  tcid48RLtcid48dtcid48
where t  tcid48 is the response function of the network
and RLt is the stochastic receptor signal To compare
to previous results the authors assumed that at t  0
the environment changes instantaneously and that the
receptors and hence RLt immediately adjust so that
RLt is stationary for 0  t  To with uctuations
that decay exponentially with correlation time c 19
Moreover they assumed that either 1 To  t  0
for t  0 which corresponds to a scenario where the
response time r of the network is shorter than To or
equivalently the network reaches steady state by the time
To or 2 RLt  0 for t  0 which corresponds to a
scenario in which the cell is initially in a basal state In
0 Totcid48RLtcid48dtcid48 When neither
Tot nor RLt are zero for t  0 then previous states
of the environment inuence the state of the network at
To which can either be a source of noise or a source of
information if the environments are correlated
both cases Xt cid82 To
The idea is that the cell infers the ligand concentration
from the output XT0 and by inverting the input-output
relation Xc Using error propagation the error in the
estimate of the concentration is then given by

The authors of Ref 15 then studied dierent signal-
ing architectures shown in Fig 2 Clearly these net-
works do not in general average the receptor signal uni-
formly in time instead they have non-uniform weighting
functions Fig 2ACEG They weigh receptor signals
in the past with a response function that depends on
both the lifetime of the signaling molecules and on the
topology of the signaling network One-layer networks
consisting of a single reversible reaction give most weight
to the most recent signal value left-most column while
FIG 2 Extracting information from noisy input signals with linear signaling networks ACEG The weighting functions
corresponding to dierent signaling networks are not uniform BDFH The ability of a signaling network to measure ligand
concentration depends on its weighting function The typical error variance in the estimate of ligand concentration is plotted
as a percentage increase over the error of an estimate based on uniform weighting assumed in the Berg-Purcell limit Eq 1

multi-level cascades consisting of irreversible reactions
give more weight to signal values more in the distant past
second column This concept can be generalized to ar-
bitrarily large signaling networks Multilevel reversible
cascades have weighting functions that peak at some -
nite time in the past balancing the down-weighting of
the signal from the distant past due to the reverse re-
actions with the down-weighting of the signal from the
recent past resulting from the multilevel character of the
network Linear combinations of the weighting functions
for reversible and irreversible cascades can be achieved
with multiple cascades that are activated by the input in
parallel and which independently activate the same eec-
tor molecule Clearly signaling networks allow for very
diverse weighting functions
This idea can be exploited to improve the accuracy
of sensing as shown in the right two columns of Fig 2
A network with a feedforward topology that combines
a fast reversible cascade with a slow irreversible cascade
cannot only reach the Berg-Purcell limit but even beat it
by 12 when the observation time To is on the order of
the receptor correlation time c The reason is that this
network selectively amplies the more recent signal val-
ues and those further back in the past This is benecial
because these signal values are less correlated
study shows that there can be a competing eect in favor
of increasing the number of nodes better removal of ex-
trinsic noise Additional nodes make it possible to sculpt
the weighting function for averaging the incoming signal
allowing signaling networks to reach and even exceed the
Berg-Purcell limit
IV FUNDAMENTAL SENSING LIMIT OF
EQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS
Signaling networks are stochastic in nature which
means that while they may remove the extrinsic noise
in the input signal they will also add their own intrinsic
noise to the transmitted signal Most studies on the ac-
curacy of sensing have ignored this intrinsic noise of the
signaling network 3 5 913 15 1719 22 23 They es-
sentially assume that the intrinsic noise can be made ar-
bitrarily small and that the extrinsic noise in the receptor
signal can be ltered with arbitrary precision by simply
integrating the receptor signal for longer However the
extrinsic and intrinsic noise are not generally indepen-
dent 40 This raises the question whether the extrinsic
and intrinsic noise can be lowered simultaneously and if
so what resources would be required to achieve this
While the data processing inequality suggests that it
is advantageous to limit the number of nodes in a signal-
ing network to minimize the eect of intrinsic noise this
To address these questions the authors of 21 rst
studied equilibrium networks that are not driven out of
thermodynamic equilibrium via the turnover of fuel In-
spired by one component signaling networks 41 they
started with the simplest possible equilibrium network

rectly bind ligand-free receptors R RL cid10 RL RX

This decomposition is not unique but in this form the
extrinsic noise term features a canonical temporal aver-
age of the input receptor uctuations 40 42 43 which
can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the eective
integration time of the network However the authors
of Ref
21 found that when doing so in a system with
RT receptors would reduce the total sensing error below
4RT  the intrinsic noise would inevitably rise The net-
work faces a fundamental trade-o between the removal
of extrinsic and intrinsic noise
Signaling networks are usually far more complicated
than one consisting of a single readout species and as
discussed in the previous section additional network lay-
ers can reduce the sensing error 15 This raises the
question whether a more complicated equilibrium net-
work can overcome the limit set by the number of re-
ceptors Searching over all possible network topologies
to address this question is impossible However equilib-
rium systems are fundamentally bounded by the laws of
equilibrium thermodynamics regardless of their topol-
ogy Indeed starting from the grand-canonical partition
function one can show that for any equilibrium network
the gain dXd with   0  kT logc the chemi-
cal potential of the ligand is given by the co-variance
XRL between X and RL because RL or in general
the complex containing the ligand is the species conju-
gate to the chemical potential This means that these
systems face a trade-o between gain sensitivity and
noise increasing the gain inevitably increases the noise
This has marked implications using dXd  2
and Eq 18 we nd that the sensing error based on the
readout X is cc2

ceptors themselves are taken as the readout the sensing

limited by the total number of receptors RT  regardless
of how complicated the downstream network is or how
many protein copies are devoted to making it
RL  R2
What is the origin of the sensing limit in equilibrium
sensing systems These systems transduce the signal by
harvesting the energy of ligand binding this energy is
used to boot o the downstream signaling molecules from
the receptor However detailed balance by putting a
constraint on the binding anities of receptor-readout
and receptor-ligand binding then dictates that receptor-
readout binding also inuences receptor-ligand binding
thus perturbing the future signal Indeed the trade-os
faced by equilibrium networks are all dierent manifes-
tations of their time-reversibility The only way for a
time-reversible system to integrate the past is for it to
integrate and hence perturb the future Concomitantly
in a time reversible system there is no sense of up-
stream and downstream concepts which rely on a
direction of time 44 RL is as much a readout of X
as the other way around While in equilibrium systems
the readout encodes the receptor state the readout is
not a stable memory that is decoupled from changes in
the receptor state a change in the state of the readout
induced by readout-receptor unbinding inuences the
future receptor state This introduces cross-correlations
between the intrinsic uctuations in the activation of the
readout modeled by t in Eq 19 and the extrinsic
uctuations in the input RLt KRL cid54 0 It is these
cross-correlations which ultimately arise from time re-
versibility that lead in these equilibrium systems to a
fundamental tradeo between the removal of extrinsic
and intrinsic noise and between increasing the gain and
suppressing the noise
V SENSING IN NON-EQUILIBRIUM SYSTEMS
To beat the sensing limit of equilibrium systems en-
ergy and the receptor need to be employed dierently
Rather than using the energy of ligand binding to change
the state of the readout the system should use fuel This
makes it possible change the readout via chemical mod-
ication with the receptor catalyzing the modication
reaction RL  X  RL  X This decouples receptor-
ligand binding from receptor-readout binding the activa-
tion of the readout does not inuence the future receptor
signal while conversely a change in the receptor state
does not aect the stability of the readout Each readout
molecule that has interacted with the receptor provides
a stable memory collectively the readout molecules en-
code the history of the receptor state This enables the
mechanism of time integration in which the trade-o be-
tween noise and sensitivity is broken and the extrinsic
and intrinsic noise can be reduced simultaneously 21
Catalysts cannot change the chemical equilibrium of
two reactions that are the microscopic reverse of each
other To make the average state of the readout depen-
dent on the average receptor occupancy the activation
reaction RL  X  RL  X must therefore be coupled
to a reaction that is not its microscopic reverse and the
system must be driven out of equilibrium This is pre-
cisely the canonical signaling motif of a receptor driving
a push-pull network In such a network the receptor it-
self or the enzyme associated with it like CheA in E coli
chemotaxis catalyzes the activation of a readout protein
X via chemical modication ie the phosphorylation of
the messenger protein CheY active readout molecules X
can then decay spontaneously or be deactivated by an en-
zyme like the phosphatase CheZ in E coli via a reaction
that is not the microscopic reverse of the activation reac-
tion Typically the activation via chemical modication
is coupled to fuel turnover while deactivation is not in
E coli chemotaxis for example phosphorylation of CheY
is fueled by ATP hydrolysis CheA  ATP  CheY 
CheA  ADP  CheYp while dephosphorylation is not
CheZ  CheYp  CheZ  CheY  Pi Another classical
example is MAPK signaling where activation of MAPK
is driven by ATP hydrolysis while deactivation is not
even though it is typically catalyzed by a phosphatase
In all these systems ATP hydrolysis is used to drive the
readout molecule to a high energy state the active phos-
phorylated state which then relaxes back to the inactive
dephosphorylated state via another pathway setting up
a cycle in state space leading to energy dissipation
A The sensing error
To derive the fundamental resources required for sens-
it is instructive to view the downstream system
as a device that samples the state of the receptor dis-
cretely 20 The activation reaction RL  X  ATP kf
RL  X  ADP assumed to be fueled by ATP hydroly-
sis generates samples of the ligand-binding state of the
receptor by storing the receptor state in the stable mod-
ication states of the readout molecules We expect that
if there are N receptor-readout interactions then the cell
has N samples of the receptor state and the error in the
concentration estimate cc is reduced by a factor of
N  However to derive the eective number of sam-
ples we have to consider not only the creation of sam-
ples but also their decay and reliability The decay reac-
tion X kr X is equivalent to discarding or erasing sam-
ples The microscopically reverse reactions of these acti-
vation and deactivation reactions namely the receptor-
kf X  RL  ATP
mediated deactivation X  RL  ADP
and the spontaneous or phosphatase catalyzed activa-
kr X independent of the receptor generate in-
correct samples of the receptor state Energy is needed
to break time-reversibility and to protect the coding
How the receptor samples are generated erased and
how they are stored in the readout determine the num-
ber of samples their independence and their reliability
which together set the sensing precision 20

This expression has a clear interpretation The relaxation
time r is the eective integration time The quantity n is
the ux of X across the cycle of activation by the receptor
and deactivation The product nr is thus the number
of cycles of read-out molecules involving collisions with
ligand-bound receptor molecules during the integration
time r The quantity nrp is the total number of read-
out cycles involving collisions with receptor molecules be
they ligand bound or not It is thus the total number of
receptor samples taken during r N 
Not all of these samples are reliable The eective
number of samples taken during r is Ne  q N  where

fundamentally limit sensing A fundamental resource or
combination of resources is a collective variable that
when xed puts a lower bound on the sensing error no
matter how the other variables are varied It can be nd
via constraint-based optimization yielding 20

two resources A and B compensate each other one resource
can always be decreased without aecting the sensing error
by increasing the other resource concomitantly increasing a
resource will always reduce the sensing error When both re-
sources are instead fundamental the sensing error is bounded
by the limiting resource and cannot be reduced by increas-
ing the other B C The three classes timereceptor copies
copies of downstream molecules and energy are all required
for sensing with no trade-os among them The minimum
sensing error obtained by minimizing Eq 21 is plotted for dif-
ferent combinations of B XT and w and C RT 1  rc
and w The curves track the bound for the limiting resource
indicated by the grey lines showing that the resources do not
compensate each other The plot for the minimum sensing er-
ror as a function of RT 1  rc and XT is identical to that
of C with w replaced by XT  D The energy requirements
for sensing In the irreversible regime    the work to
take one sample of a ligand-bound receptor wp Ne  equals
 because each sample requires the turnover of one fuel
molecule consuming  of energy In the quasi-equilibrium
regime   0 each eective sample of the bound re-
ceptor requires 4kBT which denes the fundamental lower
bound on the energy requirement for taking a sample When
  0 the network is in equilibrium and both w and N are
0 ATP hydrolysis provides 20kBT showing that phospho-
rylation of read-out molecules makes it possible to store the
receptor state reliably The results are obtained fromEq 22
with 1  2  2 E Sampling more than once per
correlation time requires more resources while the benet is
marginal As the sampling rate is increased by increasing the
readout copy number XT  the number of independent mea-
surements NI saturates at the Berg-Purcell limit RT rc
but the energy and protein cost  XT  continue to rise
This expression identies three fundamental resource
classes each yielding a fundamental sensing limit
RT 1  rc which for the relevant regime of time inte-
gration r  c is RT rc XT  and wr These classes
cannot compensate each other in achieving a desired sens-
ing precision and hence do not trade-o against each
other The sensing precision is like the weakest link in a
chain bounded by the limiting resource as illustrated in
Fig 3A-C However within each class trade-os are pos-
sible We now briey discuss the fundamental resource
classes and their associated sensing limits
Receptors and their integration time RT rc The
number of receptor samples increases with the number
In fact as XT   the
of readout molecules XT 
spacing between the samples   0 and the eective
number of receptor samples N e   this is indeed
the Berg-Purcell mechanism of time integration How-
ever each receptor can take an independent concentra-
tion measurement only every 2c meaning that the num-
ber of independent measurements taken during the inte-
gration time r is per receptor rc the disappear-
ance of the factor 2 is due to the fact that the deacti-
vation of X increases the eective spacing between the
samples see 20 Assuming that the receptors bind
independently but see section VI B the total number
of independent concentration measurements N I  taken
during r is then limited by RT rc no matter how
large XT is Fig 3E This yields the sensing limit of
Berg and Purcell cc2  4RT rc recognizing
that the receptors are assumed to bind independently
and p1  p  025 cf Eq 3 While the product
RT rc is fundamental RT and r are not the error is
determined by the total number of independent concen-
tration measurements and it does not matter whether
these measurements are performed by many receptors
over a short integration time or by one receptor over a
long integration time
The number of readout molecules XT  Each concen-
tration measurement needs to be stored in the chemical
modication state of a readout molecule and XT lim-
its the maximum number of measurements that can be
stored Consequently no matter how many receptors the
cell has or how much time it uses to integrate the recep-
tor state the sensing error is fundamentally limited by
the pool of readout molecules cc2  4XT 
Energy

the rate at which the fuel molecules do work is w  n

receptor molecules that are bound to ligand because
only they can modify X The total number of eective
samples of ligand-bound receptors obtained during r is

cation state of the readout and increasing  further

the quality of the samples q rapidly decreases with de-
creasing  In this regime the system must take multi-
ple noisy receptor samples to give the same information
as one single perfect sample In the limit   0 the
quality factor q  4 and the work to take one ef-
fective sample of a ligand-bound receptor approaches its
minimal value of wpN e   q  4kT  Substitut-
ing this in Eq 21 yields another bound on the sensing
error cc2  4 wr The bound can be reached
when RT rc and XT are not limiting and   0
This bound shows that while the total work w  wr
done during the integration time r is fundamental the
power w and r are not leading to a trade-o between
accuracy speed and power as found in adaptation 45
C Design principle of optimal resource allocation
The observation that resources cannot compensate
each other naturally yields the design principle of opti-
mal resource allocation which states that in an optimally
designed system each resource is equally limiting so that
no resource is in excess and thus wasted Quantitatively
Eq 23 predicts that in an optimally designed system
RT rc  XT  w
In an optimal sensing system the number of independent
concentration measurements RT rc equals the number
of readout molecules XT that store these measurements
and equals the work in units of kBT  to create the sam-
ples Interestingly the authors of Ref
20 found that
the chemotaxis system of E coli obeys the principle of
optimal resource allocation Eq 24 This indicates that
there is a selective pressure on the optimal allocation of
resources in cellular sensing
VI DISCUSSION
A Dierent sensing strategies encode and decode
ligand information dierently
Cells use dierent sensing strategies which dier in
how they process information about the ligand concentra-
tion The data processing inequality 46 guarantees for
any network that no readout X can have more informa-
tion about the ligand concentration encoded in its time
trace than the ligand-bound receptor RL has in its time-
trace 21 IX0T t L  IRL0T t L where I
is the mutual information between the arguments with
L the chemical potential of the ligand and y0T t in-
dicates the time trace of y  X RL from time 0 to time
T  Clearly the accuracy of sensing for any network is
bounded by the amount of information that is in the
time trace of the receptor state However the dierent
sensing strategies dier in how they encode the ligand
concentration in the receptor dynamics and in how they
decode the information that is in the receptor time trace
For equilibrium networks the data processing inequal-
ity guarantees that no readout has more information
about the ligand than the receptors at any given time
21 IXT  L  IRLT  L  log2RT  1 and
therefore the information in the instantaneous level of the
readout is bounded by the total number of receptors RT 
This statement is the information-theoretic analogue of
Eq 20 The history of receptor states does contain more
information about the ligand concentration than the in-
stantaneous receptor state but an equilibrium signaling
network cannot exploit this its output contains no more
information than the instantaneous receptor state
Cells that use the mechanism of time integration can
exploit the information that is the time trace of the re-
ceptor and for these networks IXT  L can be larger
than IRLT  L These cells estimate the ligand con-
centration from the average receptor occupancy over an
integration time which as we have seen in section III
is determined by the architecture of the readout system
and the lifetime of the readout molecules It is quite clear
that cells employ this mechanism of time integration the
central motif of cell signaling in both prokaryotes and
eukaryotes the push-pull network implements time av-
eraging by storing the receptor state into stable chemical
modication states of the readout molecules which col-
lectively encode the average receptor occupancy over the
past integration time
Another sensing strategy is maximum likelihood es-
timation 12 14 22
It estimates the ligand concen-
tration not from the average receptor occupancy over
the integration time T  as in the mechanism of time
integration but rather from the mean duration of the
unbound state of the receptor u cMLE  1ukon
The sensing error of this strategy for a single recep-
MLE  1konc1  pT  12 which is half
tor is cc2
that of the mechanism of time integration see Eq 16
The reason why this sensing strategy is more accurate
is that only the binding rate depends on the concentra-
tion not the unbinding rate Hence only the unbound
interval provides information on the concentration
contrast the mechanism of time integration infers the
concentration from the mean receptor occupancy which
depends on both the unbound interval and the uninfor-
mative bound interval
How cells could actually implement the strategy of
maximum-likelihood estimation remains an open ques-
tion One possibility is that receptors are internal-
ized upon ligand binding another that they bind ligand
only briey and signal only transiently which could be
achieved via receptor adaptation or desensitization fol-
lowing ligand binding 12 Another intriguing possibil-
ity has recently been suggested by Lang et al
22 It
is inspired by the observation that many receptors such
as receptor-tyrosine kinases and G-protein coupled re-
ceptors are chemically modied via fuel turnover 22
In this scheme the cell estimates the ligand concentra-
tion from the average receptor occupancy over an inte-
gration time T  as in the canonical mechanism of time
integration However upon ligand binding the receptor
is driven via fuel turnover through a non-equilibrium cy-
cle of m chemical modication steps before it can release
and bind new ligand again In the limit that the energy
drop over the cycle    and m   the sensing
accuracy approaches the maximum-likelihood-estimation
limit even though the concentration is inferred from the
average receptor occupancy The reason is that in this
limit the interval distribution of the active receptor state
becomes a delta function instead of an exponential one
as in the case of canonical time integration This elimi-
nates the noise from the uninformative bound interval in
estimating the average receptor occupancy
B The importance of spatio-temporal correlations
Ultimately the precision of sensing via a mechanism
that relies on integrating the receptor state be it the
canonical Berg-Purcell scheme with Markovian active re-
ceptor states or the maximum-likelihood scheme of Lang
et al with non-Markovian active states 22 is deter-
mined by the number of receptors the receptor corre-
lation time and how the readout molecules sample the
receptor molecules The analysis of Ref 20 ignores any
spatio-temporal correlations of both the ligand molecules
and the readout molecules In this analysis the dier-
ent receptor molecules bind the ligand molecules inde-
pendently and the correlation time of the receptor clus-
ter is that of a single receptor molecule c The to-
tal number of independent concentration measurements
in the integration time T is then the number of re-
ceptors RT times the number of independent measure-
ments per receptor T c yielding the fundamental limit
cc2  2cp1  pRT T  Importantly because c
is independent of the number of receptors the sensing
error decreases with the number of receptors However
diusion introduces spatio-temporal correlations between
the dierent ligand-receptor binding events 3 9 10 24
Consequently the correlation time N of RT receptors on
a spherical cell of radius R is not that of a single receptor
molecule but is rather given by 24
kac  kd
ka kac  RT kd
4DR kac  kd2 
As pointed out by Wang et al 10 the correlation time
N increases with the number of receptors RT and even
diverges for RT   which means that when RT is
large andor the integration time T is short the mecha-
nism of time integration breaks down In this regime the
equilibrium sensing strategy is superior because it relies
on sensing the instantaneous receptor state 10 Using
receptors that bind ligand non-cooperatively as the read-
RL  1p1  pRT  which indeed

decreases with RT 10 21

For large RT but not so large that N  T  the sensing
error reduces to cid18 c
cid192
2DRcT
This apart from the factor 1  p is the classical result
of Berg and Purcell 3 9 At suciently large RT  the
sensing error is limited by diusion the size of the cell
and the integration time It becomes independent of RT 
because the decrease of the instantaneous error with RT 
1RT p1  p is cancelled by the increase of the cor-
relation time with RT 
Not only in the encoding of the ligand concentration
in the receptor dynamics but also in the decoding of this
information by the readout system spatio-temporal cor-
relations can become important Receptor and readout
molecules are often spatially partitioned due eg to the
underlying cytoskeletal network or lipid rafts Even in a
system that is spatially homogeneous on average spatio-
temporal partitioning would occur because of the nite
speed of diusion We have recently shown that this par-
titioning decreases the propagation of noise essentially
because the activation of the dierent readout molecules
becomes less correlated 47 Whether there exists an
optimal diusion constant of the readout molecules that
matches the correlation length and time of the receptors
which is set by the ligand diusion and binding dynamics
is an intriguing question for future work
C Cooperative receptor activation
One important aspect that we have not addressed so
far is the role of receptor cooperativity It is now well es-
tablished that receptors are often activated cooperatively
with the most studied and best characterized example be-
ing the receptor cluster of the E coli chemotaxis system
How does this aect the precision of sensing This de-
pends again on the receptor correlation time 18 Skoge
et al found that while cooperative interactions between
neighboring receptors can increase the gain which re-
duces the sensing error they also increase the correla-
tion time such that independent receptors are in fact
optimal As we now know equilibrium systems do not
rely on time integration and hence do not suer from a
slowing down of the receptor dynamics In fact we have
shown that for all equilibrium systems in which the recep-
X  1RT 
tors bind the ligand non-cooperatively cc2
hence to reach the bound of Eq 20 for all equilibrium
networks cooperative ligand binding is necessary 21
In 21 we show that cooperative ligand binding makes it
indeed possible to beat the non-cooperative bound but
whether equilibrium sensing systems can actually reach
the bound of Eq 20 remains an open question
D The role of energy in sensing
It seems intuitively clear that fuel turnover can be used
to enhance the precision of sensing but how it can be
used is less obvious In the maximum-likelihood scheme
of Lang et al it is used to make the interval-distribution
of the active receptor state more deterministic 22 In
the scheme of time integration fuel turnover is used to
sample the receptor state 16 20
The latter example seems tantalisingly related to the
thermodynamics of computation formulated by Bennett
and Landauer decades ago 25 26
In particular the
receptor state appears to be copied into the chemical
modication states of readout molecules which thereby
acts as memory elements for time integration 16 20
Performing copy operations repeatedly using the same
readout requires net work input unless the correlation
between the data bit receptor and the memory read-
out generated by the copy operation is used to extract
work 27 Indeed the arguments of Landauer and Ben-
nett 25 26 show that the minimal amount of work for a
perfect copy cycle is kBT ln2 But how does this bound
apply to biochemical networks
To answer this question it is important to make a for-
mal mapping between cellular sensing systems and copy
operations As it turns out cellular copy protocols dif-
fer fundamentally from ideal quasi-static protocols such
as those considered by Landauer and Bennett 25 26
Copying entails changing the state of the memory which
means that a thermodynamic driving force must be ap-
plied to the system Thermodynamically optimal pro-
tocols increase the driving force slowly such that the
memory is slowly driven to its new state In contrast in
cellular systems the thermodynamic driving force for the
reactions that implement the copy process is typically
constant because the fuel molecules that drive these re-
actions are commonly present at constant concentration
27 As a result cellular systems face a trade-o between
cost and precision that is both qualitatively and quanti-
tatively distinct from that required thermodynamically
regardless of parameters 27 They dissipate more to
achieve the same accuracy One of the most vivid man-
ifestations of this dierence concerns the Landauer limit
itself One of the surprising but by now well-known re-
sults of Bennett and Landauer was that quasi-static pro-
tocols make it possible to perform repeated copies with
100 accuracy at only a nite energy cost of indeed
kBT ln2 per copy In contrast cellular copy protocols
can only reach 100 accuracy when the cost diverges
For the purpose of sampling a noisy signal however
perfect copies are not necessarily ideal
Indeed as we
have seen in section V B the energetically most ecient
approach to record the receptor state is to take many
noisy samples which together make up one eective sam-
ple For the canonical push-pull network considered here
the minimal cost to take one eective receptor sample is
2kBT on average if the receptor occupancy is p  05 20
For a bi-functional kinase system in which the kinase as-
sociated with the receptor catalyzes the phosphorylation
of the readout when the receptor is bound to ligand but
dephosphorylation when the receptor is not bound to lig-
and this minimal cost is even lower 1kBT 27
E How resources determine the fundamental
sensing limit Trade-os between equilibrium and
non-equilibrium sensing
Information processing devices require resources to be
built and run Components are needed to construct the
system space is required to accommodate the compo-
nents and energy is required to make the components and
operate the system These resources constrain the design
and performance of any device and cellular sensing sys-
tems are no exception Making proteins is costly 48
They also take up valuable space both the membrane
and the cytoplasm are highly crowded with proteins oc-
cupying 2575 of the membrane area 49 and 2030 of
the cytoplasmic volume 50 And many cellular signaling
pathways including two-component systems in bacteria
51 GTP-ase cycles as in the Ras system 52 phos-
phorylation cycles as in MAPK cascades 53 are driven
out of thermal equilibrium via the turnover of fuel Also
the adaptation system that allows E coli to adapt to a
wide range of background concentrations is driven out of
strategies selected because of dierent resource selection
pressures
It is tempting to believe that when sensing
precision is important but space for receptors on the
membrane is limiting non-equilibrium sensing becomes
essential because it makes it possible to take more con-
centration measurements per receptor
VII CONCLUSION
In this review we have focused on sensing concentra-
tions that do not vary on the timescale of the response
of the system While some questions remain open such
as the importance of spatio-temporal correlations in both
ligand-receptor and receptor-readout binding this prob-
lem is by now fairly well understood We understand how
the receptor correlation time depends on the diusion
and binding kinetics of the ligand although the question
of the correlation time of multiple receptors is arguably
still open how the eective integration time depends on
the lifetime of the readout molecules and the architec-
ture of the readout network and how the precision of
sensing depends on the number of receptors the number
of readout molecules the receptor correlation time the
integration time and energy We understand how com-
binations of resources impose fundamental sensing limits
and what this implies for the optimal design of cellular
sensing systems
The challenge will be to make a similar leap for sys-
tems that do not respond rapidly on the timescale of vari-
ations in the input signal For these systems we have to
take the dynamics of the input signal into account On
this front progress has been made in recent years We
are now beginning to understand how in these systems
information transmission depends on the lifetime of the
readout molecules and on the topology of the readout
network 5558 and what the trade-o between energy
dissipation and information processing is 5962 Yet
many questions are still wide open What is the perfor-
mance measure that best descibres the design logic of
cellular sensing systems Is it the average sensing error
the instantaneous mutual information the information
transmission rate 55 or the learning rate 60 61 What
resource combinations impose fundamental sensing lim-
its Also new questions arise How accurately can living
cells predict the future input signal 63 And what are
the thermodynamic costs of cellular prediction 63 64
The physics of sensing will remain a fascinating problem
for many years to come

FIG 4
Cells face a fundamental trade-o between two
modes of sensing an equilibrium mode based on binding and
sequestration and a non-equilibrium mode based on catalysis
These sensing strategies have dierent resource requirements
equilibrium 45 However cells also commonly employ
equilibrium motifs such as protein binding and seques-
tration Indeed as we have seen sensing does not funda-
mentally require energy input 21 Equilibrium sensing
systems can respond to changes in the environment by
harvesting the energy of ligand binding thereby capital-
izing on the work that is performed by the environment
to change the ligand concentration Also adaptation does
not fundamentally require energy consumption 54
When does the non-equilibrium sensing strategy out-
perform the equilibrium one This depends on the re-
sources available to the cell as summarized in Fig 4
Comparing the bound for non-equilibrium systems
Eq 23 with that for equilibrium ones without coop-
erative binding cc2  1RT  predicts that non-
equilibrium systems can sense more accurately when
there is at least one readout molecule available per re-
ceptor and the amount of energy dissipated per receptor
during the integration time is at least 1kBT 21
Interestingly evolution may have toggled between
equilibrium and non-equilibrium sensing strategies Bac-
teria employ both one- and two-component signaling net-
works One-component systems follow the equilibrium
strategy consisting of adaptor proteins which can bind
an upstream ligand and a downstream eector Two-
component systems are similar to the non-equilibrium
push-pull system considered here consisting of a kinase
receptor and its substrate Intriguingly some adaptor
proteins like RocR contain the same-ligand binding do-
main as the kinase and the same eector-binding domain
as the substrate of a two-component system ie NtrB-
NtrC 41 They could thus transmit the same signal
Our results suggest that these are alternative signaling
