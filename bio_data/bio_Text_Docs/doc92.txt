The adhesion of cells is mediated by receptors and ligands anchored in apposing membranes A cen-
tral question is how to characterize the binding afnity of these membrane-anchored molecules For soluble
molecules the binding afnity is typically quantied by the binding equilibrium constant K3D in the linear rela-
tion RL  K3DRL between the volume concentration RL of bound complexes and the volume concen-
trations R and L of unbound molecules For membrane-anchored molecules it is often assumed by analogy
that the area concentration of bound complexes RL is proportional to the product RL of the area concen-
trations for the unbound receptor and ligand molecules We show here i that this analogy is only valid for
two planar membranes immobilized on rigid surfaces and ii that the thermal roughness of exible membranes
leads to cooperative binding of receptors and ligands In the case of exible membranes the area concentration
RL of receptor-ligand bonds is proportional to R2L2 for typical lengths and concentrations of receptors
and ligands in cell adhesion zones The cooperative binding helps to understand why different experimental
methods for measuring the binding afnity of membrane-anchored molecules have led to values differing by
several orders of magnitude
INTRODUCTION
Cell adhesion processes are essential for the distinction of
self and foreign in immune responses the formation of tis-
sues or the signal transduction across the synaptic cleft of
neurons 1 The adhesion processes are mediated by the spe-
cic binding of receptor and ligand proteins anchored in the
cell membranes Because of the importance of these pro-
cesses the binding of cells to other cells or to supported
lipid membranes with anchored ligand molecules has been
studied intensively with a variety of experimental methods
2 3 4 5 6
In addition theoretical models 7 8 9
10 11 12 13 14 15 16 and experiments on lipid vesi-
cles with membrane-anchored receptor and ligand molecules
17 18 19 aim to mimic and capture the specic membrane
binding processes leading to cell adhesion
A central question is how to characterize and measure the
binding afnity of the membrane-anchored receptor and lig-
and molecules that are involved in cell adhesion The binding
afnity of soluble receptor and ligand molecules can be char-
acterized by the binding equilibrium constant K3D dened by
RL3D  K3DR3DL3D
where RL3D is the volume concentration of bound receptor-
ligand complexes and R3D and L3D are the volume con-
centrations of unbound receptors and unbound ligands in the
solution The equilibrium constant K3D is determined by the
binding free energy of the complex and can be measured with
standard experimental methods 20 21 22 An often consid-
ered two-dimensional analogue for membrane receptors and
ligands is the quantity
K2D  RL
where RL R and L now are the area concentrations of
bound receptor-ligand complexes unbound receptors and un-
bound ligands 23 24 25 Since the dimensions of K2D and
K3D are area and volume respectively Bell and coworkers
7 26 suggested that K2D can be estimated as K3D  lc where
lc is a suitably chosen connement length and K3D is the
equilibrium constant of soluble counterparts of the membrane
receptors and ligands obtained by cleaving the membrane an-
chors The binding afnity of membrane-anchored receptors
and ligands have also been directly investigated with uo-
rescence recovery after photobleaching 24 27 28 29 30
and with several mechanical methods 24 involving mi-
cropipettes 25 31 32 hydrodynamic ow chambers 2 33
the surface force apparatus 34 or the biomembrane force
probe 35 36 However as pointed out by Dustin and
coworkers 24 the K2D values obtained from uorescence
recovery after photobleaching differ by several orders of mag-
nitude from values measured with mechanical methods
Quantifying the afnity of membrane-anchored receptor
and ligand molecules is complicated by the fact that the bind-
ing process depends on the local separation and thus the
conformations of the two apposing membranes We consider
here a statistical-mechanical model of membrane adhesion in
which the membranes are described as discretized elastic sur-
faces and the adhesion proteins as individual molecules dif-
fusing on these surfaces We nd that thermal shape uctua-
tions of the elastic membranes lead to cooperative binding of
receptors and ligands The relevant thermal uctuations occur
on length scales up to the average separation of the receptor-
ligand bonds which is around 100 nm for typical bond con-
centrations in cell adhesion zones 3 On these length scales
the shape uctuations are dominated by the bending rigidity
of the membranes In our model the binding cooperativity
leads to the quadratic dependence

and L of free receptors and ligands Here c cid39 13 is a dimen-
sionless prefactor   121  2 is the effective bend-
ing rigidity of the two apposing membranes with rigidities 1

the interaction range of the receptor-ligand bonds and Kpl is
the two-dimensional equilibrium constant in the case of two
apposing planar supported membranes within binding sepa-
ration of the receptor-ligand bonds The binding cooperativity
results from the fact that an increase in the bond concentration
RL smoothens out the membranes which facilitates the
binding of additional receptor and ligand molecules Eq 3
holds for typical concentrations and lengths of receptors and
ligands in cell adhesion zones The equation implies that K2D
dened in eq 2 is not constant but depends on the receptor
and ligand concentration which helps to understand why u-
orescence recovery and mechanical methods to measure this
quantity can lead to signicantly different results see section
II MODELING BIOMEMBRANE ADHESION
A Membrane elasticity
In our model the membranes are described as discretized
elastic surfaces Each patch of the discretized membranes
has an area a2 and can contain one receptor or one ligand
molecule 37 Molecular models of membranes indicate that
the whole spectrum of bending deformations is captured if the
linear patch size a is around 5 nm 38
sion dominates over the bending energy on length scales larger
The elasticity of lipid membranes in general depends on the
bending rigidity  39 and the tension  An important length
scale is the crossover lengthcid112 40 The membrane ten-
thancid112 while the bending energy dominates on smaller
a few Jm 42 the crossover lengthcid112 attains values
length scales For typical values of the bending rigidity  of
lipid bilayers around 1019 J cid39 25 kBT 41 and tensions of
of several hundred nanometers In addition the elasticity of
cell membranes is affected by the actin cytoskeleton on length
scales larger than the distance of the cytoskeletal membrane
anchors which is around 100 nm 1
In cell or membrane adhesion zones the relevant shape
uctuations occur on length scales up to the average distance
of the receptor-ligand bonds since the bonds locally constrain
the two membranes Typical values for the average bond dis-
tance in cell adhesion zones range from 50 to 100 nm 3
which is signicantly smaller than the crossover lengthcid112
estimated above and smaller than or equal to the distance of
the cytoskeletal membrane anchors The relevant shape uctu-
ations in the adhesion zones on length scales up to the average
bond distance are therefore dominated by the bending energy
In our model the bending energy has the form 37

ties 1 and 2 If one of the membranes eg membrane 2
is a planar supported membrane the effective bending rigid-
ity  equals the rigidity 1 of the apposing membrane since

B Receptor-ligand interactions
We consider here a membrane with a single type of receptor
molecules apposing a second membrane with complementary
ligands see g 1a A receptor can bind to a ligand molecule
in our model i if the ligand is located in the membrane patch
apposing the receptor and ii if the membrane separation li is
close to the length lo of the receptor-ligand bond For simplic-
ity we describe the receptor-ligand interaction by the square-
well potential

where U  0 is the binding energy and lwe the binding range
of a receptor-ligand complex The binding range is the dif-
ference between the smallest and the largest local membrane
separation at which the molecules can bind The binding
range lwe depends on the interaction range of the two bind-

our model the attractive interactions between the receptor and lig-
and molecules lead to an effective single-well adhesion potential Vef

III EFFECTIVE ADHESION POTENTIAL OF THE
MEMBRANES
The equilibrium properties of our model can be derived
from the free energy F  kBT lnZ where Z is the par-
tition function kB is Boltzmanns constant and T is the tem-
perature The partition function Z is the sum over all possible
membrane congurations with each conguration l n m
weighted by the Boltzmann factor exp Hl n mkBT 
In our model the partial summation in Z over all possible
distributions m and n of receptors and ligands can be per-
formed exactly which leads to an effective adhesion poten-
tial see appendix A The effective adhesion potential of the
membranes is again a square-well potential of the form 5
with the same binding range lwe as the receptor-ligand inter-
action but with an effective potential depth Uef that depends
on the concentrations and binding energy U of receptors and
ligands see g 1b The concentrations of receptors and lig-
ands in biological or biomimetic membranes are several or-
ders of magnitude smaller than the maximum concentration

size a cid39 5 nm For these small concentrations the effective
potential depth is

as shown in the appendix The equilibrium behavior of our
model thus can be determined from considering two lipid
membranes interacting via an effective adhesion potential

IV MEMBRANE FRACTION WITHIN BINDING RANGE
OF RECEPTORS AND LIGANDS
A receptor molecule can only bind an apposing ligand
molecule if the local membrane separation is comparable to
the length of the receptor-ligand complex A central quantity
in our model therefore is the fraction Pb of apposing mem-
brane patches i with a separation li within the binding range
lo  lwe2 of the receptor-ligand interaction 5 Our goal is
to determine the equilibrium concentration RL of receptor-
ligand bonds We nd that this concentration is proportional
to Pb and proportional to the concentrations R and L of
unbound receptor and ligand molecules and given by
RL  Pb RL a2eUkB T 
see appendix The quantity a2eUkB T in this equation can be
understood from considering rst two planar parallel mem-
branes supported on rigid substrates eg two supported mem-
branes in the surface force apparatus 34 43 If the separation
of the two membranes is close to the length lo of the receptor-
ligand complex we have Pb  1 A comparison with eq 1
FIG 2 The roughness of the membranes decreases with increas-
ing concentration of receptor-ligand bonds top to bottom since
the bonds constrain membrane shape uctuations The fraction Pb
of membrane segments within binding separation of the receptors
and ligands therefore increases with the bond concentration see
eq 14 which leads to binding cooperativity The binding of re-
ceptors and ligands smoothens out the membranes and thus facil-
itates the formation of additional receptor-ligand bonds For clarity
unbound receptor and ligand molecules are omitted in the cartoons
abcthen indicates that the quantity
Kpl  a2eUkB T
can be interpreted as the two-dimensional binding equilibrium
constant of the receptors and ligands in the case of planar
membranes with separation lo If we now use the denition
2 for K2D we obtain
K2D  PbKpl
However thermal shape uctuations of exible membranes
not supported on rigid substrates can lead to values of Pb
much smaller than 1 We will show here that Pb depends on
the concentrations of the receptors and ligands which results
in cooperative binding see g 2 As an equilibrium quantity
the area fraction Pb of the membranes within receptor-ligand
binding range is determined by the effective adhesion poten-
tial shown in g 1b
V LONG RECEPTOR-LIGAND COMPLEXES
We consider rst the case in which the length of the
receptor-ligand complexes is larger than the thermal mem-
brane roughness The uctuating membranes then do not
touch each other and the repulsive hard-wall interaction of
the lipid membranes can be neglected We will show in the
next section that this case applies to biological receptor-ligand
complexes with typical lengths between 15 and 40 nm 44
which are much larger than the binding range lwe of the re-
ceptor and ligand molecules Scaling arguments indicate that
the central parameter that affects Pb is the rescaled effective
potential depth 45

in the case of long receptor-ligand complexes The fraction
Pb  Pbu of membrane patches with a separation within

of a single parameter u in this case
A Linear regime
For relatively small values of the rescaled effective potential
depth u the membrane fraction Pb within binding range of the
receptors and ligands is linear in u and behaves as

The numerical prefactor c  13  1 in this equation can be

and thus a linear dependence of Pb on the concentrations R
and L of unbound receptors and ligands Our central result

wekBT 2 is the rescaled effective
potential depth which is the central parameter governing Pb in this
case The Monte Carlo data points are well tted by the function

t parameters c1 cid39 0070 c2 cid39 032 and c3 cid39 050 see full

can be described by Pb cid39 uc1  u with the single t parame-
ter c1 cid39 0071 This single-parameter function is also a reasonable
approximation over the whole range of Pb values see dashed line
The linear relation 12 results from an expansion of this function for
small values of u
The linear behavior 12 does in fact hold for a wide bio-
logically relevant range of concentrations and bending rigidi-
ties To see this we consider the relation
Pb cid112ckBT l2
obtained from eq 12 and Uef  kBT RLPb which fol-
lows from eqs 7 and 8 The linear relation 12 is valid
for small Pb cid46 02 see g 3 Typical bond concentrations in
cell adhesion zones are around RL  100m2 3 while
the binding range of receptor and ligand proteins can be esti-
mated as lwe  1 nm Typical values for the bending rigidities
of lipid bilayers are around 25 kBT 41 which implies an
effective rigidity  of 125kBT for two apposing membranes
see text below eq 4 Because of its embedded and attached
proteins the bending rigidities of biological membranes may
be larger eg by a factor 2 For the effective rigidity of lipid
bilayers we obtain the estimate Pb cid39 013 from eq 14 and
for a 2-fold increased effective rigidity we obtain Pb cid39 019
Both estimates are within the range of Pb values for which the
linear relation 12 is valid
B Nonlinear regime
Our model is not limited to the linear regime considered in
the previous section The full functional dependence of Pb on
the rescaled effective potential depth u dened in eq 11 can
be determined from Monte Carlo simulations see g 3 The

VI SHORT RECEPTOR-LIGAND COMPLEXES
Lipid vesicles with anchored receptor molecules are im-
portant biomimetic systems for cell adhesion In these sys-
tems the receptors either bind to ligands anchored in other
vesicles 18 or to ligands anchored in supported membranes
17 19 In principle the length of the receptor and ligand
molecules in these systems can be varied For short receptor-
ligand complexes the hard-wall interaction of the lipid mem-
branes is an important aspect of adhesion The hard-wall in-
teraction leads to an entropic uctuation-induced repulsion of
the membranes 46 and to an unbinding transition at a nite
strength of the attractive interactions between the receptors
and ligands 47 In our model the strength of these attractive
interactions is captured by the depth Uef of the effective ad-
hesion potential shown in g 1 In the interplay between en-
tropic repulsion and attractive receptor-ligand interactions the
membranes will be bound for potential depths Uef  Uc where
Uc is the critical interaction strength of the binding transition
The membranes are unbound for potential depths Uef  Uc
The critical potential depth Uc depends i on the width lwe
of the potential well which is identical with the binding range
of the receptor-ligand interaction 5 and ii on the separation
l1 of the potential well from the hard wall see g 1b For
l1  lwe we have previously obtained the relation
Uc  bkBT 2
 l1lwe
from scaling arguments and Monte Carlo simulations with the
numerical prefactor b  0025  0002 45 With increasing
l1 the critical potential depth Uc goes to zero since the effect
of the entropic repulsion decreases
In the bound state of the membranes with Uef  Uc the
membrane fraction Pb within binding range of the receptors
and ligands increases with increasing values of Uef see g 4
As in the previous section we consider here rst the linear
regime for values of Uef close to Uc We nd that eq 12

effective potential well shown in g 1b and l1 is the separation of
this well from the hard wall at l  0 where the two lipid membranes
are in contact The Monte Carlo data for lwel1  0 are the data
shown in g 3 The full line interpolating these data is the three-
parameter t function given in the caption of g 3 The dashed lines
are quadratic ts to extrapolate the data for lwel1  05 1 and 2 to
Pb  0 From these ts we obtain the following estimates for the

of P cid48

tact zones range from 15 to 40 nanometers 44 For these

rors of the parameters b c and d at these values of l1 and lwe
which implies that the hard-wall interaction is negligible for

therefore is negligible and the average separation cid104licid105 of the
membranes is equal to the length lo of the receptor-ligand

VII DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have shown here that a central quantity in cell adhe-
sion is the fraction of the apposing membranes within bind-
ing range of receptors and ligands In equilibrium the aver-
age separation of two membrane segments bound by receptor-
ligand complexes is equal to the length of the complexes pro-
vided that the steric repulsion of the lipid membranes and
other repulsive interactions eg from large glycoproteins are
negligible The fraction Pb of membrane patches with a sep-
aration within the receptor-ligand binding range then depends
on the thermal roughness of the membranes which in turn is
affected by the concentrations of the receptors and ligands
For small concentrations of receptors and ligands the fraction
Pb of the membranes within binding range is proportional to
RL see eq 13 Since we have RL  PbRLKpl ac-
cording to eq 8 this proportionality leads to the quadratic
dependence 3 of the bond concentration RL on the concen-
trations R and L of free receptors and ligands which indi-
cates cooperative binding The linear relation 13 between
Pb and RL is valid for small Pb cid46 02 The more general
relation 15 which is a good approximation over the whole
range of Pb values leads to eq 16
Our results may help to understand why experimental val-
ues for K2D dened in eq 2 obtained with the uorescence
recovery method are several orders of magnitude larger than
the values obtained with the micropipette method 24 In u-
orescence recovery experiments K2D is measured in the equi-
librated contact zone of a cell adhering to a supported mem-
brane with uorescently labeled ligands In micropipette ex-
periments in contrast K2D is measured for initial contacts be-
tween two cells Dustin and coworkers 24 have pointed out
that the different orders of magnitude of K2D obtained with
these two methods can be partly understood from different
contact areas In the micropipette experiments large mem-
brane protrusions such as microvilli may lead to an actual con-
tact area Ac that is only a few percent of the observed contact
area However even correcting for a signicantly smaller ac-
tual contact area Ac in the micropipette experiments still leads
to values of K2D that are 3 to 4 orders of magnitude smaller
than the K2D values from uorescence recovery experiments
see g 2 in ref 24
We suggest that this orders-of-magnitude gap can be fur-
ther closed by considering PbAc as the relevant quantity for
receptor-ligand binding rather than Ac The quantity PbAc
is the fraction of the actual contact area Ac in which the
two membranes are within binding separation of the receptor-
ligand bonds Since the number of receptor-ligand bonds is
proportional to PbAc differences in this quantity in experi-
mental setups translate directly into differences in K2D see
eq 10 There are two signicant differences between the u-
orescence recovery and the micropipette experiments First in
the equilibrated contact zones of the uorescence recovery ex-
periments the bond concentration RL is enriched compared
to the bond concentration for initial cell contacts probed in the
micropipette experiments This enrichment results from a dif-
fusion of free receptor and ligand molecules into the contact
zone in which the molecules can bind According to eq 14
an increase in RL by a factor of 100 which is not unrealis-
tic 3 leads to an increase in Pb by a factor of 10 and thus
explains one order of magnitude in the observed difference of
K2D values from uorescence recovery and micropipette ex-
periments Second the average separation of cell membrane
and supported membrane in the uorescence recovery experi-
ments is close to the length of the receptor-ligand complexes
For the initial cell-cell contacts in the micropipette experi-
ments in contrast the average separation of the membranes
will deviate from the length of the receptor-ligand complexes
eg because of large glycoproteins that eventually will diffuse
out of the contact zone The effect of this deviation of the
average membrane separation on Pb is more difcult to as-
sess but may easily account for an additional 1 or 2 orders
of magnitude difference in PbAc between uorescence recov-
ery and micropipette experiments The membrane fraction Pb
within binding range depends sensitively i on the thermal
membrane roughness and ii on the difference between the
average membrane separation and the length of the receptor-
ligand complexes Pb is small if the difference between av-
erage membrane separation and complex length exceeds the
thermal membrane roughness which also leads to small val-
ues of K2D see eq 10
We have made several simplifying assumptions in our
model One of these simplications is the square-well form
5 for the receptor-ligand interaction A convenient aspect of
the square-well interaction is that the effective adhesion po-
tential of the membranes which results from an integration
over the receptor and ligand degrees of freedom in the parti-
tion function has the same square-well form with an effective
depth Uef that depends on the concentrations and on the equi-
librium constant Kpl of the receptors and ligands in the case
of planar membranes see eqs 7 and 9 However the effec-
tive potential can also be calculated for other functional forms
of the receptor-ligand interaction eg for a Gaussian form In
general two important parameters of the receptor-ligand inter-
action are the width lwe and depth U of the potential well The
width lwe is affected by the interaction range of the binding
sites on the receptors and ligands by the exibility of these
molecules and by the membrane anchoring while the depth
U is directly related to the equilibrium constant Kpl for pla-
nar membranes see eq 9 We expect that the square-well
potential 5 and other functional forms of the receptor-ligand
interaction lead to rather similar results for comparable values
of the width and depth of the potential wells
We have argued in section II A that the elasticity of cell
membranes is dominated by their bending rigidity on the
length scales up to 100 nm relevant here For typical tensions
 of the membranes the crossover lengthcid112 above which
the tension dominates over the bending energy is clearly
larger see section II A However these length scales are only
slightly smaller or comparable to the average separation of
the cytoskeletal anchors in cell membranes On the one hand
the anchoring to the cytoskeleton may suppress thermal uc-
tuations on length scales larger than the average separation
of the anchors On the other hand active processes within
the cytoskeleton may increase membrane shape uctuations
49 50 In general active cell processes and inhomogeneities
may perturb the homogeneous equilibrium situation consid-
ered here However our results are still applicable to mem-
brane regions in which the concentrations of bound and un-
bound receptors and ligands are locally equilibrated In prin-
ciple vesicles and supported membranes with anchored re-
ceptors and ligands are excellent model systems to test our
theoretical results without the complications of the cell cy-
toskeleton and of active biological processes
APPENDIX A EFFECTIVE ADHESION POTENTIAL
In this appendix we derive the effective potential shown in
g 1b We perform the calculations in the grand-canonical
ensemble in which the concentrations of receptors and ligands
are adjusted by the chemical potentials R and L The chem-
ical potentials are free energy differences between a patch of
size a2 of our discretized membranes that contains a receptor
or ligand molecule and a membrane patch without receptor or
