Many complex systems use networks as their backbone   Complex Network is a more effective method to describe 
                                                 
ABSTRACT 
Motivation  In this paper we present an immune model with bipartite graphs theory We collect data through 
COPE database and construct an immune cytokine network  The act degree distribution of   this network is 
proved to be power-lawwith index of 18 The network is scale-free with  assortativity of 027 and similarity of 
013 The results show that this model could describe the cytokine-cytokine interaction preferably The basic 
attributes of this network is well consistent to our preknowledge of immune system 
Introduction   
complex systems In particular in biological systems studies it is increasingly recognized the role played by the 
topology of cellular networks the intricate web of interaction among genes proteins and other molecules regulating 
cell activity in unveiling the function and the evolution of living organismsJeong et al 2000 Wagner and Fell 2001

descriptions on immune system IS IS is the most important defense system to resist human pathogens This system 
consists of immune organs immune cells and immune molecules Each cell plays an important role in immune system 
The function of many cells in immune system mediated by a group of protein is called cytokines Cytokines are rapidly 
produced by immune cells in response to tissue injury infection or inflammation The overproduction of cytokines 
mediates tissue damage and physiological and molecular mechanisms have evolved to control their production and to 
prevent the injury during the host response In addition to regulate cellular interactions cytokines are the molecular 
players that signal the brain to respond to the danger of viruses bacteria fungi and parasites through an elaborated 
coordination67 So we have necessary to find some important immune cells and cytokines  
1-5  It is interesting to investigate the network 
Although many details of cytokine interactions have been elucidated and the effects of cytokines on a myriad of 
cellular functions have been described 8 practically nothing is known about the network topological structure of the 
system as a whole   All cytokine interaction exhibit nonlinear behaviors9 In fact they act in a complex intermingled 
network where one cytokine can influence the production of and response to many other cytokines So we believe that 
IS should be more effectively described by complex network 
In this paper we suggest an immune model with complex network theory 1011 The paper is organized as follows   
In section two we shall present our model and method   In section three we shall present some results In the last 
section we make a conclusion   
  METHODS 
Other authors have modeled the immune system with a variety of approaches and areas of emphasis 712 But many 
essential features of this complex system are still not understood PTieri has presented a method to quantifying the 
relevance of different mediators in the human immune cell network He draw the cumulative relevance distribution of 
  We collect immune data through 
the immune weighted network  which followed power- law with index of 28 
COPE database and built an immune cytokine network 
11     Bipartite network 
Here we use bipartite graphs to built our network Bipartite network is a graph which connects two distinct sets or 
partitions of nodes which we will refer to as the top and the bottom set An edge in the network runs between a pair of 
a top and a bottom node but never between a pair of top or a pair of bottom nodes 13 see Fig1 Typical examples of 
this type of networks include collaboration networks 14 Such as the movie-actor article-author and board-director 
network In the movie-actor network for instance the movies and actors are the elements of the top and the bottom set 
respectively and an edge between an actor a and a movie m indicates that a has acted in m The actors a and   
a are collaborators if both have participated in the same movie ie if both are connected to the same node    m
13 The concept of collaboration can be extended to include so diverse phenomena represented by bipartite 
networks as the city people network in which an edge between a person and a city indicates that the person has visited 
that particular city the word-sentence 1516 bank-company 17 or donor-acceptor network which accounts for injection 
and merging of magnetic field  lines 1819 
As described above is the bipartite network on the knowledge  Next we used the method of     bipartite network to 
build our immune system Because the immune system we discuss in this paper have two distinct sets of nodes the 
edges between the top nodes and the bottom nodes in our immune system indicates secretion relation

12 Our   immune network  
The immune bipartite network we consider is constituted by two kinds of nodes one is immune cell types the other 
is mediators  In this view the mediators s role is uniquely one element in a network of mediators interaction We 
consider these immune cells   mediated by soluble molecules such as cytokines chemokines hormones In the immune 
system model we construct with 44 top nodes 1640 bottom nodes 5391 links We can also considered top nodes and 
bottom nodes respectively as act and actor These data are small compared to other bipartite networks such as the 
Hollywood actors collaboration network and scientists  collaboration network but it represents a network of very 
different origin There have been studies of small-size networks such as the Jazz instrumentalists collaboration network 
17 the underground railway routes network in Boston 18 the airline networks of China and US 19 the power grid 
network of China and US 420 the Indian railway network and the company board member collaboration network 
222 One can still obtain valuable statistics about these networks if the analysis of the data is done properly 
2  RESULTS 
According to our immune network which we have built we obtain some results as follows using some 
algorithm 
21     Act     Degree   Distribution 
The act degree is an important geometric properties of the complex network Act degree stand for an actor take 
part in how many act In our immune system act degree can be understood as how many cells secret the same mediator 
Fig 2 shows the act degree distribution of the immune system the distribution can be well described using power law 
with index of 18  It reveal that there are some nodes with high degree The biggest act degree is 25 The act degree of 
two mediators are 25 They are TNF-alpha and IL-8 This shows that 25 kinds of cells can secret the two mediators 
The act degree of four kinds mediators is 24 They are TNF-alpha receptors CCL5 IL-6IL-2 receptors The act degree 
of five kinds mediators is 23 They are TNF-beta receptors TNF-betaIL-4 receptorsIL-1 beta CD54 These mediators 
are very important in the regulation of immune activity For example
inflammatory response which is produced by infection TGF-beta IL-6 and so on promote tumor cell 
growth and metastasis IL-2 and IFN- mediated naturalization reactivity CCL5 attract immune cells to the 
local immune response and involved in immune regulation and immunopathological response 
  TNF-alpha IL-6 IL-8 take part in the 
22  Dyad Act Degree 
Dyad act degree is another important properties for bipartite network Dyad is that two actors and the relationship 
of them 
Dyad act degree is that a dyad take part in how many act In our system we can understood as two mediators can be 
secreted by how many cells Fig3 shows dyad act degree distribution of the immune system the distribution can be 
well described by typical SPLshift power law 14 functions The biggest dyad act degree is 22 
23  Assortativity 
In 2002 Newman raised another important parameter of complex network which is assortativity
20 using a 
parameter r in between -1 and 1 to describe Assortativity is that the nodes of the network is whether establish edge 
links with most similar type other nodes of the network When r is greater than zero nodes establish edge links with 
similar type other nodes of the network the network is called assortative matching When r is less than zero  nodes 
establish edge links with most unsimilar type other nodes of the network the Network is called disassortative matching 
In our Immune System we draw single assortativity with -0278609 While multiple edges is counted we draw 
multiassortative with 0143845 The results is consistent to the empirical studies of other system For example 
Newman had the view that social networks are assortative mixing and non-social are disassortative mixing Some other 
draw that single assortative of non-social network is lesser than zero and   multiassortative is greater than zero   
In this paper we propose a new similarity definition Similarity of the immune network is the possibilities which each 
two cells have the common mediators  Its formula is defined as   
Similarity 
Eij is the adjacency matrix of immune system  I and  I  are cells and j is mediator N is the total nodes of the 
immune system Ki is the degree of   I   cell The value of s is between 0 and 1 If s is equal to 1 then the function of 
all cells are the same If s is equal to 0 then the function of all cells are not identical By our computation the similarity 
of our immune system is 013 It reveals that the possibility of every two different cells secreting the same mediators is 
only 013 This is consisted with our actual immune system For example accessory cells only secret Stem Cell Factor 
and A549 cells secret Eotaxin and CCL11 This confirmed our guess which any two different cells secreting the same 
mediators have low possibility Of course low possibility does not mean that there is no possibility Some very 
important cells can secret the same mediators and those mediators are also very important in immune system Such as 
IL-2 IL-10 ect 
Fig 2    The graph shows the result of the act degree distribution of immune system The solid lines represent the least square fitting 
of the data 
Fig 3  The   graph shows the result of the Dyad act degree distribution of    immune system The solid lines represent the least 
square fitting of the data 
3  Conclusion 
   From our above analysis we found that some mediators with high degree are very important mediators in the process 
of regulating immune activity For example like TNF-alpha IL-8 TNF-alpha receptors CCL5 IL-6 IL-2 receptors 
TNF-beta receptors TNF-beta IL-4 receptors IL-1 beta CD54 ect These mediators are important in immune system 
to regulate their activity We also found that the assortative of the immune system are negative It reveals that our 
immune system is non-social network Finally we found each two cells similar to a small extent It reveals that each cell 
has its unique features For example like T cells and B cells they are all belong to lymphocytes and are main 
force of non-specific immune system But the role they played is not the same  T cells implement cellular 
immunity and B cells implement humoral immunity  The results are well consistent to our preknowledge of 
immune system 
     The work which we have done is just the beginning We hope to find more properties of the immune system by 
complex network analysis
