Abstract
Intracellular signaling often arises from ligand-induced oligomerization of cell
surface receptors This oligomerization or clustering process is fundamentally
a cooperative behavior between near-neighbor receptor molecules the proper-
ties of this cooperative process clearly aects the signal transduction Recent
investigations have revealed the molecular basis of receptor-receptor interac-
tions but a simple theoretical framework for using this data to predict cluster
formation has been lacking Here we propose a simple coarse-grained phe-
nomenological model for ligand-modulated receptor interactions and discuss
its equilibrium properties via mean-eld theory The existence of a rst-order
transition for this model has immediate implications regarding the robustness
of the cellular signaling response

I INTRODUCTION
Cell growth dierentiation migration and apoptosis are in part regulated by extracel-
lular polypeptide growth factors or cytokines Heldin 1995 Stuart and Jones 1995 As
these molecules are unable to pass through the hydrophobic cell membrane they have to
bind to the extracellular domains of specic surface receptors in order to exert their eects
Much eort has gone into investigating the fundamental question of how the ligand-receptor
interaction can trigger the proper intracellular signals One popular hypothesis is that
ligand-induced clustering of ligand-receptor complexes can be a key element in the proper
activation of downstream signals Ashkenazi and Dixit 1998 Bray and Levin 1998 Heldin
1995 Germain 1997 Lemmon and Schlessinger 1994 1998 Reich et al 1997 Sakihama
et al 1995
As an example of this line of reasoning we consider the signaling cascade mediated by
the binding of tumor necrosis factor TNF to the receptor TNF-R1 Internally the cyto-
plasmic domain of TNF-R1 is sensed by a variety of adaptor proteins namely TRADD
FADD TRAF2 and RIP this sensing leads eventually to NFBJNKSAPK activation
and apoptosis To accomplish the downstream signaling an oligomerization of these adap-
tor proteins is required Ashkenazi and Dixit 1998 One way to facilitate oligomerization
is via construction of a molecular scaolding via TNF-induced TNF-R1 clustering
known that TNF-R1 will not aggregate in the absence of TNF this is due to the association
of an inhibitor silencer of death domain SODD which normally attaches to TNF-R1
cytoplasmic domains and prevents receptor aggregation Jiang et al 1999 or alternatively
due to the receptor extracellular domains since spontaneous association of TNF-R1 has been
observed in cells that express truncated receptors Boldin et al 1995 Vandevoorde et al
1997 TNF treatment however can bring two or more receptors into proximity via its
multiple binding capacity Jones et al 1990 1992 This proximity might squeeze out
SODD Jiang et al 1999 expose the cytoplasmic death domains to adaptor proteins
and thereby stabilize receptor clusters Thus a molecular scaoldnuclei is generated to
initiate signaling
Over a longer time scale the signaling messages can provide feedback to modify the
capability of surface receptor clustering Humphries 1996 Wyszynski et al 1997 This
leads to a complex dynamical process involving both the intracellular signaling cascades
as well as the surface receptor clustering The self-organization made possible by these
feedbacks has been intensively discussed for signaling cascades see eg Jafri and Keizer
1995 Barkai and Leibler 1997 Much less is understood however regarding the role of
receptor clustering It is clear though that given the hypothesis that cellular signaling relies
on the formation of receptor clusters the temporal and spatial characteristics of clustering
would certainly aect the process of signaling transduction Thus modeling the physical
properties of receptor clustering is as important as modeling signaling cascades
Since clustering is due to an interaction between nearest-neighbor receptors it is obvi-
ously a cooperative process From a physics perspective a system with this type of coop-
erativity can exhibit a rst order phase transition corresponding to a jump in the surface
density of ligand-receptor complexes In the coexistence region of this transition the surface
will spontaneously segregate into two phases dilute and dense This rst order phase tran-
sition endows the signal transduction process with the ability to produce a digital signal in
an analog world this is independent of the details of intracellular cascades instead arising
from the intrinsic cooperativity in ligand-receptor interaction This has not been adequately
addressed in the few models studied to date Goldstein and Wiegel 1983 Goldstein and
Perelson 1984 Riley et al 1995 Coutsias et al 1997 Shea et al 1997
The purpose of this work is to introduce a phenomenological model for the TNF-TNFR1
system to describe the onset of receptor clustering phase separation Specically we
assume that clustering can be described by the statistical mechanics of a simple lattice
Hamiltonian incorporating the fundamental mechanism of a multimeric binding capacity
for the ligand We will calculate via mean-eld theory a phase diagram and show that
clustering will be thermodynamically favored for some range of ligand and receptor densities
Finally we will do a simple Monte Carlo simulation of this system showing that receptor
diusion will lead rapidly to cluster formation in the relevant parameter range We neglect
the possibility that there exist long-time feedbacks to modify the clustering capacity and
we ignore some inessential details of the receptor-ligand interaction More detailed models
including these eects as well as applications to other signaling systems will be presented
in the future
II THE LATTICE HAMILTONIAN
In our model we treat the cell surface as a lattice with a spacing of the order of a
few nm this is the closest that neighboring receptors can get to each other Each lattice
site i has either one or zero receptor molecules denoted as ni  1 or 0 Our receptor has
only two states
liganded or unliganded and the interaction between receptor molecules
is determined by their states This two-state model is over-simplied yet we will see
that it gives reasonable predictions for the phase diagram A state label ti  1 or 2 to
represent unliganded or liganded then can be assigned to each occupied receptor We will
further assume that the only ligands on the surface are those bound to receptors If we let
the chemical potential of the ligand be L and that of the receptor be R we then get a
contribution to the eective Hamiltonian of the system
H1n t  Xi
tini
where 1  R and 2  R  L  gL and gL is the binding energy between ligand
and receptor
We should clarify the relationship between the parameters used here and those in real
experiments Using standard ideas Changeux et al 1967 we notice that with only this
term the partition function can be factorized and reduced to a single site problem

From this we can immediately obtain the expectation values of the TNF-R1 concentra-
tion in the liganded and unliganded states These are assumed to correspond to the
equilibrium condition of the following reaction Corti et al 1994 Grell et al 1998
TNF-R1mTNF  TNF  TNF-R1m with a corresponding equilibrium dissociation con-
d  059 nM where the notation TNF-R1m means TNF-
R1 molecule distributed on the articial membrane and where the brackets   eq indicates

 K tnf
the equilibrium concentration of the respective molecule From this we have eLgL 
 To obtain the parameters individually we might employ an ideal gas law for the
ligand This yields eLTNFcid16

60kBT  with h as Planck constant and mtnf as the mass of TNF
We next add a receptor-receptor interaction term This takes the general form
H2n t  
Jijati tjninj
Here Jij  1 only when i j are nearest-neighbors and is otherwise 0 g1 The function
ati tj indicates a state-dependent interaction energy between nearest-neighbor recep-
tors namely a1 1 is the energy between two unliganded receptors a1 2  a2 1 is
the energy between one liganded and one unliganded receptors and a2 2 is the energy
between two liganded receptors We note that in general higher order terms might exist
especially considering the trimeric nature of the TNF ligand in our model problem We
have similarly neglected the details of the interactions of the ctyoplasmic domains as per
our earlier discussion Our goal is to elucidate the basic idea regarding clustering in the
simplest possible model assured that adding more details will not change the basic notion
that there exists a rst-order transition due to the cooperativity
a1 2 and a2 1 are the interaction energies for which we will use an eective binding
strength gE of the order of gL10 arising via one or two hydrogen bonds between receptors
It is important to realize that our simplied model does not treat explicitly the formation of
multimers via the multimeric binding Instead it arbitrarily assigns the one ligand binding
two receptors into a dimer eg to one of the receptors and describes the dimeric binding
as an attraction between a bound and an unbound receptor Because of this the model
cannot distinguish between this relatively strong interaction and the subsequent much weaker
interaction between the dimers In future work we will show that this complication does
not alter the basic picture presented here
As discussed above in the TNF system there is probably a short-range and non-specic
excluding interaction between two unliganded or two liganded with dierent ligand
molecules receptors For the sake of simplicity we will assume that the repulsive energy is
of the same order of the associative one ie a1 1  a2 2  gE This assumption is
not necessary yet it greatly simplies the mathematical task for analysis
The symmetry of ati tj allows us to introduce a simple matrix notation for the total
Hamiltonian H1  H2 If we use two-component vectors for the state-labeling i 
ti  1 and i 
 for ti  2 then the Hamiltonian can be rewritten as
 for
Hni i  Xi
ni1 2i 
Jijninj 
i 
 j
 with i  1 Then
1  i
2
Here 1 2 is an 1  2 matrix The simplicity of using this form of the matrix ati tj
can immediately be seen if we make a transformation i  1

Hni i  xXi

where x  1  22 is the averaged receptor chemical potential and y  1 
22 is directly related to the ligand concentration ey r TNF

then reads

where Pnii means ensemble summation over the three dierent congurations ni

If we dene a new notation ui  nii our model would be very similar to a spin-1
antiferromagnetic AFM BEG model Blume et al 1971
Hui  xXi

The origin of this AFM behavior is the negative cooperation between nearest-neighbor
receptors as we have imposed that a proximity of two unliganded or two liganded recep-
tors will cost energy Similar behavior might occur in the erythropoietin receptor EPO-R
and the human Growth hormone receptor hGH-R systems Heldin 1995 This negative
cooperation will give rise to an absence of clustering in extreme highlow ligand concentra-
tion ie y   and thereby result in a bell-shape or window-like signaling response
Elliott et al 1996
We should point out that this negative cooperation is not universal In the case of EGF-
R epidermal growth factor receptor system a ferromagnetic FM behavior positive
cooperation is more likely since there clustering requires two or more liganded receptors
Lemmon et al 1997 Thus the higher the ligand concentration the more the EGF-R
cluster can be formed and the EGF-EGFR signaling response behaves in a sigmoidal rather
than a window-like pattern
It is clear that in both EGF-R and TNF-R and hGH-R
EPO-R systems the ligand multiple binding capacity is the essential ingredient to induce
clustering of course one should consider the eect from receptor cytoplasmic domain as
well Which kind of cooperation negative or positive one should one consider depends
on the details of the receptor-receptor interaction also including the chemical modications
on receptor cytoplasmic domains and needs to be be established experimentally But
the essential feature of a rst-order-transition-like behavior in receptor clustering is not
dependent on the sign of this additional cooperativity
III NUMERICAL SIMULATION
To see if our model can generate clustering we perform a Monte Carlo simulation on
a square lattice with the standard Metropolis scheme For simplicity we x the number
liganded and unliganded receptors and do not allowed these to uctuate Given the rather
strong binding this is not an important constraint Furthermore we allow motion only for
individual recpetors and do not explicitly allow a clusters to move as a whole this might
not be the case in reality The jumping probability for a receptor to move to another
lattice site is determined by the Hamiltonian and obeys the detailed balance law In detail
we pick a receptor at random and try to move it in a randomly chosen direction The move
is accepted if it lowers the energy and the move is accepted with probability eH if the
energy increases
From g2 we immediately see that for a given receptor density changing the ligand
concentration moves the system from a non-clustering to a clustering phase In this gure
the open lled circles indicate liganded unliganded receptor molecules respectively Note
that the open and lled circles are arranged in an alternative way to form the cluster ie
inside a cluster the nearest neighbors of the open circles must be lled circles and vice
versa This implies that the equilibrium state which must be translationally invariant
can be described via dividing the system into two interleaved sub-lattice systems one sub-
lattice is occupied by one species of receptor molecule liganded or unliganded and all its
nearest neighbors belong to the alternative sub-lattice which is occupied by another species
To obtain more insight into the conditions where receptor clustering can take place we
next analyze the partition function via the mean-eld approximation
IV MEAN FIELD APPROXIMATION
To proceed we decouple the quadratic term in the Hamiltonian by introducing an aux-
iliary Gaussian eld and employing the standard Hubbard-StratonovichGaussian transfor-
mation see eg Amit 1993 Parisi 1988 eqnA3 The benet of this transformation is
to decouple the quadratic terms into linear terms such that we can sum over the ensemble
conguration ni i at each lattice site i independently This yields see Appendix for
details

where D  Qi di and C is a normalization constant which does not aect the thermo-
dynamic properties of the partition function The new eld  ranges from  to 
y  L  gL2 and z  ex  eRLgL2 is related to the receptor chemical poten-
tial which remains to be determined in terms of the receptor density The rst term in
eqn8 is related to the interaction energy between nearest-neighbor lattice points whereas
the second term is related to the entropy arising due to the available congurations on an
individual lattice site
In mean-eld theory we try to determine a homogeneous saddle point approximation
for the partition function For our system the negative cooperation ie the AFM nature
suggests that the system might prefer having neighboring sites in oppositely liganded states
Thus we separate the lattice into two interleaved sub-lattice systems all nearest-neighbors
of a lattice site belong to the alternate sub-lattice g1 We then assign two uniform order
parameters  to each sublattice After this assumption the exponent of the Boltzmann
factor in the partition function eqn8 now becomes  N
N is the number of total lattice sites S  Pk ln12z coshgEDk y and D
is the number of nearest neighbors which depends on the structure of lattice For instance
2 gED  S  where
a square lattice yields D  4 whereas a honeycomb lattice yields D  3
Next we minimize the free energy by varying  The variation yields the saddle point
equation

 Working this out explicitly we nd a self-consistent equation for e

V THE ONSET OF CLUSTERING

U 2k1m
where U kw  dkUwdwk The basic idea of separating out the  dependence is that
solutions with non-zero values of  represent phases in which the proximity of neighboring
receptors gives rise to alternating ligand binding For very small receptor densities there are
few neighboring receptors and hence we expect to nd a unique solution of the mean-eld
equations with   0 In fact it is clear from eqn 13 that there is a solution with   0 for
all values of the parameters but at larger densities there may be other more stable phases
The goal of our analysis will be to understand the general structure of the phase diagram
and then to obtain more quantitative detail by numerical means
To proceed let us assume that  is small and solve eqns12 13 to order 2

U 2m0

We must consider separately the cases where the denominator of eqn 16 is positive
or negative Let us rst imagine it is positive Then the existence of a non-trivial solution
of eqn
16 requires that gEDhni  m2
0  1  0 At small hni this condition will
clearly fail and we will have only the trivial solution Also this condition will fail at hni
close to 1 for large enough y We can see this by comparing the equation for m0 with the
expression for hni Note that if y is large enough such that the hyperbolic functions can
be replaced by exponentials we have m0  hni and the above expression can be replaced
by gEDhni  hni2  1 this is negative for the stated condition As we cross a line in
parameter space such that this factor changes sign to positive there will be new solutions
at non-zero 2 and the one at   0 becomes a local maximum of the free energy This
emergence of a double-well structure with a continuous growth the non-zero 2 solution
indicates that the system exhibits a second-order phase transition
We must next take into account the possibility that nm1U 2m0  1
6 U 3m0o  0
Having the denominator cross zero gives rise in our current approximation to a large value
of  which thus invalidates the neglect of higher-order terms Typically the higher-order
terms will stabilize the system at some nite value of  which thus appears spontaneously
as some parameter threshold is crossed This is a rst-order phase transition or equivalently
a triple-well structure for the free energy If the local minima for zero and non-zero 2 have
equally low free energy density the system can exist in a mixture of the two phases As
we will see the two coexisting phases dier in their receptor density Finally the points
where both gEDhni  m2
end-points points since they correspond to places where a second-order transition line
0  1  0 and nm1U 2m0  1
6 U 3m0o  0 are critical
ends at a rst-order line A diagram of this behavior generated by the numerical solution
of the mean-eld equations is given in g 3
For a given ligand concentration we can nd the phase coexistence lines arising due to
the rst-order phase transition This is done by nding two solutions solved with diering
values of 2 of the mean eld equations and then xing z as a function of y by requiring
that they have equal free-energy
f d d z  f c
  c
where c
  are the order parameters for the dense condensed phase and d the equal
ones for the dilute phase For the condensed phase the receptor density is close to unity for
reasonable values of the cooperativity parameter gED The workings of this system as far
as signaling is concerned is shown in g 4 Assume there is some xed value of the receptor
density As the ligand concentration is increased we will cross the phase transition boundary
and the receptors will segregate into a condensed phase and a dilute one corresponding to
the two co-existing mean-eld solutions Under our basic hypothesis that signaling is eected
by having dense clusters the response will exhibit a sharp jump at a specic threshold ligand
concentration Similarly as the ligand concentration becomes too high we cross back to the
uniform receptor density state and signaling ceases That is we have a ligand concentration
window for receptor clustering
As can seen from the gure the clustering window will cease to exist below some
minimal receptor density as we never enter the phase coexistence region By symmetry this
minimal density can be found by solving the mean eld equations for y  0 where m  0
This leads after some algebra to the self-consistent equations
with   hnid
egE D22  1
coshgED  1
min tanhgED
The numerical solution of these equations is presented in g5 As the cooperativity pa-
rameter is increased the minimum density which will support a clustering window goes
rapidly to zero For the TNF-TNFR1 cluster it has been speculated that the structure
of cluster is a honeycomb-like lattice Bazzoni and Beutler 1995 Naismith et al 1995
1996 which implies the number of nearest-neighbor D  3 If we use our rough estimate
gE  gL10  6kT  we nd that hnid
spacing
0 Here a0 is length scale of the lattice
If we take a0  1 nm on a cell with surface area 100m2 this estimate yields
a requirement for less than 102 TNF-R1 molecule distributed on the cell surface Given
 106a2
that an average number of expressed TNF-R1 on cell surface is  2000 we nd that the
cell operates within the desired part of the phase diagram and hence should exhibit strong
sensitivity to the application of TNF However we should point out that this estimate is
very rough as we have made a number of simplifying assumptions and this issue needs to
be re-visited with a more precise model of the receptor interactions
VI DISCUSSION
We have presented a simple model for signal transduction via receptor clustering based
loosely on the TNF-TNFR1 system Our basic idea is simple The interaction between
receptors can lead to a rst-order phase transition with a discontinuous jump in the receptor
density as a function of the receptor chemical potential andor the ligand concentration
Turning this around this implies that the receptor system will spontaneously phase separate
for a range of ligand concentrations This fact about the thermodynamic equilibrium state
will lead under reasonable kinetic assumptions to the rapid formation of receptor clusters
Assuming that these clusters are necessary for the signal to proceed downstream has the
immediate consequence that the system exhibits a strong robust response independent of
any details of the intracellular signaling cascade This might provide a simple solution to
the problem faced by biological evolution of how to get digital response in an analog world
From a physics perspective there is nothing very surprising about our phase diagram
ndings The idea of a lattice Hamiltonian with intrinsic cooperativity has been pro-
posed before Changeux et al 1967 and on general grounds models of this sort can be
expected to have rst order phase transitions What is new here is the connection of the tran-
sition to signaling via the idea of receptor clustering This connects nicely with increasing
evidence that clustering is universal among many types of receptor classes
In our model we have ignored more-than-two receptor interaction and relevant internal
chemical degrees of freedom such as the dissociation of SODD in the TNF-R1 system
We do not expect these detailed considerations to change the overall picture but a more
sophisticated model will be needed to make more quantitative estimates of ligand thresholds
cluster structures and most interestingly clustering dynamics We hope to report on these
issues in the future as well as on the extension of our models to other ligand-receptor
systems
Finally it would be important to extend our work to later-stage dynamics as that would
allow the consideration of processes such as adaptor protein-mediated receptor internaliza-
tion cytoskeleton-assisted cluster stabilization receptor anity regulation receptor cross
talk and adaptation Barkai and Leibler 1997 Hahn et al 1993 Humphries et al 1996
Holsinger et al 1998 Luo and Lodish 1997 Stewart et al 1998 Sundberg and Rubin

volve the inclusion of spatial uctuations the explicit treatment of external perturbations
Shoyab and Todaro 1981 the local heterogeneity of the micro-environment Bean et al
1988 Ward and Hammer 1992 or uctuations of ligand concentration all of these issues
have been neglected here
