Background The neutral mutation rate is known to vary widely along human chromosomes
leading to mutational hot and cold regions
MethodologyPrinciple Findings We provide evidence that categories of functionally-related
genes reside preferentially in mutationally hot or cold regions the size of which we have measured
Genes in hot regions are biased toward extra-cellular communication surface receptors cell adhe-
sion immune response etc while those in cold regions are biased toward essential cellular processes
gene regulation RNA processing protein modication etc From a selective perspective this or-
ganization of genes could minimize the mutational load on genes that need to be conserved and allow
fast evolution for genes that must frequently adapt We also analyze the eect of gene duplication
and chromosomal recombination which contribute signicantly to these biases for certain categories
of hot genes
ConclusionsSignicance Overall our results show that genes are located non-randomly with
respect to hot and cold regions oering the possibility that selection acts at the level of gene location
in the human genome
INTRODUCTION
Because of the abundant availability of mouse and human genome data Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium
2002 International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium 2001 it has come to light that mutation rates vary
widely across dierent regions of the human genome Hardison et al 2003 Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium
2002 Matassi et al 1999 in agreement with a number of smaller-scale studies Wolfe et al 1989 Perry and Ashworth
1999 Casane et al 1997 Regions of unusually high or low substitution rates have been observed from 4-fold sites and
ancestral repeat sequences two of the best candidates for measuring neutral rates of mutation in mammals Hardison
et al 2003 Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002 Sharp et al 1995 The reasons for such regional variability
are unclear since structural characterizations of the mutation rate are nascent Whatever the reason for these hot
and cold regions their existence suggests a question that has intriguing consequences for molecular evolution does
the organism take advantage of these hot and cold spots
One way to take advantage of a hot region would be to place genes there for which the hotness is useful  an intuitive
example would be receptor proteins which must respond to a constantly changing ligand set Similarly it could be
benecial to place delicate genes in a cold region to reduce the possibility of deleterious mutations These potential
advantages oer the possibility that regional mutation rates aect the spatial organization of genes The idea of
such organization in mouse and human is bolstered by recent ndings of gene organization in yeast For example
Pal and Hurst showed that yeast genes are organized to take advantage of local recombination rates Pal and Hurst
2003 which is particularly relevant since mutation rate and recombination rate are known to be correlated Lercher
and Hurst 2002 If the local mutation rate  equivalent to the synonymous amino-acid preserving substitution
rate KS if synonymous substitutions are neutral  aects gene organization this would constitute a type of selection
complementary to traditional selection on point mutations Graur and Li 2000 
We studied whether local mutation rates aect gene locations by measuring the mutation rates of genes and their
organization in the human genome First we analyzed the substitution rates of the genes in each of the families
dened by the Gene Ontology Gene Ontology Consortium 2000  If the organism is taking advantage of varying KS
gene families should be biased toward regions of appropriate rate In fact we observe that several functional classes of
genes preferentially occur in hot or cold regions Some of the notable hot categories we observe are olfactory genes cell
adhesion genes and immune response genes while the cold categories are biased toward regulatory proteins such as
those involved in transcription regulation DNARNA binding and protein modication Also to better characterize
the hot and cold regions we measured the length scale over which substitution rates vary While rough bounds on
the size of hot and cold regions are known Hardison et al 2003 Matassi et al 1999 this paper presents the rst
quantitative calculation of their length scale
Because mutation rates are regional mutation rates in genes categories could be inuenced by events altering the
organization of genes in the genome such as gene relocation or gene duplication We therefore analyzed mechanisms
by which functional categories of genes may have become concentrated in hot or cold regions A clustering analysis
reveals that the hotness of some categories is enhanced by local gene duplications in hot regions However there
are strong functional similarities among the hot categories  both clustered and unclustered as well as among the
February 9 2008
cold categories These functional similarities imply that the instances of duplicated categories are not random ie
selection may have aected which genes have duplicated and persisted
II RESULTS
A Mutation Rates Have Regional Biases
Recently substitution rates between Mus musculus and Homo sapiens have been measured by several groups on
a genome-wide scale Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002 Hardison et al 2003 Kumar and Subramanian
2002 These substitution rates vary signicantly across the genome Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002
Hardison et al 2003 suggesting that neutral mutation rates may have regional biases as well A popular proxy for
neutral mutation rates is the substitution rate at 4-fold sites a recent example is Kumar and Subramanian 2002
base positions in coding DNA which do not aect protein sequence and which should hence be under less selective
pressure than other sites The 4-fold sites also oer the advantage of being easily alignable
For these reasons we estimated the neutral mutation rate from substitution rates at 4-fold sites which we use
interchangeably with the term KS in this paper This identication is not without complexities however since
there are processes which can in principle selectively aect the 4-fold sites For example some have argued that
exogenous factors such as isochore structure inuence the silent sites Bernardi 2000 and codon usage adaptation
has been shown to aect silent sites in bacteria and yeast Sharp and Li 1987 Percudani and Ottonello 1999 So
far such selective eects have been dicult to detect in mammals Iida and Akashi 2000 Kanaya et al 2001 Duret
and Mouchiroud 2000 Smith and Hurst 1999a Recently Hardison et al showed that several functionally unrelated
measures of mutation rate including SNP density substitutions in ancestral repeats and substitutions in 4fold sites
are correlated in genome-wide mouse-human comparisons Hardison et al 2003  suggesting that these measures
have common neutral aspects
We constructed our own dataset of the 4-fold substitution rates for 14790 mousehuman orthologous genes using
data from the Ensembl consortium In order to properly account for stochastic nite-size eects we mapped the
observed substitution rates to a normalized value based on the assumption that all 4-fold sites mutate at the same
rate see Methods Under this assumption it was expected that the normalized substitution rates would follow the
Normal distribution a gaussian with   1
Contrary to these expectations the distribution of ortholog substitution rates was found to be highly biased toward
high or low rates indicating that 4-fold mutation rates vary substantially by location and on a scale larger than
the typical size of a gene Fig 1 shows the distribution of substitution rates for all mousehuman orthologs The
observed distribution has excesses of genes at both high and low substitution rates These results are in agreement
with the ndings of Matassi et al Matassi et al 1999 who reported signicant mutation rate correlations between
neighboring genes This is not a compositional eect  the distribution remained the same even when corrections
for the genes human base composition were made see Methods We further veried that substitution rates of
neighboring genes were correlated using an analysis qualitatively similar to Matassi et al  though with approximately
20 times more orthologs  nding that gene substitution rates are correlated with their neighbors with a p-value of
10189 See Methods These results imply that substitution rates have regional biases acting both within a gene and
over longer length scales
B Some Gene Categories Are Biased Toward Hot or Cold Regions
We next considered whether there is a relationship between gene locations and their functions
ie whether
functional categories of genes have biases for being in regions of particular mutation rate To test whether such
biases exist we performed an analysis of the Gene Ontology GO assignments for each ortholog pair Gene Ontology
Consortium 2000 using data from the Ensembl human ENSMART database to assign genes to GO categories For
each GO category we calculated a z-score to measure the overall substitution rate based on the substitution rates
of the genes in the category see Methods The 21 GO categories having statistically signicant positive values of z
are shown in Table I In terms of 4-fold substitution rates the hot category rate averages were found to range from
0346 integral to membrane to 0468 internalization receptor activity while the genome-wide average was 0337
with gene-wise standard deviation 008 For a category with several genes the eective standard deviation is much
smaller equal to 008NGO where NGO is the number of genes in the category so these rate biases are extremely
signicant Hot gene categories were focused mainly in receptor-type functions along with a few other categories
such as proteolysis and microtubule motor activity Some preferences were partially because categories have genes in
February 9 2008
common eg 8 genes are shared between the categories dynein ATPase activity dynein complex and microtubule-
based movement category However there were several categories of similar function which were independent eg
membrane and olfactory receptor activity shared no genes and cell adhesion and immune response shared only 5
of their genes Overall there was a clear bias for the larger hot categories to contain receptor-type proteins eg
receptor activity olfactory receptor activity G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway membrane and
immune response For the set of all genes where the string receptor is part of the GO description the average 4-fold
substitution rate was found to be 0347 The probability for the set of 1488 receptor genes to have a mutation rate
this high is 106
The 36 statistically signicant GO categories with negative z scores are shown in Table II The 4-fold rate
averages for the cold categories ranged from 0220 mRNA binding activity to 0326 protein serinethreonine kinase
activity The coldest gene categories included nuclear proteins transcription regulation DNA and RNA binding
oncogenesis phosphatases and kinases all of which are important to regulatory processes Many of these genes are
also housekeeping genes Hsiao et al 2001 For the set of all genes where the string regulat is part of the GO
description the average 4-fold substitution rate was found to be 0325 The probability for the set of 1704 regulation
genes to have a mutation rate this high is 109
We repeated our z-score classications using several other measures of mutation rate and in each case inferred
similar hot and cold categories For example under the normalized rate model that accounts for human base com-
position the same set of 23 hot categories were found Of the 37 cold categories 33 remained classied as cold The
4 lost were regulation of transcription from Pol II promoter development neurogenesis and translation regulator
activity There were 6 new categories and these were also largely regulatory nucleic acid binding activity translation
initiation factor activity ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase activity collagen RNA processing and negative regulation
of transcription We also calculated several maximum likelihood ML measures of KS using mutation models in the
PAML package Yang 1997 including the Nei and Gojobori Nei and Gojobori 1986 codon-based measure and the
Tamura-Nei TN93 and REV Tavere 1986 models We again found qualitatively similar sets of hot and cold cate-
gories  receptor genes at high substitution rates and regulatory genes at low substitution rates  though there were
changes in the numbers of signicant categories For example for the TN93 model we observed 10 hot categories in-
duction of apoptosis by extracellular signals G-protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway olfactory receptor
activity receptor activity apoptosis enzyme activity chymotrypsin activity trypsin activity integral to membrane
and dynein ATPase activity and 8 cold categories calcium-dependent protein serinethreonine phosphatase activ-
ity ribonucleoprotein complex protein serinethreonine kinase activity RNA binding activity protein amino acid
dephosphorylation intracellular protein transport protein transporter activity and nucleus The categories inferred
from our original z-score analysis are probably more accurate than those from ML methods because ML methods
tend to produce strong outliers at high substitution rate skewing calculations of the variance in the z-score analysis
C Can Gene Duplications Explain the Hot and Cold Categories
Given the existence of hot and cold gene categories the question then becomes why do these biases exist One
potentially non-selective factor that could aect category rate biases is local gene duplications New genes generally
arise by duplication in which a new copy of a gene is generated nearby to the pre-existing gene by a recombinatorial
event such as unequal crossing-over followed by evolution to a novel but often related function Graur and Li
2000 Such local duplications can cause many genes with similar function to be clustered together Because there
are regional biases in mutation rate discussed in the section on Block Structure of the Correlation Length these
functionally-related genes will tend to have similar mutation rates GO categories containing these genes will then be
biased toward the mutation rate of the region surrounding the genes
We tested the eect of gene duplications on category rates through a clustering analysis see Methods If gene
duplications are not important to category rates genes in a hot cold gene category would be expected to be
distributed randomly throughout the many hot cold regions around the genome ie clustering of genes would
be weak However if gene duplications are relevant we would expect hot cold genes of the same category to
be tightly clustered since many of these genes would have arisen by local duplications We therefore studied the
location distribution of each of the gene categories and analyzed the signicance of its clustering using the short-
range correlation length   106 base pairs see the section on Block Structure as a dening length scale This
analysis was similar to that of Williams and Hurst who studied clustering of tissue-specic genes Williams and
Hurst 2002 though we analyzed a larger number of more narrowly dened gene families
We found that some of the hot gene categories were indeed clustered but that none of the cold gene categories
were The results of the clustering for the hot and cold categories are displayed in Tables I and II with the clustering
p-values shown via their  log10 values  Of the 21 statistically signicant hot categories 10 categories had statistically
signicant clustering  log10 pcluster  3 For example the olfactory receptor activity category GO0004984 has 223
February 9 2008
genes with a randomly expected number of clustered genes equal to 306 The actual number of clustered genes
was found to be 190 which has a p-value of less than 1016 In the set of 37 cold gene GO categories none had
statistically signicant clustering The clustering signicance is plotted versus the substitution score z for all the
GO categories with at least 5 members in Fig2 There were many categories of hot genes with signicant clustering
log pcluster  3 but virtually no cold ones
As an example of clustering in the hot gene categories we considered the olfactory receptors GO0004984 It
is well-established that olfactory receptors occur in clusters throughout the human genome Rouquier et al 1998
and we likewise observed the olfactory receptors to be highly clustered in three regions near the head middle and
tail of Chromosome 11 Fig 3 The central is displayed in Fig 4 This clustering provided evidence that local gene
duplications have inuenced the high category rate of the olfactory genes
We next attempted to determine if the high olfactory rates are due to a regional bias The substitution rates of
all genes are plotted in Fig 4 with the olfactory genes in red As expected the olfactory genes exhibited an obvious
bias for higher substitution rates than other genes We next calculated the mutation rate of the region as determined
from an independent measure the substitution rates between ancestral repeat sequences green curve using data
published by Hardison et al Hardison et al 2003 see Methods The repeat sequence mutation rate was notably
higher in the regions where the olfactory genes occur showing that the hotness of the olfactory genes is a regional
property and not specic to the genes
Similar clustering and regional hotness were observed for other hot gene categories We plot the substitution rates
of a cluster of homophilic cell adhesion genes GO0007156 on Chromosome 5 in Fig 5 along with the rates of
nearby genes and the ancestral repeat sequence substitution rates The same features observed for the olfactory
genes were also present for the cell adhesion genes clustering high substitution rates and an elevated ancestral
repeat substitution rate The repeat substitution rate exhibited a plateau-like behavior over the region dened by the
homophilic cell adhesion genes These factors support the interpretation that signicant numbers of hot genes have
arisen by duplications in inherently hot regions of the genome
D Block Structure of the Substitution Rate
Several explanations have been proposed that could account for the regional biases in mutation rate Mouse Genome
Sequencing Consortium 2002 including recombination-associated mutagenesis Lercher and Hurst 2002 Perry and
Ashworth 1999 strand asymmetry in mutation rates Francino 1997 and inhomogeneous timing of DNA replication
Wolfe et al 1989 Gu and Li 1994 The structure of regional biases could be considered from the perspective of
amino-acid changing substitutions as well since linked proteins have been known to have similar substitution rates
Williams and Hurst 2000 Williams and Hurst 2002 However the silent sites may be easier to comprehend since
protein sequences are more likely to be complicated by non-neutral pressures
To shed light on the structural properties of the hot and cold mutational regions we measured the length scale over
which substitution rates are correlated Previously correlations have been observed in blocks of particular physical 5
megabases Hardison et al 2003 or genetic 1 2 5 200 centimorgans Matassi et al 1999 Lercher et al 2001 size
While these studies have focused on whether correlations exist at certain length scales it is informative to measure
the decay of correlations with distance We therefore measured the length scale of substitution rate correlation using
an analysis of the correlation function Huang 1987
 r0rt 
where rt is the substitution rate of a gene t basepairs downstream of a gene with substitution rate r0 and   
indicates an average over the available data see Methods We expect that at small t the correlation function will
be positive and then decrease with t as rates become decoupled The length scale over which this decay occurs serves
as a measure of the typical size of hot or cold regions The rate correlation function is plotted in Fig 6 versus both
the human and mouse values for t
We observed two notable behaviors 1 a strong correlation which decays over a region of approximately 1 megabase
and 2 a longer range correlation which plateaus over a region of approximately 10 megabases At larger distances
correlations are weaker For example the human curve rst dips below the  r0rt  0 threshold at approximately
11 Mb and the mouse curve rst crosses it at approximately 9 Mb This suggests that there are multiple phenomena
which control the mutation rate of regions both long 10 Mb and short 1 Mb length scale
We also measured the characteristic short-range correlation length using an exponential t The correlation length
 was determined by tting the data to the functional form
 r0rt  A0 expt   A
February 9 2008
where A is the correlation at long distances and A0  A is the correlation at zero distance Because of the
observed plateauing behavior of the data we performed our curve t over the region t  0 10000000 For the human
data we obtained A0  083   121  106 A  039 For the mouse data we found values of a similar magnitude
A0  108   073  106 A  032 suggesting that short range mutational processes may be alike in mouse and
human The long range correlation A was at least an order of magnitude larger than would be expected by chance
at all distances up to 10 megabases see Methods
It is unclear what factors are responsible for these two length scales of rate correlation though some guesses are
possible For the short range eect one process that occurs on the appropriate lengthscale is DNA replication Alberts
et al 1994 Replication origins in a concerted unit activate under similar timing similar cell conditions and could
have a common regulatory mechanism making it a reasonable to expect the DNA in such a unit to have similar
mutation rates
Long range correlations have previously been observed at chromosomal-size distances in particular regions of the
genome eg it is known that Chromosome 19 is generally hotter than other chromosomes Castresana 2002 Lercher
et al 2001 However the 10 megabase correlation was not simply due to selection on chromosomes We removed the
respective chromosomal average from each substitution rate and repeated the correlation analysis nding that A
retained a signicant value of  02 One possible mechanistic explanation for the long-range correlation is suggested
by the nding of Lercher et al that recombination rate and substitution rate are correlated even in blocks extending
to 30 megabases Lercher and Hurst 2002 Therefore if large regions of similar recombination rate exist they could
be related to the long-range 4-fold correlation eects we observed
III DISCUSSION
A Evidence for Selection
Recently there has been evidence for selective factors inuencing gene location in yeast Pal and Hurst 2003 This
suggests the possibility that similar phenomena aect gene locations in mousehuman as well We therefore considered
whether regional mutation rates could have selectively inuenced the types of genes occurring in dierent loci in the
genome Selection due to the local mutation rate would require dierent mechanisms than that observable through
the traditional measure KAKS which quanties selection on point mutations For example regional mutation rates
could have inuenced the tness of the genome after events that cause gene relocation such as gene transposition
or chromosomal recombination Or perhaps the duplication of certain genes provided a tness benet a mechanism
possibly relevant for the hot clustered categories Dierential duplication rates could force a category to have a
mutation rate bias due to the block structure of the mutation rate and the fact that duplications occur locally
The observed categories of hot and cold genes suggest gene locations have been selectively inuenced by regional
mutation rates This is because if mutation rates were unrelated to gene function then the lists of hot and cold
categories would be expected to be random ie the lists shown in Tables I and II would have been evenly sampled
from all possible Gene Ontology categories However this was not the case as the hot and cold categories each had
strong internal commonalities
The hot categories were found to be biased toward receptor activities or roles in extracellular communication
Intriguingly arguments based on protein-level eects appear applicable to the silent-site hotness of these categories
Cellular receptors and those involved in extracellular communication are the proteins that most directly interact
with the environment and are therefore the most likely to have experienced a dynamically changing set of selection
pressures This variability of selection pressures would have made it favorable for them to be in hot regions in
order that new mutations be possible to deal with new stimuli Examples of hot categories with known protein-level
diversication pressures include the olfactory receptors Lane et al 2001 immune genes Papavasiliou and Schatz
2002 and cell adhesion genes Uemura 1998 Tasic et al 2002
Arguments normally applied to protein-level selection were found to be appropriate for cold mutation rate categories
as well Cold categories were often related to transcription or other regulatory processes Regulatory proteins should
be tuned to interact with many dierent nucleic acid or protein targets in contrast with receptor proteins which
typically interact with only a particular ligand Mutations to regulatory proteins would therefore be expected to
be more deleterious and hence it would be benecial for them to have low mutation rates Strong conservation
pressures in the cold categories could also be related to their roles as housekeeping genes Zhang and Li 2003 or
as essential genes For example in the dataset of Winzeler et al 1999 81 out of 356 essential yeast genes were
involved in transcription whereas only 4 were involved in signal transduction the function most similar to extracellular
communication for which data was available
The applicability of protein-level arguments to synonymous mutation rates suggests that KS and KA are under
similar pressures This is consistent with what would be expected if gene locations have evolved to make use of
February 9 2008
the block structure of the mutation rate since relocation to a hot cold spot would increase propensities for both
high low KA and KS More quantitatively we observed that KS category biases were similar to category biases
caused by selection on amino acid changing point substitutions  ie selection observable through the ratio KAKS
We performed a Gene Ontology z-score analysis on KAKS for consistency the CODEML method in PAML was
used to calculate both KA and KS There were 8 hot categories common to both the 4-fold and KAKS classica-
tions  immune response proteolysis and peptidolysis receptor activity integral to membrane chymotrypsin activity
cell adhesion trypsin activity olfactory receptor activity and 17 common cold categories nucleus regulation of
transcription transcription factor activity RNA binding activity development ribonucleoprotein complex ribonucle-
oprotein complex protein transporter activity protein serinethreonine kinase activity ubiquitin conjugating enzyme
activity GTP binding activity ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism translation regulator activity intracellular
protein transport neurogenesis ubiquitin cycle cytoplasm regulation of transcription from Pol II promoter The
strong commonalities between the two types of classication suggest that the selective forces that inuenced amino-
acid changing point mutations also inuenced gene locations The hot and cold categories derived from KAKS are
available in the supplementary materials
Selection on gene locations would provide an evolutionary explanation for the puzzle of why KA and KS are
correlated beyond levels expected by neutral evolutionary theory Ohta and Ina 1995 Mouchiroud et al 1995
Assuming 4-fold sites are neutral locational selection would have to be realized through the inuence of the local
mutation rate KS on the amino-acid changing mutation rate KA Thus locational selection and point mutation-
based amino acid selection would behave similarly with respect to positive or negative selection on protein sequence
increasing the correlation of KA and KS even if mutations to any individual 4-fold site did not provide a tness
benet
One caveat is that other not necessarily exclusive explanations for the strong correlation of KA and KS have
been proposed as well  most notably simultaneous substitutions at adjacent sites so called tandem substitutions
Smith and Hurst 1999b Tandem substitutions were not sucient to explain our hot and cold categories however
We rederived sets of hot and cold categories after correcting for tandem eects see Methods and once again found
similar results For example the 6 hottest categories of 22 signicant were dynein ATPase activity receptor activity
homophilic cell adhesion olfactory receptor activity integral to membrane and calcium ion binding activity The 6
coldest of 36 were nucleus regulation of transcription DNA-dependent RNA binding activity transcription factor
activity development and ribonucleoprotein complex
B Mechanisms
For the hot clustered categories it may be that high mutation rates and high rates of gene duplication are tied
to a hidden variable which imposes both phenomena simultaneously One possibility is the recombination rate along
the genome which Pal and Hurst found to have selective eects in yeast Pal and Hurst 2003 For example two
mechanisms for diversication gene duplication and mutation can both be accelerated by recombination Lercher
and Hurst 2002 Graur and Li 2000 High recombination rates are relevant for a number of the hot gene categories
we have studied as they have been suggested for the protocadherins Wu et al 2001 immune response Papavasiliou
and Schatz 2002 and olfactory families Sharon et al 1999 Because both gene duplication and point mutation are
useful for diversifying a family it is dicult to separate the signicance of mutation rate and recombination rate Pal
and Hurst oered preliminary evidence that in yeast selection acts on the recombination rate but not point mutation
rates Pal and Hurst 2003 However we have observed unusual rate biases for non-clustered gene categories as well
for which recombination would not be expected to play a role
Cold gene categories are not clustered therefore the existence of cold categories as well as non-clustered hot
categories can not be attributed to duplication events One alternate phenomenon that could cause cold category
biases is gene relocation to cold regions The concept of relocation brings up a number of questions First if cold
genes have relocated this leaves one wondering in what sort of environment cold genes originated One speculative
possibility is that these genes developed in regions of high recombination the hot regions which would have allowed
for fast duplication and functional diversication and later dispersed to cooler regions as their functions became xed
Second it is unclear whether gene relocations occur frequently enough to account for the observed rate biases This
issue is complicated by the fact that genes have arisen at dierent times Many of the cold gene categories occur in
diverse sets of tissues and have important regulatory eects suggesting they should be relatively old This old age
may have allowed them enough time to redistribute through the genome
We veried the correlations of substitution rates along the genome and showed that these correlations lead to an
excess of hot and cold genes conrming studies by Matassi et al Matassi et al 1999 and Hardison et al Hardison
et al 2003 Our results appear to disagree with those of Kumar and Subramanian Kumar and Subramanian 2002
who reported that mutation rates are uniform in the genome While our rate measurements were qualitatively similar
February 9 2008
to those of Kumar and Subramanian one benecial addition we made was the use of a normalized rate which accounts
for the length-dependence of rate variance allowing genes of diering lengths to be treated equally in Fig 1 Our
correlation length analysis revealed two scales of rate correlation a short decay length of 1 megabase and a long range
length extending along a syntenous block up to distances of 10 megabases We have very speculatively proposed that
DNA replication units and DNA recombination may be relevant to these length scales More generally it is hoped
that these scale determinations will be helpful in placing constraints on possible processes that control mutation rate
Some data issues suggest topics for further exploration First the resolution of our analysis is dictated by the
structure of the Gene Ontology which currently has 16000 categories but is evolving Our category inferences should
become more specic as GO gene assignments improve Second multispecies data will be invaluable in revealing the
mutations that have occurred in each lineage One promising early result from human-chimpanzee comparisons based
on a set of 96 orthologs derived from HOVERGEN release 44 Duret et al 1994 is that olfactory receptors are a
hot category Unfortunately this is the only statistically signicant hot or cold category at present due to the lack
of data However inferences should improve rapidly as more chimpanzee gene identications become available
IV METHODS
A Ortholog Generation
We downloaded a list of the available 37347 human and 27504 mouse peptides from the Ensembl sequence database
wwwensemblorg then used BLAST Altschul et al 1990 to nd orthologous peptide sequences between the
genomes The peptides studied were the set of all known or predicted peptides in the Ensembl 12311 human and
1231 mouse datasets Sequences were designated as orthologous if the two peptides were each others mutual best hit
in the opposing databases as determined by blastall and the E-value for the match was 1010 using the higher score
as a worst case bound or better We chose this method of ortholog determination to get a one-to-one relationship
between proteins We found 14790 ortholog pairs a coverage rate of approximately 50 in mouse and 40  in human
The observed E-values between orthologs have a median value of 00  1e-180 The aligned peptide orthologs were
then used in conjunction with Ensembl CDNA data to determine aligned orthologous CDNA For the chimp-human
comparison human genes from ENSEMBL were compared to chimp genes from HOVERGEN A mutual best hit
criterion was used to determine the set of 96 orthologs
We manually inspected the mouse-human synteny of the olfactory gene cluster of Fig 4 to verify that orthologs
were assigned correctly This was to address the concern that orthologs are more dicult to assign in gene categories
with many homologous members since incorrect assignments could distort substitution rates The synteny structure
was found to be almost totally conserved for these genes as it was for the cell adhesion genes in Fig 5
B Calculation of Substitution Rates
We calculated the distribution of substitution rates between the mouse and human genomes using the 4fold sites of
orthologous genes 4fold sites are the 3rd bases of codons for which the amino acid is specied by the rst two bases
For each of the orthologous gene pairs we calculated p the fraction of 4fold sites in which the mouse base diers from
the human base The average value of p over all 4-fold sites in all orthologs was  p  0337 The average 4-fold
substitution rate on a genewise basis was 0338 with a standard deviation of 0080 These rates were in agreement
with substitution rates measured in other studies of 4-fold sites or in ancestral repeats Hardison et al 2003 Mouse
Genome Sequencing Consortium 2002
Because genes are of nite length stochastic eects can cause substitution rates to vary from gene to gene even
if all 4-fold sites mutate at the same rate We dened a normalized substitution rate to correct for these nite-size
eects A gene with N 4fold sites was modeled as having N independent events in which substitution can occur
with probability  p  This formulation can t both the Jukes-Cantor one-parameter or the Kimura two-parameter
model for mutation matrices Durbin et al 1998 Although this model is not as sophisticated as other more modern
treatments for example see Tavere 1986 Tamura and Nei 1993 Li 1993 Goldman and Yang 1994 it gives an
easily falsiable prediction that the rate distribution in the absence of regional correlations is Normal due to the
Central Limit Theorem Rice 1995
Under this model at each N the distribution of substitution rates can be described by a binomial distribution
with standard deviation N   p p  1  p N  Therefore gene substitution rates were normalized by their
respective N  to get one universal rate distribution which in the limit of many data points should approach the
February 9 2008
Normal distribution 212 expx22 We dened the normalized substitution rate to be
r  p  p N 
where p is the actual 4fold substitution rate in the gene The values of r for all ortholog pairs were used to calculate
the distribution shown in Fig 1
The actual rate distribution in genes was found to be skewed toward high or low mutation rates as shown in Fig 1
The observed distribution had a standard deviation of 204 signicantly higher than the expected   1 Similar
excesses of hot and cold genes were found even when corrections were made for base composition To verify this we
calculated a normalized mutation rate using a 4-parameter model in which each site of type A C G or T in the
human sequence has its own substitution probability For each human base ACGT we measured the substitution
rate at the corresponding 4-fold locations yielding 4 rates  pA   pC   pG   pT  Based on these rates
we then calculated the expected frequency and variance of substitutions for a gene given the genes base composition
at the 4-fold sites This yielded a distribution nearly identical to that in the 1-parameter model Fig 1
We also tested whether neighboring genes have similar substitution rates The orthologs were ordered by their
location along the human genome after which we calculated the Pearson correlation of a genes substitution rate r
with that of its following gene We used only neighboring genes which were in syntenous blocks as dened by all
three conditions of monotonicity the genes are ordered the same in both species consistent strand orientation a
block is either in the same strand orientation in both species or completely reversed and consistent chromosome no
chromosome changes in either species in a block yielding a dataset of 11087 neighbor pairs Under this condition
the Pearson correlation was 026 corresponding to a highly signicant p-value of 10189
z-score calculation for GO categories
For each GO category we calculated a normalized substitution rate z-score based on the substitution rates of all
members of that category 9966 of the genes in our ortholog set had Gene Ontology classications available The
z-score was dened to be
 r GO   r all
allNGO
where  r GO is the average substitution rate r for the genes in the GO category  r all is the average r for
all of the genes with Gene Ontology classications all is the genewise standard deviation and NGO is the number
of genes in the category The p-value for z was determined from the probability that a gaussian-distributed variable
again using the Central Limit Theorem takes on a value  z To reduce the problem of outliers we limited our
analysis to the GO categories containing at least 5 genes of which there are 997 and accordingly set a p-value cuto
of 1997  103 We expressed the signicance in terms of  log10 pz which should have a value larger than 3 to be
statistically signicant
z-scores corrected for tandem substitutions were calculated by rst removing all possible tandem substitution sites
from the dataset That is 4-fold sites were only accepted into the dataset if both the preceding and following bases
matched in the two species After culling the dataset we calculated rates and category z-scores as before
D Clustering Analysis
To measure clustering for each gene in a GO category we tested whether it had another category member down-
stream of it within the short-range correlation length   106 basepairs In each GO category we calculated the
number of genes satisfying this condition dening this to be the number of clustered genes This downstream
criterion rather than a symmetric one was used to avoid the problem of double counting of genes when several
are close together To test the statistical signicance of the number of clustered genes in a category we used boot-
strapping For each GO category we performed 5000 random trials of selecting NGO random genes from the entire
set of orthologs where NGO is the number of genes in the GO category In each trial we counted the number of
clustered genes in this randomly selected group The average number of clustered genes was used to approximate the
random number of clustered genes by a Poisson distribution These Poisson statistics were then used to calculate the
signicance of the number of clustered genes for the GO category A poisson distribution is appropriate as long as
clustering of neighbors is a rare event ie as long as NGO  Nallgenes which was generally the case The random
distributions were visually inspected and found to agree with the shape of the Poisson curve To generate the data for
Tables 1 and 2 we also limited ourselves to the 997 categories with at least 5 genes implying that  log10 pcluster  3
is the cuto for signicance

E Calculation of Repeat Sequence Mutation Rates
Aligned repeat sequences between mouse and human were obtained from the dataset of Hardison et al Hardison et
al 2003 For each repeat positions in which a base was dened for both the mouse and human sequence were used
to calculate a normalized substitution rate in analogy with the method used for the 4-fold sites The genome-wide
average value of p in these repeat sequences was 033 which was very close to the value for 4-fold sites 034 The start
position of each repeat sequence was used to dene its location in the genome In order to determine the locations of
repeat sequences based on the June 2002 UCSC genome map along the physical map used for the gene sequences
based on the Ensembl May 2003 map gene locations according to the two maps were compared Repeat sequence
locations were then corrected using the location dierences of nearby genes For clarity the ancestral repeat values
shown in Fig 4 and Fig 5 were smoothed using a moving-window average of 20 repeat sequences
F Correlation Length Calculation
We considered all pairs of genes on continuous orthologous blocks starting from the rst neighbor up to the 35th
gene downstream This allowed us to get hundreds of measurements of r0rt for t values even as large as several
megabases We binned these data into 100 uniformly spaced groups covering t  0 15000000 and then averaged over
each of these bins to determine the correlation function  r0rt  The data were plentiful enough for the averaged
values shown in Fig 6 to be statistically signicant It was dicult to extend to larger values of t since the amount of
data decreases with t a fact manifested in the increasing uctuations at larger t in Fig 6 For example the value of the
average correlation  r0rt  at t  15 megabases in the human data of Fig 6 was based on only 79 measurements
whereas at t  75000 it was based on 22860 measurements For genes with alternative splicings only one of the genes
was used in order to avoid spurious eects caused by reuse of DNA Orthologous block boundaries were dened
by genes at which the chromosome changes in either species Monotonicity and consistent strand orientation were
ignored in order to obtain blocks with large values of t Most of the r0rt data comes from blocks at least several
megabases long Approximately 5 is in blocks of size less than 106 base pairs 55 is in blocks of size between 106
and 107 base pairs and the remaining 40 is in larger blocks
The long-range correlation shown in Fig 6 was statistically signicant Theoretically uctuations in  rirj 
should be of order  O1N  where N is the number of data samples in a bin At a distance of 10 megabases
there were  400 samples corresponding to an uncertainty of  005 This uncertainty was an order of magnitude
smaller than the observed value of A  04
