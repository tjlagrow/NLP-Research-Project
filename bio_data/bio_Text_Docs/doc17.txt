Abstract
Certain biological reactions such as receptor-ligand binding at cell-
cell interfaces and macromolecules binding to biopolymers require many
smaller molecules crowding a reaction site to be cleared Examples include
the T cell interface a key player in immunological information processing
Diusion sets a limit for such cavitation to occur spontaneously thereby
dening a timescale below which active mechanisms must take over We
consider N independent diusing particles in a closed domain contain-
ing a sub-region with N0 particles on average We investigate the time
until the sub-region is empty allowing a subsequent reaction to proceed
The rst passage time is computed using an ecient exact simulation
algorithm and an asymptotic approximation in the limit that cavitation
In this limit we nd that the mean rst passage time is sub-
is rare
exponential T  eN0 N 2
0  For the case of T cell receptors we nd that
stochastic cavitation is exceedingly slow 109 seconds at physiological den-
sities however can be accelerated to occur within 5 second with only a
four-fold dilution
Diusion drives many biological processes both positively by delivering
cargo to a target and negatively by removal of cargo from a region of in-
terest ROI While the temporal dynamics of diusional delivery have been
extensively studied 5 4 24 12 diusion-driven removal has been less charac-
terized experimentally or theoretically 3 Removal is of particular interest in
the crowded environment of cells where large biomolecules and cellular struc-
tures require the displacement of smaller molecules a phenomenon we term
stochastic cavitation
A specic example arises in the study of cell-cell interfaces including the
T-cellantigen-presenting-cell interface 22 2 29 8 see Fig 1 A fundamen-
tal question for all cell-cell interfaces is how receptors and ligands come into

contact despite being separated by large molecules the extracellular uid and
other structures in the glycocalyx On either cell surface large molecules such
as CD45 and LFA-1 undergo 2D diusion in the cell membrane with a diusion
coecient of D  01m2s 27 6 These large molecules impair interactions
between smaller pairs of molecules such as the T cell receptor and its liganda
key step in immunological information processing and decision-making It has
been estimated that a region of radius  100nm devoid of large molecules is
necessary for spontaneous T cell receptor interaction 2 which is occupied by
on average  30 particles at equilibrium A natural question is whether this
empty region can form spontaneously in a biologically relevant time Under-
standing contact formation will address cell-cell interactions in the crowded
heterogeneous environment inside organisms and what machinery is necessary
for general cell-cell interactions 15 31
Examples of diusional cavitation in biology also arise in other dimension-
alities
In 1D microtubules inexible polymers of the protein tubulin are
decorated by hundreds of microtubule-associated proteins 1 28 These pro-
teins exhibit signicant crowding 11 and lateral diusion along the microtubule
lattice 13 17 Large microtubule-binding molecules may therefore have to wait
for a region to be clear before binding What is the mean time for such clearance
and is it the rate-limiting step in microtubule binding A similar situation oc-
curs for DNA and the myriad of DNA-binding molecules some of which undergo
lateral diusion across base pairs 16 25 A signicant waiting-time for large
DNA-binding molecules has potential implications for the study of the chemical
modication of DNA and RNA all of which require an enzyme to attach to the
polymer
For some of the above scenarios it has been hypothesized that clearance of
the target region requires an active process 2 18 To address the feasibility
of passive diusion-driven cavitation a theoretical assessment of the timescales
involved is needed In other words can diusion-driven cavitation reliably oc-
cur on biologically relevant timescales To address this question we consider
N independent particles undergoing simple diusion in either the 1D domain

presenting cell CD45 molecules black block the receptor-ligand purple bond

L L or the 2D domain L L2 In each case we study the rst-passage
time until a smaller region a disk of radius L0 is empty
The cavitation event can be rare ie the rst passage time can be very
large compared to the diusion timescale L2D under certain circumstances
To understand this consider the 1D domain with N particles At equilibrium
each particle has a uniformly distributed postion within the domain
limit L   and N   with the average particle density   N2L
xed the equilibrium probability of nding a region of radius L0 containing no
particles is small P  eN0 where N0  2L Therefore when N0 cid29 1 we
expect cavitation to be a rare event Although we might expect the 1D mean
rst-passage time MFPT to scale as1 T  P 1  eN0 we instead we nd an
asymptotic scaling of T  eN0N 2
In this Letter we develop a simulation algorithm to eciently generate ex-
act realizations of the rst passage time based on Greens function reaction
dynamics 26 For situations where cavitation is a rare event and computa-
tion becomes unfeasible ie when N is very large or the ROI occupies most of
the explorable area we develop an asymptotic approximation of the mean rst
passage time
Consider N independent random walkers Ynt with n  1  N that are
conned to the interval L  y  L The ROI is the inner domain centered at
the origin with radius L0  L The event we wish to characterize is the rst time
at which the ROI is empty ie minnYnt  L0 We rst nondimensionalize
the problem using the space scale L and the time scale L2D where D is the
diusion coecient We dene the nondimensional distances Rn  Yn L
  1  L0L and l0  L0L Then a given particle is inside the ROI if
0  Rn  l0
By formulating a simulation algorithm we can generate exact samples of the
rst passage time We take advantage of explicit formulas for the probability dis-
tributions that govern single particle Brownian motion in a closed domain Note
that even though we focus on the 1D and 2D cavitation problem in this letter
exact distributions are also known for 3D Brownian motion 7 The algorithm
proceeds as follows Given a set of random starting positions Rnt01nN
select a particle that is inside the ROI and closest to the origin That is select
Rm  minRn  l0 The rst step is to compute the rst time  at which
the selected particle leaves the ROI ie Rmt0     l0 Once  has been
computed set tcid48  t0   The cavitation event cannot have occurred before
time tcid48 because we are certain that Rmt  l0 for all t0  t  tcid48 Therefore
the position of the other particles between time t0 and time tcid48 is irrelevant we
need only generate the random position for each of the remaining particles at
time tcid48 Once all positions have been updated select a new Rm  minRntcid48
We know that the cavitation event has occurred if Rm  l0 If Rm  l0 then
1This problem is equivalent to the diusion of a particle in N D dimensions the product
of number of particles and dimensionality of space Since N D cid29 2 this Brownian motion
is not recurrent so we might naively expect the system to be well-mixed in N D-dimensional
phase space and the rate of rst passage would be the attempt rate times the probability of
being in the target state
set t0  tcid48 and repeat the above procedure
At each step the jump times  can be sampled from the exact distribution
f r0 obtained from the fundamental solution to the diusion equation with
a reecting boundary at r  0 and an absorbing boundary at r  l0 The
random positions can be sampled from the distribution prr0   satisfying
the diusion equation with reecting boundaries at r  0 and r  1 An
ecient way of sampling from p is to use a rejection method similar to the
one described in 26 For the jump time sampled from f we found that the
rejection method could not easily be adapted to our situation
Instead we
sample the jump time using a root nding algorithm Additional details are
provided in Supplementary Material The simulation algorithm is maximally
fast in the sense that only the average slowest particle determines the next
event time allowing us to eciently access densities around L0  13 We nd
this is suciently high to validate our asymptotic approximations
To obtain a complete picture of cavitation in the rare event limits we develop
an asymptotic approximation for the MFPT T  The approximation is derived
for 1D cavitation and based on simulations we observe that in the limit L  
with a xed particle density the approximation is also surprisingly accurate for
2D cavitation We rst state the main results Eqs 46-37 and then summarize
their derivation
For xed N the rst term in the asymptotic approximation for 0   cid28 1
of the MFPT averaged over a uniformly distributed initial position for each of
the N particles is given by

The constant CN is the Newtonian capacitance of a hypercube in RN as ex-
plained below it determines the far eld behavior of certain solutions to Laplaces
equation 32 An explicit formula for the Newtonian capacitance of a cube for
N  2 is unknown However a good approximation for N  3 is C3  13214

pendently derived estimate for C3 from 19 From physical arguments detailed
at the end of this letter we have determined an expansion of the Newtonian
capacitance for large N given by

The unknown constant in the above expansion is independent of all parame-
ters Using the exact simulation algorithm we obtain the numerical estimate
2  167 Our MFPT calculation thus provides an approximation for the
capacitance CN which otherwise remains challenging to compute 19

Finally we consider the case the radius of the ROI L0 is xed and L  
with a xed number of particles per unit length   N2L Let N0 be the
average number of particles in the ROI The L   MFPT approximation in
dimensional units is

The approximation 37 matches closely with the LL0  333 simulations for
Figure 4 The MFPT vs N0 the average number of particles in the ROI The
symbols indicate 103 averaged simulations the 1D simulations are shown as cir-
cles and the 2D simulations are shown as diamonds Also shown is the L  
approximation dashed curve for both 1D and 2D Note that time is nondimen-
sional using the L2
0D timescale
N0  10 Hence the eect of a small domain size compared to the ROI is
to increase the MFPT making the cavitation event more rare This provides
a quantitative measure of when the domain size L no longer inuences the
cavitation event which is relevant when for example considering cavitation on
a relatively long strand of DNA compared to a shorter plasmid Microtubule
laments also vary in length
Simulations of 2D cavitation are also shown in Fig 4 as diamond symbols
Although the asymptotic approximation 37 is derived for 1D we nd that it is
a remarkably good t to the simulation data after changing a single parameter
the prefactor 2D  07 We therefore infer that cavitation is roughly three
times faster in 2D than in 1D Heuristically this speed-up occurs because the
mean time for a random walker to escape a spherical region decreases with
dimensionality
The asymptotic approximations 46-37 for 1D cavitation are derived as
follows Because all of the N walkers are independent the problem can be
reformulated as the rst passage time of a single random walker in a N di-
mensional domain Dene the domain   0 1N and let   1   1N
be the small target domain The random process Rt     represents

In order to access the rare event limit where both N cid29 1 and  cid28 1 we
must nd how the Newtonian capacitance CN scales with N This problem has
no known exact solution for N  2 19
If the cuboid boundary  were replaced by a spheroid with the same
hypervolume then the Newtonian capacitance is known for general N

is that there are no terms in the expansion between the leading order term and
the O1 term making our 1D approximation converge particularly fast This
feature is lacking in 2D where there are other terms singular in  therefore we
expect this approximation to converge more slowly In 2D for large L at con-
stant density a dierent scaling between N and L prevents the approximation
in 44 from converging necessitating an alternative strategy that will be the
subject of future research
Returning to the specic question of cell-cell contact at T cell interfaces
large diusing molecules such as CD45 disfavor proximity between receptors
and ligands on apposing cells These molecules have diusion coecients of
D  01m2s 27 and density such that on average there are N0  30 molecules
in the 100-nanometer ROI 2 The approximation 37 using the prefactor
2D  07 from the numerical t to simulations yields an estimate of T 
109 seconds In contrast the MFPT for a single particle to escape a circular
domain is T  L2
04D  0025 seconds Since T cell receptor triggering
occurs within seconds 14 the above calculation predicts that receptor-ligand
binding must involve a mechanism faster than passive diusion We therefore
suggest the alternative hypothesis that an active force drives receptor-ligand
proximity 2 To obtain an empty ROI spontaneously in less than ve seconds
we would require N0  7 corresponding to a four-fold dilution which could be
experimentally accessible The biological system is complicated by interactions
of large molecules within and between molecular species lipid heterogeneity
and transient immobilization all of which could be exploited to dynamically
tune the rate of ligand binding and will be studied by expanding the present
framework

For 2D cavitation the outer boundary is a square of side length 2L This
geometry allows us to reuse the jump propagator from the 1D algorithm to
update positions The x and y coordinate of each particle are updated from
separate samples of the 1D propagator pr as described in the previous section
