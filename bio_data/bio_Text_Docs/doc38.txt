Abstract
We discuss the formation of graded morphogen proles in a cell layer by nonlinear transport
phenomena important for patterning developing organisms We focus on a process termed tran-
scytosis where morphogen transport results from binding of ligands to receptors on the cell surface
incorporation into the cell and subsequent externalization Starting from a microscopic model we
derive eective transport equations We show that in contrast to morphogen transport by extra-
cellular diusion transcytosis leads to robust ligand proles which are insensitive to the rate of
ligand production
An essential feature during the development of an organism is the emergence of dierent
cell types This process called cell dierentiation is intimately linked to the position of the
cells in the organism About fty years ago Turing suggested the existence of molecules
that provide positional information for dierentiating cells 1 Turing proposed that these
morphogens self-organize into patterns which structure the future organism Pattern for-
mation based on reaction diusion systems has been studied extensively 2 3 4 Today
a number of proteins have been identied to act as morphogens In contrast to Turings
original suggestion morphogens are secreted from a spatially localized source and form a
stable long-ranged concentration gradient in the adjacent tissue 5 There cells detect
the morphogen by receptors located on the cell surface and respond with patterns of gene
expression that depend on the morphogen concentration In this way cell fate depends on
the distance from the morphogen source and the interplay of several morphogen gradients
originating from spatially distinct sources leads to the complex patterning of developing
organisms For this to be possible the gene expression patterns must be formed with high
precision and also need to be robust ie they should not depend sensitively on parame-
ters that are likely to uctuate Robust gene expression can result from the robustness of
the morphogen concentration gradient 6 7 or can be achieved by other mechanisms 8
Interestingly dierent species use very similar morphogens and a given species can use the
same morphogen at dierent stages during development An example are morphogens of
the TGF- super-family which exist in a wide range of organisms ranging from the fruit y
Drosophila to humans
The formation of morphogen gradients is still poorly understood
In particular it is
not clear how morphogens are transported in the tissue adjacent to the source Several
possibilities have been proposed Secreted morphogen molecules might simply diuse in the
extracellular space between cells 9 and for some morphogens this indeed seems to be the
dominant form of transport 10 However there is growing experimental evidence against
simple diusion for several morphogens 11 12 Other transport mechanisms that have
been proposed include the bucket brigade where molecules are handed over from one cell
to adjacent cells 13 or transport by cell displacements in the tissue 14
Another possibility is suggested by recent experiments on the morphogen Dpp 11 Dpp
belongs to the TGF- super family and patterns the developing wing discs of Drosophila
The wing disc is a sheet formed from one layer of cells that is the precursor of a wing Fluo-
rescently labeled Dpp was tracked in wing discs where it is secreted by a narrow strip of cells
from where it spreads into the adjacent tissue If all cells adjacent to the secreting cells are
defective in the internalization of the morphogen into the cell Dpp gradients extend only
about two cells from the source as compared to 30 cells in a non-mutant y If only cells in
a small patch close to the source show this defect a pronounced transient depletion of the
morphogen is observed behind the mutant patch during gradient formation This suggests
that Dpp is not simply diusing through the extracellular space It has been suggested that
these observations can be described by a scenario where Dpp diuses in the extracellular
space binds to and is released from receptors 15 However an analysis which takes into
account more recent experimental results indicates that free diusion alone cannot account
for the observations 16 An alternative suggestion is that long range transport of Dpp is
generated by transcytosis ie by repeated rounds of morphogen binding to cell surface re-
ceptors internalization into the cell and subsequent externalization and release of the ligand
from the receptor at a dierent point on the cell surface 17 A simple model to describe
transcytosis is illustrated in Fig 1 Ligands spread from a stripe of secreting cells into a
two-dimensional tissue However in many situations a one-dimensional description of ligand
proles as a function of the distance x to the source is appropriate 15 16 Transcytosis can
be characterized by rates kon and ko for receptor binding and unbinding of free ligands as
well as bint and bext for internalization and externalization of ligand-bound receptors Inter-
nalized morphogens are degraded with rate bdeg The free diusion of ligands in the narrow
space between cells is characterized by the diusion coecient D0 Diusion alone does not
lead to ecient long-range transport if the diusion length d  D0edeg12 is smaller than
one or several cell diameters Here edeg is the extracellular degradation rate
On scales large compared to the cell diameter a this model together with the assumption
that receptors are also synthesized and degraded in the cells leads to eective transport
equations for the number densities t x of morphogens and t x of receptors given by
t  xD x  D x  k 
t  syn   deg  
Here D  is an eective diusion coecient and k  an eective degradation rate
that depend on both the ligand and receptor concentrations Furthermore a term exists
which describes ligand currents induced by gradients of the receptor concentration We
assume for simplicity that cells are non-polar such that externalization occurs with equal
probability at any place on the cell surface As a consequence the resulting transport is
non-directional The kinetics of the receptor density is characterized by eective source and
sink terms syn  and deg  The dependences of the eective diusion coecient
D the degradation rate k the coecients D syn and deg on the ligand and receptor
concentrations can be calculated explicitly 18 In order to keep our discussion simple we
focus here on the case where the surface receptor number per cell R is maintained constant
Then ligand transport is described by a single nonlinear diusion equation
t  xDx  k 
Explicit expressions of D and k are given in 22 The coecients are displayed as
functions of the ligand concentration  in Fig

with c1  abintkor4kon where r  Ra The eective diusion coecient D decreases
for large ligand concentration because receptors are increasingly occupied and not available
for transport A maximum of D occurs for intermediate values of  if the ligand binding
rate kon exceeds a critical value This implies that for small  D increases for increasing
 Similarly the eective degradation rate exhibits for large  the asymptotic behavior

We solve Eq 3 for x  0 representing the space adjacent to the ligand source and with
boundary conditions jx  0  j0 and j  0 for large x Here j0 is proportional to the
rate of ligand secretion in the source In this situation a graded ligand prole is generated
and maintained in the steady state see Fig 3
The eect of the source is captured by the boundary condition on the current j  j0 at
x  0 where j  Dx see Eq 3 If initially at time t  0 ligand is absent   0
the ligand spreads for t  0 into the region x  0 and builds up a gradient In the steady
state the total ligand concentration decreases monotonically with increasing distance from
the source The steady state satises xj  k  0 and is reached on a time scale of the
order of 1k  0 The corresponding ligand distribution x obeys

where the ligand current j in the steady state is given by

For small  the ligand prole decays as   expx with   D0k012 In the
case D0  0 the steady state prole has a singularity at x  x

Choosing j0  0 ensures x  0 such that x is not physically accessible This singularity
results from the asymptotic behavior of the current j for large   T  j2  jT 2 
2edegc1 lnT   2c1c21T  1 Here T denotes a characteristic ligand concentration
beyond which the limit of large ligand concentration holds Therefore the current diverges
as j2  2c1edeg ln  Note that for edeg  0 the current reaches for large  a nite maximal
value jmax and the corresponding steady state ligand prole diverges as   c1jmaxxx
The singular behavior of the steady state prole near x  x has remarkable consequences
for the robustness of gradient formation Such a robustness can be quantied by an appro-
priate response function of the system 6 We dene the robustness Rj0  aj0j0x1
where the function x is given by Eq 4 It becomes large if changes of j0 have little
inuence on the ligand prole in the steady state Here a robustness of R  1 implies that
under a 100 increase of j0 the position at which the ligand prole attains any xed value
is displaced by about one cell diameter a Thus for R  1 cells in the target tissue cannot
detect variations of the ligand concentration due to signicant changes of j0 while for R  1
the steady state prole is strongly aected see Fig 3 Note that R is independent of 
Indeed R can be rewritten as
R  aj0j0x1  a0j0D0  ak00j0
where 0  x  0 and Eqs 4 and 5 have been used The robustness is thus completely
determined by the ratio of the eective degradation rate and the ligand current at x  0
High degradation rates and small currents lead to a robust gradient Using the asymptotic
behavior of the steady state prole for D0  0 we nd that the robustness increases rapidly
for large currents j0 as R  j 1
c  12c1edeg For small j0 R  a becomes

constant
The situation is dierent if D0 is nite In this case both k and D are nonvanishing
and constant for large  and consequently Eq 3 becomes linear in this limit The steady
state prole for   c1D0 behaves as   expxd In the interval T    c1D0 the
ligand prole is well described by Eq 6 while for small   T    expx As a
consequence of nite D0 the robustness approaches a nite value Rmax  ad for large j0
For d  a this implies R  1 for large j0 and cells in the target tissue are insensitive to
variations of j0 by a factor of two The robustness is displayed in Fig 4 as a function of j0
for dierent values of da
Finally we briey discuss how the transport Eq 3 is derived from a microscopic model
We denote the number of free ligands in the space between cell n and n  1 by Ln and the
numbers of receptor bound ligands inside cell n by Si
n  Similarly we introduce the numbers
n and Sl
see Fig 1 The dynamics of these quantities is given by

comparison of the full solutions of Eqs 8-11 to Eq 3 is shown in Fig 3 demonstrating
that the eective transport Eq 3 captures the behavior of the microscopic model
In conclusion we have developed a general theoretical framework for ligand transport
and the generation of characteristic ligand proles via transcytosis Cell dierentiation is
triggered at threshold levels of morphogen concentration The robustness of patterning has
been demonstrated experimentally under conditions where Dpp was overexpressed 11 16
19 Reliable patterning can be achieved by robustly generating morphogen proles We
have dened the robustness of steady state ligand proles with respect to the rate of ligand
secretion j0 We nd that transcytosis naturally leads to a large robustness of the prole
Free extracellular diusion reduces robustness signicantly if the diusion length d exceeds
several cell sizes The origin of robustness in transcytosis are nonlinearities in the ligand
current A similar mechanism based on nonlinear degradation alone permits the robust
formation of gradients in a free diusion model 6 Robustness can also be achieved by
other nonlinear eects 7
In the general case where both ligand and receptor densities are taken into account new
phenomena appear 18 In particular ligand currents can be driven by receptor gradients
Furthermore ligand gradients are accompanied by a gradient in the receptor density as is
indeed observed experimentally 11 20 In addition if cells posess a polarity and dene a
direction in the tissue transcytosis can lead to directed transport Finally it is straightfor-
ward to generalize the concepts presented here to higher dimensions
The eects discussed here become important if the diusion length d is smaller than the
range   30a of the gradient From experiments where endocytosis has been blocked in
the target tissue we estimate d  2a 11 The rates of transcytosis have to be suciently
large to guarantee gradient formation within the experimentally observed times of about
k01 8 hours Assuming that the rates konR ko bint and bext are of the order of 1min
we estimate D  a2min This diusion coecient is sucient to generate a gradient over
a length   30a during 8 hours Numerical solutions to the transcytosis model see Fig 3
conrm this estimate A rate of one per minute is larger than values measured in dierent
but related systems 21 but is plausible for intracellular tracking
The values of the rate constants are dicult to measure while the eective diusion coef-
cient and the eective degradation rates are more easily accessible in uorescence recovery
experiments Our work suggests that if transcytosis dominates transport morphogen gra-
dients are robust with respect to morphogen overexpression This can be directly tested in
future experiments
