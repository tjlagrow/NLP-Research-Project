Abstract Cells in multicellular organisms adhere to the extracellular matrix through two-dimensional
clusters spanning a size range from very few to thousands of adhesion bonds For many common receptor-
ligand systems the ligands are tethered to a surface via polymeric spacers with nite binding range thus
adhesion cluster stability crucially depends on receptor-ligand distance We introduce a one-step master
equation which incorporates the eect of cooperative binding through a nite number of polymeric ligand
tethers We also derive Fokker-Planck and mean eld equations as continuum limits of the master equation
Polymers are modeled either as harmonic springs or as worm-like chains In both cases we nd bistability
between bound and unbound states for intermediate values of receptor-ligand distance and calculate the
corresponding switching times For small cluster sizes stochastic eects destabilize the clusters at large
separation as shown by a detailed analysis of the stochastic potential resulting from the Fokker-Planck
equation

1 Introduction
Cells adhere to the extracellular matrix or to each other
through a multitude of weak interactions The transient
character of their adhesions allows cells to adapt quickly
to changes in their environment In particular cell adhe-
sion has to be transiently down-regulated during impor-
tant physiological processes like migration or division For
tissue cells the main receptors for cell-matrix adhesion
are integrins which are linked on the extracellular side to
ligands like bronectin and on the cytoplasmic side to the
actin cytoskeleton 1 This provides structural integrity
between extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton which is
important because cell-matrix adhesion clusters usually
have to operate under considerable mechanical load The
behaviour of single receptor-ligand bonds under force was
rst discussed by Bell 2 who suggested that bond life-
time is reduced exponentially by an applied load This
concept has been impressively conrmed and extended
by dynamic force spectroscopy 34567 which showed
that binding strength can only be dened in a dynamical
context In particular it has been shown both theoreti-
cally and experimentally that for linearly increasing load
binding strength increases linearly with the logarithm of
loading rate If loading occurs through a soft polymeric
linker binding strength is decreased compared to load-
ing at the same speed but through a rigid linker 8 In
practise cell adhesion does not work with single bonds
but with clusters of bonds It has been noted earlier that

Physics Kruislaan 407 1098 SJ Amsterdam The Netherlands
the distribution of load over the receptors in a nite-sized
cluster induces non-trivial cooperativity between adhesion
bonds as one bond is disrupted the load on the remain-
ing bonds increases and cluster stability diminishes 29
1011 Likewise as a new bond is established the other
bonds feel less force and cluster stability is enhanced
For many common receptor-ligand systems the lig-
ands are tethered to a surface through polymeric spac-
ers This reduces the disturbance of ligand structure to
preserve its specicity and allows exploration of space
for receptors so that the eective anity of surfaces cov-
ered with specic bonds is increased For example it has
been shown recently in a macroscopic shearing experiment
for streptavidin-biotin bonded beads that bonding is en-
hanced if ligands are tethered with polymeric spacers 12
Thus the distance between ligands and receptors is an im-
portant determinant for specic adhesion When cells ad-
here to and eventually spread on a surface the distance be-
tween the ligand- and receptor-carrying surfaces decreases
from the m- to the nm-range on the time scale of minutes
13 The nal receptor-ligand distance for integrins is of
the order of 15  20 nm which is bridged by the polymer
spacer carrying the ligand
During recent years the distance-dependent binding of
tethered ligands has been investigated experimentally as
well as theoretically In experiments using the surface force
apparatus and high-anity streptavidin-biotin bonds 14
15 it has been shown that binding depends on rare strongly
extended conformations of the spacers and that the onset
of binding is followed by a very fast increase of the fraction
of bound tethers Binding of tethered ligands to receptors
Thorsten Erdmann Ulrich S Schwarz Impact of receptor-ligand distance on adhesion cluster stability
has been described using a combination of Monte Carlo
simulations and reaction-diusion theory Simulations of
pearl-bead chains conned between two walls were used
to determine the force-extension relation for the polymers
and to derive a potential landscape for the movement of
the ligands Later reversibel tethered bonds have been
treated as deep but nite potential wells in the polymer
potential landscape derived from simulations and used in
the reaction-diusion equations 1617 Moreover the ef-
fect of changing receptor-ligand distance with a prescribed
velocity has been discussed It was concluded that kinetic
eects are most important for strong binders with large
anity while thermodynamic equilibrium dominates for
weak reversible binders with small anity Recently a
theoretical treatment has also been given for receptor-
ligand binding between curved surfaces where dierent
bonds are not equivalent for geometrical reasons 18
It is important to note that these theoretical stud-
ies have been conducted in the framework of a mean-
eld description for a large numbers of independent non-
cooperative bonds No theoretical treatment has been pre-
sented yet for the impact of receptor-ligand distance on
the stability and dynamics of nite-sized clusters with co-
operative bonds Experimentally it is well known that the
lateral arrangement of the integrins and therefore the in-
tegrin cluster size is regulated by cytoplasmic proteins like
talin and -actinin which can bind both to the integrins
and to the actin cytoskeleton 19 Using image correlation
microscopy it has been shown for migrating cells that the
integrins which are not yet organized in adhesions are al-
ready preclustered with an average cluster size of three to
four 20 With a measured area density of few hundreds
of integrins per m2 this corresponds to a lateral distance
well above 100 nm between the dierent mini-clusters As
the adhesion contacts nucleate and grow integrins are in-
creasingly clustered until they approach a density of 1000
- 10000 per m2 corresponding to a lateral distance of 10
- 30 nm The progression from very few to thousands of in-
tegrins per cluster suggests that nite size eects might be
highly relevant in the stabilization of initial cell adhesion
In this paper we theoretically study the eect of feed-
back and cooperativity on the distance-dependent receceptor-
ligand binding dynamics in nite-sized adhesion clusters
To this end we use a one-step master equation which has
been used before to study the adhesion cluster stability
under mechanical load both for constant force 1121 and
linearly rising force 22 Here we extend this framework
to include the eect of receptor-ligand distance We start
in Sec 2 by introducing the appropriate one-step master
equation In addition we derive two corresponding contin-
uum descriptions namely a Fokker-Planck equation and a
deterministic dierential mean eld equation Our mod-
eling framework can be used for any spatial distribution
of the ligand in the direction normal to the substrate to
which it is tethered For simplicity we start with a har-
monic tether potential spring model  which is the rst
order approximation for all polymer models at small ex-
tensions In Sec 3 we analyze the stationary states of the
mean eld equation and derive one-parameter bifurcation
diagrams which show that the receptor-ligand dynamics of
adhesion clusters leads to bistability between bound and
unbound states In Secs 5 and 6 we discuss stationary
and dynamic properties of the master equation respec-
tively In particular we nd that large adhesion clusters
are stabilized in the bound state due to very large switch-
ing times to the unbound state In Sec 7 we combine our
conceptual framework with the worm-like chain model for
semiexible polymers to study the eect of nite poly-
mer contour length We conclude in Sec 8 by discussing
some biological applications of our results A short report
on our main results regarding the spring model has been
given before 23
2 Model
21 Master equation and continuum limits
Fig 1 shows a schematic representation of our model for
an adhesion cluster The mechanical properties of the force
transducer holding the receptors and of the polymeric
tethers holding the ligands are represented by harmonic
springs We consider a situation in which Nt receptor-
ligand pairs are arranged in parallel between the planar
force transducer and the substrate At a given time each
of these adhesion bonds can either be open or closed All
bonds are considered to be equivalent so that the state
of the adhesion cluster is characterized by the number of
closed bonds i alone The number of open bonds is Nt  i
Because i ranges from i  0 completely unbound state to
i  Nt completely bound state our model has Nt1 dis-
crete states Every bond changes its state rebinds or rup-
tures through thermally activated stochastic transitions
The stochastic rates for these transitions will be specied
below Therefore the stochastic variable i changes by dis-
crete steps 1 one-step process The time dependence of
the functions pitNt
i0 representing the probability that
i bonds are closed at time t are described by a one-step
master equation which has the general form
 ri1pi1  gi1pi1  ri  gi pi 
The forward rates gi for the formation and the reverse
rates ri for the rupture of a closed bond have to be speci-
ed for all states 0  i  Nt They have the general form
ri  ikof f i and gi  Nt  ikoni The reverse rate is
the product of the number of closed bonds and the sin-
gle bond o-rate kof f i because the closed bonds rupture
independently and at a given time any of them could be
the next to break The forward rate is the product of the
number of open bonds Nt  i and the single bond on-
rate koni because the open bonds are independent and
any one of them could be the next to bind Both o- and
on-rate will in general depend on i The form of the tran-
sition rates implies that the system is constrained to the
interval 0  i  Nt by two natural reecting boundaries
at i  0 and i  Nt provided the single bond rates are
nite at these boundaries

deformation in regard to the average cell-substrate distance b Simple mechanical model for a site of adhesion The cluster
consists of Nt bonds here Nt  5 At a given time t i of these bonds are closed here 3 while Nt  i here 2 are open
The force transducer at the top cell envelope and the ligand tethers at the bottom are modeled as harmonic springs with
rest lengths t and b and spring constants kt and kb respectively The equilibrium positions of the springs dashed lines are
separated by the receptor-ligand distance  The extensions of the bond springs and the transducer are denoted by xb and
xt    xb respectively
If the transition rates are continuous functions of i
that is gi  gi and ri  ri it is useful to introduce
a mean-eld description for the average number of closed
i1 ipit The time derivative of
N t follows from the master equation Eq 1 in terms of
averages over the transition rates Dragging the average
into the argument it can be approximated as
bonds N t  hii  PNt
 hgiihrii  ghiirhii  gN rN   2
This procedure yields an ordinary dierential equation for
N which in the following we term the mean eld equation
It is an exact equation for the mean number of bonds N
if the transition rates are linear functions in i Otherwise
it is only valid in the limit of large system size Nt
To assess the role of uctuations in the continuum
limit we derive a Fokker-Planck equation from the mas-
ter equation To achieve this the one-step master equation
Eq 1 is written in operator form 24
in which the Kramers-Moyal coecients are dened by
Ai  gi  ri
and Di  gi  ri 
The Kramers-Moyal expansion Eq 6 is an exact contin-
uum representation of the master equation Terminating
the innite series after second order yields the Fokker-

By deriving the dierential equations for average and vari-
ance directly from the master equation one can verify that
the left hand sides are the derivatives dNdt and d2dt
for the initial conditions N t0  it0 and 2t0  0 at
time t  t0 2421 The Fokker-Planck equation thus de-
scribes the average and the variance correctly However
the centered moments of higher order are not correctly
represented due to the truncation procedure
In general a continuous description of a one-step pro-
cess through the mean eld equation Eq 2 or the Fokker-
Planck equation Eq 8 will be valid if the variation of
transition rates and probability distribution is small over
the step size i  1 Below we will use the mean eld
equation for a bifurcation analysis in order to demonstrate
that our system is bistable Because the Fokker-Planck
equation results from a truncated Kramers-Moyal expan-
sion it cannot be used to describe the full dynamics For a
Thorsten Erdmann Ulrich S Schwarz Impact of receptor-ligand distance on adhesion cluster stability
bistable system it has been shown before that the diusion
approximation Eq 8 leads to an error in the stationary
probability distribution and an overestimation of the tran-
sition rates between the coexisting states 26 However
this error is small for suciently smooth transition rates
Moreoever the extrema of the stationary distribution are
correctly described by the diusion approximation of the
Fokker-Planck equation as used here Therefore we will
use it below to investigate how the stationary states are
aected by thermal uctuations which are not included in
the mean eld approximation In order to describe the full
stochastic dynamics we will use the original master equa-
tion Eq 1 Alternatively an improved Fokker-Planck de-
scription could be used as explained in Ref 26
22 Transition rates
221 Reverse rate
The bond dissociation dynamics is characterized by the re-
verse rate ri and strongly depends on the forces acting
in the cluster We start with the simplest possible model
as suggested by the cartoon in Fig 1 that is the trans-
ducer and ligand tethers are modeled as harmonic springs
with rest lengths t and b and spring constants kt and kb
respectively Because the receptors are usually rmly at-
tached to the actin cytoskeleton deformation of the trans-
ducer requires a local deformation of the whole cell mem-
brane as shown in the cartoon of Fig 1a Therefore the
stiness kt of the transducer is the combined stiness of
plasma membrane and cell cortex The extensions xb for
a bound ligand and xt for the transducer satisfy the rela-
tion xb  xt   where  is the receptor-ligand distance in
the completely dissociated state In the following we will
treat the relaxed or unloaded receptor-ligand distance  as
a parameter which has been xed externally eg by the
average cell-substrate distance or in an experiment with
the surface forces apparatus Mechanical equilibrium re-

The dissociation rate of a bond under force is described by
the Bell model as kof f  k0 exp FbF0 where k0 is the
unstressed o-rate and F0 is the bonds internal force scale
2 The Bell model can be rationalized in the framework of
Kramers theory for the escape over a sharp energy barrier
3 The reverse rate ri for the one-step master equation
now follows as
ri  ik0 exp FbiF0 
When a bond ruptures force is redistributed according to
Eq 12 over the smaller number of bonds so that the
load on the remaining bonds increases As a consequence
the extension of the remaining tethers increases which in-
creases the force even further A decrease of the number
of closed bonds thus increases the o-rate for the single
bonds and makes rupture of a further bond more likely
Thus the reverse rate from Eq 13 describes a positive
feedback mechanism for rupture which results from coop-
erativity in load sharing
222 Forward rate
The bond association dynamics is characterized by the for-
ward rate gi and is strongly determined by the receptor-
ligand distance which has to be bridged for the formation
of a new bond In the cartoon of Fig 1 the ligands are at-
tached to springs and can move between the ligand-coated
surface at the bottom and the transducer surface at the
top Hence they move in a truncated harmonic potential
which is

Here erf x  2R

tion The binding process can conceptually be divided into
two steps First ligand and receptor have to come su-
ciently close to form an encounter complex 27282930
Second this entangled state has to react to form the -
nal complex For a stationary distribution of tethers the
rst step is limited by xb the probability of the lig-
and to be close to the transducer surface The second step
is described by the on-rate kon for the case that ligand
and receptor are suciently close within the binding ra-
dius bind The forward rate gi for the one-step master
equation Eq 1 thus reads
gi  konNt  ixb 
When an open bond rebinds force is redistributed over
the larger number of bonds according to Eq 12 and the
load on the single bonds decreases This reduces the ex-
tension of the bound tethers and increases the density of
free ligands close to the transducer An increase of the
number of closed bonds thus increases the on-rate for the
single bonds and makes rebinding of a further bond more
likely Thus the forward rate from Eq 17 describes a pos-
itive feedback mechanism for binding which results from
cooperativity in the formation of encounter complexes
23 Adiabatic assumption
In the derivation of reverse and forward rates it was as-
sumed that relaxation of transducer and polymer tethers
Thorsten Erdmann Ulrich S Schwarz Impact of receptor-ligand distance on adhesion cluster stability
to mechanical equilibrium after a change in i is fast com-
pared to rupture and rebinding of adhesion bonds This
assumption is a prerequisite for the denition of discrete
states described by the number of closed bonds alone and
hence for the validity of the master equation Experimen-
tally it has been found for a biomembrane force probe that
the damping time for the system with tethered bonds is
on the order of 103 s 31 which is typically at least
one order of magnitude smaller than the transition times
for adhesion bonds 32 The polymer relaxation time is
determined by the Zimm time 33 For a Flory chain it
is Z  R3
F kBT where  is the viscosity of the sur-
rounding uid RF is the Flory radius RF  aN 06 with
Kuhn length a and number of Kuhn segments N  The
viscosity of water is on the order of   103Pa s For
polymers with RF  10 nm and for kBT  4 pN nm one
has Z  107s This result agrees with earlier estimates
for polyethylene glycol chains 141618 The very fast
relaxation time scale for the polymers allows us to use a
stationary density distribution for the ligands
24 Dimensionless parameters
The master equation Eq 1 together with Eqs 13 and
12 for the reverse rate and Eqs 17 16 and 15 for
the forward rate completely species our model For the
following it is useful to introduce dimensionless quanti-
ties First we introduce dimensionless time   k0t Then
we non-dimensionalize all distances by writing them in
units of the unstressed ligand tether length b The di-
mensionless relaxed ligand-receptor distance is denoted
by   b We also introduce   kbkt the ratio of
the spring constants of bonds and transducer and  
kbbF0 the force in units of F0 that is necessary to ex-
tend a ligand tether spring by b ie to twice its unstressed
length Then the reverse rate reads
ri  i exp 1  i  i exp i 
where i  1i has been introduced as an abbrevi-
ation for the extension of the tethers receptor-ligand dis-
tance with i closed bonds Regarding the association pro-
cess we dene the dimensionless on-rate   konk0bindb
which is weighted with the ratio of binding radius bind
and unstressed tether length b and the inverse thermal
energy kBT non-dimensionalised by the tether energy at
an extension equal to their rest length   kb2
b2kBT 
Then the forward rate reads
Our model now contains six dimensionless parameters
The number of receptor-ligand pairs is given by the clus-
ter size Nt The conditional rebinding rate  describes
the rate of binding with a at density distribution in-
nite temperature on an interval of length b The relative
stiness of the tethers   kbkt implies the two limits of
   soft transducer and   0 sti transducer In
the following we will use the intermediate case   1 The
dimensionless force constant  measures the force needed
to stretch the tethers to twice their unstressed length in
units of the intrinsic force scale of the adhesion bonds
For an entropic spring this essentially scales as the ratio
of two length scales the bond reactive compliance kBT F0
and the rest length of the tethers In practice it will have a
rather small value and in the following we use   01 The
mobility of the ligands is represented by the inverse ligand
temperature  In the limits of soft transducer   
and very high ligand temperature   0 our model
simplies to a case which we have studied before in order
to assess adhesion cluster stability under force 1121 In
this paper we rather focus on the role of ligand-receptor
distance  which in combination with the dierent spring
constants replaces the dimensionless force f used in the
earlier model In experimental setups  is certainly the
most accessible parameter The parameters and their def-
inition are summarized in Tab I There we also give the
typical range of parameters which was used for calcula-
tions and some estimates for the integrin-bronectin sys-
3 Bifurcation analysis of the mean eld
equation
To analyze the stationary solutions of the mean eld equa-
tion we rst consider the dependence of the reverse rate
rN  from Eq 18 and the forward rate gN  from Eq 19
on the number of closed bonds N and on the model pa-
rameters Stationary solutions are the xed points of the
Eq 2 and correspond to intersections of rN  and gN 
because then the time derivative dNd  gN   rN 
vanishes Fig 2a plots rN  and gN  as function of N
for dierent values of the relaxed receptor-ligand distance
 The single bond o-rate kof f N   exp 1  N 
is nite at N  0 thus r0  0 With increasing N  the
reverse rate rN  increases almost linearly although the
single bond o-rate is a monotonous decreasing function of
N  The weak inuence of the exponential o-rate kof f N 
is mainly due to the small force constant   01 the en-
tropic tether force does not suce to accelerate bond rup-
ture appreciably For larger  the reverse rate increases
quickly from r0  0 and can have a local maximum
and minimum at small N  For large N the linear term
dominates in any case Alternatively non-monotonous be-
havior could be induced by a large  that is for a soft
transducer The forward rate gN  vanishes for N  Nt
goes through a maximum at intermediate N and then de-
creases At N  0 the forward rates is always positive and
approaches zero only in the limit of innite  or  At

With the denition of these dimensionless rates the dy-
namical equations that is master equation mean eld
equation and Fokker-Planck equation have the same form
as in Eqs 1 2 and 8 but with time derivatives in 
rather than t Since reverse rate Eq 18 and forward rate
Eq 19 are both non-linear in i the mean eld equation
for N is only valid for large system size

N and small  the time derivative has a maximum which
reects the maximum of gN  before it becomes negative
at large N where the reverse rate dominates The xed
point at large N is stable and represents the bound state
of the adhesion cluster containing a large number of closed
bonds For intermediate  there are three xed points in-
cluding two stable xed points at large N bound state
and N  0 unbound state The two stable xed points
are separated by an unstable one At large  there is only
one stable unbound state which approaches N  0 in the
limit of large 
Fig 3 summarizes the behavior of the xed points in
the form of two one-parameter bifurcation diagrams which
show the xed points as function of  and  respectively
At small separation a single stable xed point exists at
large N  Here the adhesion cluster is bound because the
force on the bonds is small and the density of free ligands
close to the receptor is large therefore rupture events are
rare and can be balanced by rebinding With increasing
 the force on the bonds increases and the number of
closed bonds in the bound state decreases At large 
there is a single stable xed point at N  0 Here the
adhesion cluster is unbound because forces are large and
ligand density at the receptors is small so that rupture
events occur frequently and cannot be balanced by re-
binding The transition from bound to unbound proceeds
via two saddle-node bifurcations At small  the stable
unbound xed point appears together with an unstable
xed point separating the stable ones The unstable xed
point merges with the bound stable xed point at larger 
In the window of bistability between the two bifurcations
two stable xed points coexist The position of this win-
dow moves to smaller  with increasing  The bifuraction
behavior as function of the inverse ligand temperature 
is qualitatively similar although the position of the stable
bound state initially increases with  because the forward
rate initially increases With decreasing  the position of
the bistable range shifts to larger  while its width in-
creases strongly
In Fig 4 we construct a stability diagram which iden-
ties the region of bistability as a function of  and  The
positions of the bifurcation delineating the bistable region
were determined numerically For large  the width of the
interval in  stays almost constant while the position de-
creases slowly which explains the very large bistable range

For the lower bifurcation one can use the approximate cri-
terion that the slope of dNd with respect to N has to
become negative Neglecting rN  one is left with the
condition dgN dN  0 at N  0 For large   1 one

two curves eventually converge and bistability vanishes
The stability diagram can be regarded as the projection
of the cusp-like surface of the xed points on the  
plane For large clusters and also for larger on-rates  the
curves will meet at negative  and bistability persist for
positive 
In the framework of biochemical control of biological
systems bistability is commonly associated with an un-
derlying positive feedback mechanism 34 In our case
bistability can arise from two positive feedback mecha-
nisms as described above First there is positive feedback
for bond rupture as one bond breaks the force on the
remaining bonds increases thus increasing their dissocia-
tion rate Second there is positive feedback for binding as
one ligand binds a receptor the receptor-ligand distance
is decreased and the binding rate for the other ligands is
increased In general we veried that in our model both
mechanisms can lead to bistability However for the pa-
rameter range chosen here it is only the positive feedback
of binding which is responsible for the observed bistability
As shown in Fig 2 the reverse rate rN  increases almost
linearly for the set of parameters chosen The forward rate
gN  on the other hand is non-monotonous Thus for the
parameter range chosen here the positive feedback under-
lying bistability is mostly due to the forward rate gN

42 Stochastic potential
The stationary probability distribution Eq 20 can be
used to dene an energy landscape Ei by
Ei   log P si 
The extrema of this potential are determined by the con-
dP si

dP si
With Eq 22 for the rst derivative of the distribution
the position of the extrema of the stochastic potential Ei
are thus determined by
Ai 
Di  0 
These extrema have a similar physical meaning as the
xed points of the mean eld equation but they are more
rigorous in including thermal uctuations In the frame-
work of the stochastic potential bistability requires a bi-
modal potential landscape in which two minima of the
stochastic potential coexist The coexisting minima max-
ima of the probability distribution are separated by a
potential barrier minimum of the probability distribu-
tion The separated peaks of the probability distribution
in these minima are commonly referred to as macrostates
of the stochastic system because they are possible real-
izations of a macroscopic deterministic system One can
regard the extrema as the xed points of the dynamical

This is the mean eld equation corrected for the eects
of non-homogeneous mobility Eq 27 allows to deter-
mine extrema in the same way as the xed points of the
mean eld equation in the previous section For a con-
stant diusion coecient the xed points are identical to
the extrema of the stochastic potential Non-homogeneous
diusion terms change the position of xed point and can
even destroy xed points or create new ones noise-induced
transitions 35
43 Bifurcation analysis
Using the stochastic dynamic system the topology of the
stochastic potential can be analyzed just as the mean eld
equation by deriving bifurcation diagrams showing the po-
sitions of the macrostates the extrema of the potential
as function of the model parameters The extrema are de-
termined as stable and unstable xed points of Eq 27
Fig 5 shows these stochastic bifurcation diagrams as func-
tion of receptor-ligand distance  in comparison to those
from the mean eld equation For suciently small 
the upper stable xed point of the deterministic equation
agrees well with a bound macrostate at large N in the
stochastic potential The saddle-node bifurcation in which
the bound macrostate vanishes occurs at much smaller
separation  than in the deterministic picture thus uc-
tuations destabilize the adhesion cluster The minimum of
the stochastic potential lies above the unstable determin-
istic xed point and becomes negative at small  For pos-
itive i the stochastic potential has no second minimum
but it has a boundary minimum at i  0 This second
macrostate corresponds to the unbound xed point of the
mean eld equation For larger clusters the agreement be-
tween the xed points of the stochastic potential and the
mean eld equation improves In the limit of very large
clusters the two solution approach each other as shown
in Fig 6 for Nt  100 and 250 In this case the unbound
state is practically indistinguishable from i  0

large and the transition from bound to unbound appears
rather smooth For larger systems the transition becomes
sharper and discontinuous This discontinuity is demon-
strated by the average number of closed bonds in the adhe-
sion cluster which shows a steep decrease as the occupancy
switches from bound to unbound For a bimodal distribu-
tion with two distinct macrostates average numbers of
closed bonds can be dened in the two peaks separately
We use the probability functions piNt
i3 for the upper
and pi1
i0 for the lower peak with proper normal-
ization to calculate the average number of closed bonds
in the two macrostates Fig 7 shows that these averages
vary slightly with  and the steep decrease of the full aver-
age is mostly due to the change in occupancy probability
than in the position of the peaks Fig 7 also shows the
bifurcation result from the mean eld equation For the
larger system Nt  25 the position of the maxima are
in good agreement with the xed points and the onset of
bistability at small  agrees well with the rst bifurcation
For the smaller system Nt  10 the agreement between
xed points and maxima is still good but the onset of bi-
modality is overestimated by the lower bifurcation Here
the stochastic potential yields a much better estimate for
the locations of the bifurcation not shown For growing
cluster size the range of parameters in which the coexist-
ing macrostates are occupied to a similar degree shrinks
although the range of bistability as revealed by the de-
terministic equation or the stochastic potential grows In
analogy to rst order phase transitions the discontinuous
transition from bound to unbound will occur at a sharp
parameter value in the limit of innite clusters
Biological systems are usually of nite size and time
dependent processes are often important Whether coex-
isting states and transitions between them can be observed
depends on the relative occupancy of the coexisting states
and on the time scale for transitions between the states
The bare presence of bistability identied in the determin-
istic equation is irrelevant if the time scale for the tran-
sitions is larger than the typical observation times The
time scale for transitions will also be important if param-
eters are time dependent If the change of parameters is
faster than the time scale for equilibration of the probabil-

the following section we therefore analyze dynamic prop-
erties of the master equation
6 Dynamic properties of the master equation
The stationary probability distribution Eq 28 arises by
averaging over many individual trajectories or over a sin-
gle trajectory for a long time Fig 8 shows two sample
trajectories for Nt  10 bonds and   05 at   1 and
  3 respectively The stochastic trajectories are gener-
ated with the Gillespie algorithm for exact stochastic sim-
ulations 3637 and show how the number of closed bonds
i changes over time For   1 the stationary distribu-
tion is unimodal and has a single peak around the bound
state Due to the small cluster size the number of closed
bonds uctuates strongly around the average occasionally
it reaches the completely dissociated state but rebinding
takes place immediately This leads to a single broad peak
as in Fig 7 at small  For   3 the stationary distribu-
tion is bimodal The sample trajectory alternates between
bound and unbound state As long as the time spent in the
respective states is large enough the time taken for the
actual transition is negligible When bound the trajectory
uctuates around an average as in a An encounter of the
completely dissociated state however is usually followed
by a longer time with no or few bonds Single closed bonds
are formed occasionally but this rarely leads to the for-
mation of a large number of closed bonds Increasing the
receptor-ligand distance further increases the time spent
in the unbound state relative to that in the bound state
This means that the occupancy probability of the bound
state is reduced The trajectories alternating between the
states with very short transition times yield the bimodal
stationary distribution The probability to nd the system
in one of the states is proportional to the time spent in
that state before a transition For very large  with uni-
modal distribution binding of trajectories does not take
place with appreciable frequency
The dynamic properties of the stochastic model can
be characterized by the mean rst passage time Tmn be-
tween two states m and n that is the time it takes on
average to reach n for the rst time from m To elucidate
the relevance of the xed points in the stochastic system
the transition times from the unbound state m  0 to the
bound state n  Nt2 and vice versa are of particular in-
terest The value Nt2 can be used because in this context
it is only relevant that the bound state is above the tran-
sition barrier between the two macrostates the dynamics
within the respective bassins of attraction are much faster
than the dynamics across the barrier For a one-step mas-
ter equation like Eq 1 the mean rst passage time from
the initial state m to the nal state n satises the recur-
sion relation 24

and from the bound state to the unbound unbinding
time For parameter values for which only a single sta-
ble macrostate exists the transition time into this state
is very small and on the order of magnitude of transi-
tions between neighboring states The time for transitions
in the reverse direction becomes extremely large for large
clusters The range of bistability is characterized by bind-
ing and unbinding times which are both larger than the
single step transition times Because barrier crossing itself
is a fast process the ratio of binding to unbinding time
equals the ratio of occupancy of the two macrostates in
the range of bistability The point where the transition
times are equal thus denes a stochastic transition point
at which both states are equally occupied The plots of the
transition times as function of  for dierent  at Nt  10
Thorsten Erdmann Ulrich S Schwarz Impact of receptor-ligand distance on adhesion cluster stability
in Fig 9a show that this transition point shifts to larger
 with decreasing  because with increasing temperature
ligand mobility larger separations can be bridged by
the ligand tethers Fig 9b plots the transition times for
  1 at dierent Nt This shows that the stochastic tran-
sition point shifts to larger separation values with growing
cluster size At the same time the corresponding switch-
ing times grow super-exponentially fast This implies that
for a given separation and growing cluster size the bound
macrostate will eectively become the only stable state
frequent switching between bound and unbound states can
thus only occur for small clusters It is important to note
that these important conclusions can only be drawn by
considering the full stochastic dynamics
Stochasticity of binding and strong dependence of the
mean rst passage time on  has to be considered in mea-
surements of the binding ranges of tethered ligands If the
receptor-ligand distance is reduced step by step and the
transducer is held at a constant distance during a short
period of time s binding will typically be observed at a
distance where the mean rst passage time from unbound
to bound T  is comparable to s In general binding
is always possible for all distances smaller than the con-
tour length of the tethers The actual binding distance is
a stochastic variable If transitions proceed with the con-
stant rate 1T  the probability to observe binding after
the nth step at a distance n is
p  1  exp sT n
exp sT i 
With the strong dependence of the binding time on  as
shown in Fig 9 this distribution will be have a sharp peak
when T n  s  T in The probability to bind
at any distance below a given n is then close to a step
function as observed experimentally and theoretically 15
7 Extension to worm-like chain model
Unlike in the simple harmonic spring model real polymers
are not innitely extensible but are characterized by a
nite contour length A commonly used model for real
polymers is the so-called worm-like chain or Kratky-Porod
model 33 It has been used before to model semi-exible
biopolymers like DNA F-actin or titin 38 A worm-like
chain is characterized by the contour length L and the
persistence length Lp which describes the bending stiness
of the lament The worm-like chain model can also be
extended to include elasticity of the polymer backbone
which allows stretching beyond the contour length 39
The forces needed to stretch the polymer monomers are
much larger than the typical thermal forces and will not
be considered in the following
be approximated by the interpolation formula 38

tees that the force vanishes at vanishing extension We

sions the distribution resembled that of a freely jointed
chain 33 The exact form of the distribution should have
no inuence on the generic aspects we are interested in

normalization but is irrelevant for binding

harmonic model In the following we use p  1   1
wlc  15 and wlc  01 The choices for wlc and wlc
mean that the properties of the tethers at small extension
are similar as above for the harmonic tethers
73 Analysis of the worm-like chain
A steady state analysis of the mean eld equation Eq 2
with the transition rates Eq 37 and Eq 42 from the
worm-like chain model shows that the bifurcation behaviour
is very similar to the one obtained for the linear springs
except that distances larger than wlc  1 are not possible
due to the nite contour length Fig 10 shows a density
plot of the stationary probability distribution Eq 28 for
the worm-like chain transition rates Eq 37 and Eq 42
as function of wlc Together with the distribution the de-
pendence of the upper stable xed point of the mean eld
equation and the average number of closed bonds of the
full distribution as well as that of the bound and unbound
macro-states are displayed Again the binding region is
bounded by the maximum extension wlc  L  1
As for the harmonic tethers a bimodal region is found in
which two macrostates coexist The average number of
closed bonds in the bound state and the position of the
maximum agree well with the upper stable xed point
of the deterministic equation Both depend hardly on the
receptor-ligand distance wlc The average number of closed
bonds jumps from bound to unbound state in a discontinu-
ous transition This transition becomes sharper for larger
clusters that is the width of the region in which both
states are occupied to an appreciable degree decreases
with increasing cluster size
The physical reason for the striking plateau in the
bound state is the non-linearity of the worm-like chain
force extension relation which reects the strain-stiening
typical for biopolymers A binding tether thus pulls the
relatively soft transducer until the stinesses match that
is to the regime of harmonic tethers with wlc  15
Therefore the nal extension of the bound tethers de-
creases less than linear with wlc and the eect on the
number of closed bonds is weaker than for the harmonic
model If the transducer was replaced by another worm-
like chain the behavior of the system should be more like
the harmonic model
8 Conclusion
In this paper we have introduced a stochastic model which
allows to study the interplay of cooperative binding and
unbinding for nite-sized adhesion clusters mediated by
tethered ligands Our model is based on established prin-
ciples of receptor-ligand binding including Kramers-type
rupture rates and separation-dependent binding rates based
on the notion of an encounter complex By implement-
ing these principles in the framework of a one-step mas-
ter equation we were able to apply many powerful tech-
niques from stochastic dynamics including a Kramers-
Moyal derivation of a Fokker-Planck equation which in
turn corresponds to a stochastic potential and exact solu-
tions for stationary solutions and mean rst passage times
In particular a bifurcation analysis based on the stochas-
tic potential could be compared to the bifurcation analysis
of the mean eld equation to the master equation
Our model shows that the simple mechanical model of
Fig 1 can lead to a bistable situation in which two dier-
ent states of adhesion bound and unbound coexist The
underlying reason for the occurence of bistability is the
existence of two mechanisms for positive feedback one for
rupture and one for binding Cooperative bonds share the
force exerted by the transducer so that the force exerted
on each closed bond reduces upon binding At the same
time the extension of the tethers reduces upon binding
which then increases the probability for further binding
In consequence the transition rates in the master equa-
tion are both strongly non-linear functions of the number
of closed bonds which both can lead to positive feedback
This leads to an instability for the intermediate numbers of
closed bonds and thus to bistability The model discussed
in this paper is an extension to a previously introduced
model in which only the rupture rate was a non-linear
function of the number of closed bonds 1121 It could
be re-obtained from the current model in the limit of a

In the mean eld description bistability leads to hys-
teresis for the binding and unbinding range binding from
the unbound state takes place at a smaller distance than
unbinding from the bound state Unlike for previous dis-
cussions for non-cooperative bonds 1617 this is not due
to kinetic eects In the stochastic description the bistable
system is characterized by a bimodal stationary probabil-
ity distribution Fluctuations over the barrier separating
the stable states allow equilibration of the distribution
The time scale for equilibration has been calculated as
the mean rst passage time between the dierent adhe-
sion states Due to these nite transition times kinetic
eects from changes of external parameters are important
for the behavior of the system In analogy to thermody-
namic systems at rst order phase transitions changes
of parameters on time scales smaller than the transition
times allow occupation of the metastable states while for
slower changes a stationary distribution will occur In the
bimodal region the system frequently alternates between
bound and unbound state For large systems the transi-
tion times become very large and the transition between
bound and unbound becomes very sharp The bimodal re-
gion in which two states are occupied to an appreciable
and comparable amount becomes very small
The predictions of this paper for the internal dynam-
ics of adhesion clusters can be investigated with exper-
imental setups like AFM or the surface force apparatus
which allow to study the specic binding of two opposing
surfaces with controled separation However to map out
the occupancy distribution for bound and unbound states
could be tedious because of large transition times and low
occupancy outside the dominant state If measuring the
binding range by stepwise reduction of the receptor-ligand
distance binding will take place when the transition time
is smaller or equal to the waiting time For large systems
this will lead to hysteresis as in the deterministic case For
smaller systems hysteresis will decrease due to the smaller
transition times In experiments with the surface forces
apparatus 1415 a behavior similar to the one predicted
here has been observed After initial binding a large at-
tractive force was measured until an equilibrium position
of the surfaces was established In our model this increase
would be due to the increased extension of the transducer
spring In those experiments irreversible bonds with very
large anity have been used so that repeated transitions
between bound and unbound states could not be observed
In order to test our results it would be necessary to
use reversible adhesion bonds with low anity In general
binding through reversible bonds is highly relevant for bi-
ological systems In particular cell-matrix adhesion is me-
diated by reversible bonds like the ones between integrin-
receptors in the plasma membrane and bronectin in the
extracellular environment In this case the equilibrium
length of the ligand tether is b  11 nm Using the pa-
rameter values given in Tab I one then nds from the
stochastic model for Nt  5 that for small adhesion clus-
ters bistability should occur around a relaxed receptor-
ligand distance of 8 nm   075 23 Together with
the ligand and receptor rest lengths this results in a cell
substrate distance of around 20 nm that is the physio-
logical value for cell-matrix adhesion 13 Therefore the
mechanism of bistability as described here can be used by
cells to explore the extracellular space by many small and
transient adhesions On encountering favorable conditions
these small adhesions might mature eg by recruitment
of additional receptors The results presented here show
that this quickly leads to switching times which keep the
adhesions in the bound macrostate
In order to present a simple and reasonable model
here we have made the crucial assumption that all bonds
Thorsten Erdmann Ulrich S Schwarz Impact of receptor-ligand distance on adhesion cluster stability
are equivalent This assumption leads to a one-step master
equation and allows the application of many powerful tools
from stochastic dynamics In the future our model could
be extended to include additional aspects of biomimetic
or biological systems which usually however can not be
described in the framework of a one-step master equa-
tion In order to describe the growth and shrinkage of
adhesion clusters the overall number of bonds Nt should
be made dynamic possible involving regulation through
the cytoskeleton Assuming an elastic rather than a rigid
transducer requires solution of elastic equations in order
to derive the exact details of the force distribution The
force distribution would also be changed when accounting
for possible curvature of the opposing surfaces Finally it
would also be interesting to consider the eect of disor-
der eg in bond resting lengths or single bond on- and
o-rates
