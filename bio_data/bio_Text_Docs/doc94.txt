ABSTRACT 
Secrete-and-sense  cells  can  communicate  by  secreting  a  signaling  molecule  while  also 
producing  a  receptor  that  detects  the  molecule    The  cell  can  potentially  talk  to  itself  self-
communication  or 
to  neighboring  cells  with 
the  same 
receptor 
neighbor-
communication  The  predominant  forms  of  secrete-and-sense  cells  are  self-communicating 
autocrine  cells  that  are  largely  found  in  animals  and  neighbor-communicating  quorum 
sensing cells that are mostly associated with bacteria While assumed to function independent 
of one another recent studies have discovered quorum sensing organs and autocrine signaling 
microbes  Moreover  similar  types  of  genetic  circuits  control  many  autocrine  and  quorum 
sensing cells We outline these recent findings and explain how autocrine and quorum sensing 
are two sides of a many-sided dice created by the versatile secrete-and-sense cell  
Secreting signaling molecules A fundamental mode of communication 
Cells  can  communicate  with  each  other  by  secreting  signaling  molecules  that  diffuse 
between  them  Cells  use  a  variety  of  receptors  to  detect  the  type  and  concentration  of  each 
extracellular signaling molecule When the receptors bind to their cognate signaling molecules 
they trigger cascades of intracellular signaling events that regulate diverse processes such as 
the growth and death of cells 1-3 differentiation 4-8 and gene expression 9-20 We usually 
categorize cells that secrete signaling molecules into two types those that engage in autocrine 
signaling and those that engage in paracrine signaling Figure 1 In autocrine signaling a cell 
secretes a signaling molecule and simultaneously makes a receptor for that molecule Paracrine 
signaling  involves  two  types  of  cells  One  type  of  cell  secretes  a  molecule  without  making  a 
receptor for it and the other type of cell makes a receptor for the molecule without secreting the 
molecule Along with contact-mediated signaling called juxtacrine signaling 21 autocrine and 
paracrine signaling are responsible for almost all known cell-cell communications in multicellular 
systems  22  These  modes  of  signaling  have  primarily  been  studied  in  mammalian  systems 
But recently much progress has been made on studying paracrine signaling in populations of 
microbial cells such as bacterial biofilms and then extracting quantitative principles that apply to 
both  mammalian  systems  eg  tissues  and  microbial  systems  eg  biofilms  23  However 
many studies of autocrine signaling still mainly focus on mammalian systems and they typically 
exclude  discussions  on  microbial  cells  notably  on  how  autocrine  signaling  may  be  related  to 
quorum sensing Quorum sensing which allows the cells to measure their population density 
in  order  to  make  collective  decisions  is  one  of  the  most  well-known  and  ubiquitous  forms  of 
microbial communication  
While  autocrine  signaling  and  quorum  sensing  both  involve  cells  that  secrete  a  signaling 
molecule and express its cognate receptors they have long been thought to be two disparate 
forms  of  signaling  likely  because  the  two  have  seemingly  different  functions  and  purposes 
Autocrine  signaling  has  been  historically  understood  albeit  only  recently  demonstrated  in  live 
cells 24 to enable a single cell to talk to itself 25 whereas quorum sensing is designed for 
multiple cells to talk to each other but not for each cell to talk to itself 26 In this sense quorum 
sensing is similar to paracrine signaling in terms of its function because paracrine signaling is 
designed for a cell to talk to other cells but not to itself On the other hand quorum sensing is 
more similar to autocrine signaling than paracrine signaling in terms of its molecular parts ie 
the same cell produces the receptor and the signaling molecule Given these observations it is 
natural to ask how autocrine signaling and quorum sensing might be related to each other both 
functionally and through evolution Recently researchers have begun to concretely connect the 
two  in  terms  of  their  common  functions  and  features  of  the  genetic  circuits  that  control  them 
24  Indeed  quorum  sensing  in  mammalian  organs  27  and  autocrine  signaling  in  microbes 
have  been  discovered  24  while  additional  work  has  shown  that  autocrine  signaling  and 
quorum sensing are two ends of a continuous spectrum of signaling modes that is spanned by a 
generic secrete-and-sense cell - a cell that secretes a signaling molecule and simultaneously 
makes  its  cognate  receptor  but  can  talk  to  itself  like  autocrine  signaling  and  talk  to  its 
neighbors  like  quorum  sensing  and  paracrine  signaling  24  28  These  recent  findings  are 
causing  a  dismantling  of  the  historically  established  barrier  between  researchers  who  have 
mainly studied quorum sensing in microbes eg bacteria yeasts and researchers who have 
investigated autocrine signaling in metazoan cells eg tumors T-cells embryos 24 Below 
we  review  how  researchers  have  traditionally  thought  about  autocrine  signaling  and  quorum 
sensing and describe recent studies that connect the two 
Autocrine signaling A cell that talks to itself 
One  of  the  first  descriptions  of  autocrine  signaling  arose  when  researchers  proposed 
how tumor cells could originate in epithelial tissues in the 1980s 25 It was known that many 
types of cells in healthy tissues secreted signaling molecules called Epidermal Growth Factors 
EGFs to regulate their proliferation Figure 2A It was hypothesized and later confirmed that 
when  this  autocrine  signaling  which  causes  each  healthy  cell  to  stimulate  its  own  growth  by 
sensing its own growth factor molecule is mis-regulated and thus over stimulates the cells cells 
can  grow  uncontrollably  and  initiate  tumors  Since  then  researchers  have  found  many 
examples  of  autocrine  signaling  in  various  mammalian  cells  2  29-34  Figure  2B-D    In  the 
human  immune  system  the  naive  T-helper  cells  use  the  molecules  Interleukin  IL-4  and 
interferon-  for  autocrine  signaling  in  order  to  differentiate  into  one  of  two  cell  states  Th1  or 
Th2  cells  35  36    The  CD4  T-cells  use  autocrine  signaling  through  IL-2  to  control  their 
proliferation  and  apoptosis  2  Figure  2B  In  early  mammalian  embryos  including  human 
embryos a decreased level of autocrine signaling through the Platelet Activating Factor PAF 
ligand  decreases  the  embryos  chances  of  survival  Figure  2C  31-33  Faulty  regulations  of 
autocrine signaling turn healthy cells into cancer cells and initiate the growth of tumors 29 For 
example  renegade  autocrine  signaling  through  IL-6  can  trigger  lung  adenocarcinoma  in  mice 
and  humans  The  somatic  mutations  in  epidermal  growth  factor  receptor  EGFR  in  initially 
healthy mammary and lung cells cause the cells to secrete IL-6 at an abnormally high rate The 
IL-6  then  bind  to  the  EGFRs  on  these  cells  which  then  leads  to  highly  activated  STAT3 
signaling in them This in turn causes the cells to divide at an abnormally high rate which leads 
to tumors 29 Figure 2D  
Based  on  these  examples  the  prevailing  belief  has  been  that  the  primary  purpose  of 
autocrine signaling is for a cell to use its receptors to capture the signaling molecule that it had 
secreted so that it can talk to itself which we call self-communication instead of sending the 
molecule  to  its  neighboring  cells  to  communicate  with  them  which  we  call  neighbor-
communication  The  reasoning  behind  this  is  that  for  autocrine  signaling  cells  typically 
express  a  high  abundance  of  receptors  that  have  a  high  binding  affinity  for  the  signaling 
molecule 37 Thus such a cell would have a high probability of capturing the molecules that it 
had just secreted Since the molecule returns to the cell after being secreted the cell would not 
be  able  to  communicate  with  its  neighboring  cells  According  to  this  scenario  autocrine 
signaling would require only a single cell and such a cell would be able to rapidly respond to its 
own signaling molecule 38-40 Moreover this scenario could provide a plausible reason for why 
autocrine signaling is ubiquitous in controlling proliferation of cells through growth factors and in 
embryogenesis  In  both  embryogenesis  and  signaling  through  growth  factors  cells  have  to 
rapidly  undergo  changes  in  their  growth  gene  expression  and  differentiation  A  cell  that  can 
quickly  capture  its  own  signaling  molecule  would  be  able  to  more  rapidly  respond  to  the 
molecule than a cell that relied on a molecule from other cells ie a receiver cell in paracrine 
signaling  because  the  molecule  would  need  a  shorter  distance  to  travel  than  in  paracrine 
signaling However this idea of pure self-communication has persistently posed two questions 
that are only now being resolved i why would a cell go through the many steps of producing 
and secreting a molecule if it only wanted to communicate with itself ii Why does the cell not 
rely entirely on intracellular signals The other challenge has been that for many years it was 
difficult to experimentally show that autocrine signaling involved self-communication in individual 
cells  It  was  not  until  recently  that  researchers  performed  measurements  of  gene  expression 
with  single  cell  resolution  to  definitively  prove  that  autocrine  signaling  enables  pure  self-
communication  without  any  neighbor-communication  24  These  measurements  and  nascent 
theoretical studies 41-43 are now beginning to resolve the aforementioned two questions We 
will elaborate these resolutions after first reviewing some basics of quorum sensing 
Quorum sensing A cell that talks to other cells 
Quorum sensing is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a signaling molecule in 
order to communicate with other cells ie engaging in a pure neighbor-communication in a 
way that depends on the density of the cell population It has been the main paradigm for 
understanding multicellular behaviors and communication among bacteria and microbial 
eukaryotes 26 Quorum sensing triggers coordinated and collective actions such as all cells in 
the population turning on the same gene once the cell population density is above a certain 
threshold value In this way one can consider quorum sensing to be paracrine signaling that is 
activated by cells when the density of the cell population is above a certain threshold whereas 
the cells do not communicate with self or neighbors when the population density is below the 
threshold Quorum sensing is usually used when the benefits of cooperative actions outweigh 
the benefits of each cell acting autonomously 26 
Microbial  cells  rather  than  being  just  autonomous  individuals  use  quorum  sensing  to 
accomplish tasks as a collective entity For example the marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri reside 
inside  the  light  organ  of  the  Hawaiian  Bobtail  Squid  Euprymna  scolopes  and  uses  quorum 
sensing through the secreted molecule AHL Acyl Homoserine Lactone to produce light inside 
the  squid  a  phenomenon  called  bioluminescence  Figure  3A  44-47  When  the  population 
density of the Vibrio fischeri cells is low the concentration of the secreted AHLs remains low As 
the  population  density  increases  so  does  the  concentration  of  AHL  At  a  certain  population 
density the concentration of AHL goes above a genetically encoded threshold which then turns 
on  downstream  genes  that  lead  to  bioluminescence  26  Researchers  have  also  engineered 
genetic circuits in Escherichia coli cells so that the cells can quorum sense through AHL which 
has provided investigation into population-level behaviors such as population density control of 
E colis rate of death 48 49  
Over  the  last  decade  numerous  studies  have  combined  mathematical  modeling  with 
fluorescence based methods such as time-lapse microscopy for measuring gene expression in 
single cells to reveal how individual cells encode the threshold for quorum sensing and the kinds 
of genetic circuits that can achieve quorum sensing 50-53  In the soil amoeba Dictyostelium 
discoideum  a  special  form  of  quorum  sensing  called  dynamic  quorum  sensing  causes  the 
cells to transition from unicellular individuals to macroscopic aggregates called fruiting bodies 
Figure  3B  54-57  For  example  amoeba  cells  continuously  secrete  Pre-Starvation  Factor 
PSF The concentration of PSF increases as the density of starving cells increases 57 When 
the  PSF  concentration  reaches  a  certain  threshold  the  cells  respond  by  turning  on  the 
expression  of  a  set  of  genes  that  eventually  trigger  secretion  of  the  chemo-attractant  cyclic 
Adenosine Mono-Phosphate cAMP cAMP secretion is dynamically regulated by the density of 
the amoeba with a positive feedback that regulates the secretion of cAMP ie cells increase 
their  average  secretion  rate  of  cAMP  as  they  sense  more  cAMP  This  regulation  eventually 
leads  to  the  aggregation  of  cells  into  fruiting  bodies  7  57  58  This  example  suggests  that 
quorum sensing may have been crucial in the evolution of multicellularity 
Quorum  sensing  is  also  seen  in  cooperative  and  commensal  relationships  among 
different species 59-63 Moreover researchers are currently investigating inhibitors that disrupt 
quorum sensing in bacteria ie quorum quenching as an alternative to antibiotics to which 
many bacteria have developed resistance 60-65 to treat cancer 60 66 and to treat wounds 
67  
Based on these examples quorum sensing can be considered a form of paracrine 
signaling that depends on the density of the cell population despite that quorum sensing cells 
produce both a signaling molecule and its receptor which is more similar to autocrine cells 
Typically receptors for the signaling molecule used in quorum sensing have a low binding 
affinity for the molecule 26 Moreover these receptors tend to be expressed in low abundance 
Thus microbes that quorum sense would only be able to detect the presence of the signaling 
molecule when there is a sufficiently high density of it which would occur only when the cell 
population density is sufficiently high 26 
A secrete-and-sense cell uses one molecule to talk to itself and to other cells  
One of the main goals of systems biology is to connect seemingly disparate biological 
systems under common quantitative principles Recent studies of quorum sensing and autocrine 
signaling are pointing towards such unification  between the two modes For one researchers 
are now discovering quorum sensing in metazoan cells and in animal populations Figure 3C-
D For example researchers have recently found that hair follicles underneath the mouse skin 
regenerate damaged hairs only if the density of damaged hairs is above a certain threshold ie 
number of plucked hairs per unit area of skin Figure 3C 27 This constitutes an example of 
quorum sensing at the level of a whole organ hair follicle Researchers have also found that 
the ants Temnthorax albipennis use quorum sensing to migrate to their nest Namely each ant 
counts  the  rate  at  which  it  encounters  other  ants  as  the  ants  roam  about  in  search  of  a  new 
nest  Once  each  ants  rate  of  encounter  goes  above  a  certain  threshold  the  ants  collectively 
migrate to the region where each of them and thus everyone experiences an encounter rate 
that  is  above  the  threshold  This  rate  informs  their  new  nesting  site  Figure  3D  68  Similar 
group decisions have been observed in honeybees migrating to their nests 69 
Adding towards the trend of unification has been the recent demonstration of autocrine 
signaling  in  microbial  cells  24  A  recent  study  has  demonstrated  autocrine  signaling  in 
engineered  budding  yeasts  and  in  the  process  proposed  a  fundamental  connection  between 
autocrine signaling and quorum sensing 24 The study engineered a simple genetic circuit in 
budding yeast cells that caused the cells to secrete a mating pheromone -factor and express 
a receptor Ste2 for that pheromone 70 The different concentrations of the mating pheromone 
caused the cells to express different amounts of a fluorescent protein but not mate with each 
other Four parts of the secrete-and-sense genetic circuit could also be tuned independently 
of  each  other  over  a  wide  range  and  demonstrated  various  social  behaviors  that  the 
engineered yeast cells could achieve Figure 4  These factors were i The expression level of 
the receptor ii Secretion rate of the -factor iii The expression level of a protease that actively 
degraded the -factor outside the cell and iv The strength of a positive feedback that caused 
the  cells  to  increase  the  secretion  rate  of  the  -factor  as  the  sensed  concentration  of  the  -
factor  increased  Through  this  tuning  the  study  showed  that  autocrine  signaling  and  quorum 
sensing  are  merely  two  extreme  ends  of  a  continuous  spectrum  of  a  signaling  modality  and 
proposed  that  a  more  generic  secrete-and-sense  cell  could  span  this  sociability  spectrum 
Figure  4  Namely  autocrine  signaling  is  the  asocial  end  of  the  sociability  spectrum  while 
quorum sensing is the social end of the sociability spectrum Figure 4 The generic secrete-
and-sense  cell  which  is  any  cell  mammalian  or  bacterial  whose  genetic  circuit  contains  the 
four parts mentioned above would span the rest of this spectrum by tuning these four parts of 
the secrete-and-sense circuit 24  
In  other  recent  studies  28  42  researchers  have  developed  mathematical  models  to 
reveal  how  the  parameters  of  secrete-and-sense  circuits  could  be  tuned  to  allow  the  cells  to 
communicate with each other thus achieving efficient neighbor-communication that is the basis 
of  quorum  sensing  In  a  recent  study  42  researchers  developed  a  mathematical  model  to 
analyze the secrete-and-sense circuit in the T-cells of our immune system Their model showed 
that a group of secrete-and-sense T-cells can compete for the same global pool of the secreted 
IL-2 Their model predicted this by tuning the activation threshold which is the concentration 
of the IL-2 at which the cells can switch on their genes that affect their proliferation rate Thus 
the  researchers  showed  that  in  a  population  of  polyclonal  T-cells  with  distinct  activation 
thresholds the cells could either compete or cooperate with each other Recent experiments 2 
24  have  confirmed  key  predictions  of  this  model  and  affirmed  that  secrete-and-sense  cells 
could achieve density dependent paracrine signaling ie quorum sensing 
These and other recent studies use experiments 2 24 and mathematical models 28 
42 to show that the secrete-and-sense circuit motif Figure 4 allows cells to realize autocrine 
signaling and density-dependent paracrine signaling ie quorum sensing at different times to 
achieve  distinct  goals  They  demonstrate  that  there  is  no  rigid  boundary  between  quorum 
sensing and autocrine signaling This division is an historical artifact of researchers in different 
disciplines having studied quorum sensing and autocrine signaling as separate phenomena By 
considering both quorum sensing and autocrine signaling at the same time recent studies have 
shown that there is a continuous spectrum between the two modes of signaling 2 24 28 42 A 
mammalian or microbial cell can use autocrine signaling and quorum sensing simultaneously 
Cells can tune their degree of autocrine signaling and their degree of quorum sensing by tuning 
each  of  the  four  elements  of  its  genetic  circuit  to  regulate  respectively  the  amount  of  self-
communication  and  neighbor-communication  Figure  4  The  cell  can  continuously  tune  these 
two  degrees  of  communication  to  realize  a  spectrum  of  signaling  modes  ie  a  self-
communication  and  neighbor-communication  A  fundamental  trade-off  in  this  spectrum 
however  is  that  a  high  degree  of  neighbor-communication  comes  at  the  cost  of  lowering  the 
degree of self-communication and vice versa 24 
Concluding Remarks 
We  have  outlined  nascent  studies  that  demonstrated  autocrine  signaling  to  be  more 
closely  related  to  quorum  sensing  than  was  previously  thought  We  can  consider  quorum 
sensing to arise from the ability of cells that are conventionally called autocrine cells to engage 
in  pure  neighbor-communication  Figure  4  as  in  paracrine  signaling  Conversely  cells  that 
quorum sense can engage in self-signaling as in autocrine signaling by tuning their secretion 
and sensing of the signaling molecule Importantly both autocrine signaling cells and quorum 
sensing  cells  can  tune  their  genetic  circuits  to  realize  a  mixture  of  self-communication  and 
neighbor-communication  Figure  4  This  unified  view  of  autocrine  signaling  and  quorum 
sensing  shows  the  deficiency  of  the  term  autocrine  signaling  as  it  is  conventionally  used  in 
literature  and  textbooks  71  72  which  refers  to  cells  that  secrete  a  signaling  molecule  and 
express  its  cognate  receptor  but  does  not  distinguish  between  whether  such  a  cell 
communicates  with  itself  andor  with  its  neighbors  Cells  that  have  been  traditionally  called 
autocrine cell can engage in paracrine signaling including its density dependent form that we 
call quorum sensing 24 28  But in light of the recent findings outlined in this review we should 
focus  on  which  cell  communicates  with  which  other  cell  when  referring  to  metazoan  and 
bacterial autocrine cells
Despite 
these  recent  progresses  many 
important  questions  still  remain  see 
Outstanding  Questions  An  outstanding  question  is  the  evolutionary  origin  of  autocrine 
signaling One possible answer is that quorum sensing first originated in bacteria and then the 
early  forms  of  multicellular  organisms  ie  animals  inherited  the  secrete-and-sense  circuit  of 
the bacteria that was tuned for quorum sensing The animals could have then tuned each of the 
four  main  elements  of  the  secrete-and-sense  circuit  eg  through  mutations  in  the  regulatory 
regions to achieve pure autocrine signaling or a mixture of self- and neighbor-communication 
Future  work  that  investigates  this  possibility  will  likely  yield  a  more  comprehensive  view  of 
secrete-and-sense cells 
It is also interesting to investigate the possibility that microbial and metazoan cells might 
tune  their  levels  of  autocrine  signaling  and  quorum  sensing  at  different  times  to  suit  different 
needs For example at the beginning of the development of an embryo or a tissue autocrine 
signaling may be used in order to achieve a great biomass and population density within a short 
time  period  and  then  switch  to  quorum  sensing  to  enable  the  cells  within  the  embryo  or  the 
tissue to coordinate their behaviors The different time scales involved in the effects of autocrine 
signaling and quorum sensing may be worth investigating in the future 
Finally many mammalian tissues for example the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas 
consist of defined spatial arrangements of distinct cell types that engage in both autocrine and 
paracrine  signaling  eg  the  beta-cells  of  pancreas  use  insulin  for  autocrine  signaling  73 
Therefore  an  interesting  question  is  how  the  physical  structures  of  various  tissues  affect  the 
degree of autocrine and potentially of quorum sensing in the tissues  
We envision that the above types of studies will reveal deep quantitative principles that 
govern secrete-and-sense cells and cellular communication in general

Figure captions 
Figure  1  Autocrine  and  paracrine  signaling  as  two  fundamental  means  of  cellular 
communication  Cells  often  communicate  by  secreting  a  signaling  molecule  Autocrine 
signaling  and  paracrine  signaling  are  the  two  fundamental  and  ubiquitous  modes  of 
communication through a secreted signaling molecule In autocrine signaling a cell secretes a 
signaling  molecule  and  simultaneously  makes  a  receptor  that  captures  the  molecule  In 
paracrine signaling one type of cell secretes a signaling molecule without making its cognate 
receptor while another type of cell makes the cognate receptor without secreting the molecule 
Figure  2  Examples  of  autocrine  signaling  A  Epidermal  growth  factor  EGF  and  its 
receptor EGFR in epithelial cells B The CD4 T cells use autocrine signaling through IL-2 to 
control  their  proliferation  and  apoptosis  C  Autocrine  signaling  for  example  through  the 
Platelet  Activating  Factor  PAF  plays  an  important  role  in  the  development  of  mammalian 
embryos  A  decreased  amount  of  the  PAF  ligand  reduces  the  embryos  chances  of  surviving 
through development D Faulty autocrine signaling through IL-6 causes uncontrolled growth in 
healthy cells and initiates tumor formation in the early stages of breast and lung cancers  
Figure  3  Examples  of  quorum  sensing  A  When  the  population  density  of  the  marine 
bacteria  Vibrio  fischeri  is  small  the  concentration  of  the  secreted  AHL  Acyl  Homoserine 
Lactones  is  low  An  increase  in  the  cell  population  density  causes  the  extracellular 
concentration of AHL to rise When the concentration of AHL goes above a certain threshold 
the  cells  generate  light  through  the  Lux  system  B  The  soil  amoeba  D  discoideum 
continuously  secrete  Pre-starvation  factor  PSF  The  concentration  of  PSF  increases  as  the 
density  of  starving  cells  rises  When  the  PSF  concentration  reaches  a  certain  threshold  the 
amoeba respond by secreting cyclic Adenosine Mono-Phosphate cAMP This eventually leads 
to the cells aggregating into fruiting bodies C Hair follicles regenerate damaged hairs if and 
only  if  the  density  of  damaged  hairs  is  above  a  certain  threshold  D  The  ant  Temnthorax 
albipennis counts the rate at which it encounters other ants as it walks around in search of a 
new nesting site Once the rate at which each ant encounters other ants goes above a certain 
threshold the ants collectively migrate to the region in which the encounter rate is above the 
threshold to establish their new nest 
Figure 4  Autocrine signaling and quorum sensing are two extreme ends of a spectrum 
of signaling modalities that secrete-and-sense cells can realize A secrete-and-sense cell 
can  tune  each  of  the  four  main  elements  of  its  genetic  circuit  to  control  its  degree  of  self-
communication  ie  extent  of  autocrine  signaling  and  its  degree  of  neighbor-communication 
ie  extent  of  quorum  sensing  The  cell  can  continuously  tune  these  two  degrees  of 
communication to realize a spectrum of signaling modes ie a mixture of autocrine signaling 
and  quorum  sensing  A  fundamental  trade-off  is  inherent  in  this  spectrum  A  high  degree  of 
neighbor-communication comes at the cost of lowering the degree of self-communication and 
vice versa
