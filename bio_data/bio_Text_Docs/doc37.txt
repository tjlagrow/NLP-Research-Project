Abstract
The chemotaxis sensory system allows bacteria such as Escherichia coli to swim towards
nutrients and away from repellents The underlying pathway is remarkably sensitive in
detecting chemical gradients over a wide range of ambient concentrations Interactions
among receptors which are predominantly clustered at the cell poles are crucial to this
sensitivity Although it has been suggested that the kinase CheA and the adapter
protein CheW are integral for receptor connectivity the exact coupling mechanism
remains unclear Here we present a statistical-mechanics approach to model the
receptor linkage mechanism itself building on nanodisc and electron cryotomography
experiments Specifically we investigate how the sensing behavior of mixed receptor
clusters is affected by variations in the expression levels of CheA and CheW at a
constant receptor density in the membrane Our model compares favorably with
dose-response curves from in vivo Forster resonance energy transfer FRET
measurements demonstrating that the receptor-methylation level has only minor effects
on receptor cooperativity Importantly our model provides an explanation for the
non-intuitive conclusion that the receptor cooperativity decreases with increasing levels
of CheA a core signaling protein associated with the receptors whereas the receptor
cooperativity increases with increasing levels of CheW a key adapter protein Finally
we propose an evolutionary advantage as explanation for the recently suggested
CheW-only linker structures
Author Summary
Receptor clusters of the bacterial chemotaxis sensory system act as antennae to amplify
tiny changes in concentrations in the chemical environment of the cell ultimately
steering the cell towards nutrients and away from toxins Despite bacterial chemotaxis
being the most widely studied sensory pathway the exact architecture of the receptor
clusters remains speculative with understanding suffering from a number of paradoxical
observations To address these issues with respect to the protein arrangement in the
linkers connecting receptors we present a statistical-mechanics model that combines
insights from electron cryotomography on the linker architecture with results from
fluorescence imaging of signaling in living cells Although the signaling data for different
expression levels of key molecular components in the linkers seems contradictory at first
our model reconciles these predictions with structural and biochemical data Finally we
provide an evolutionary explanation for the observation that some of the incorporated
linkers do not seem to transmit signals from the receptors
Introduction
Escherichia coli cells are able to sense changes in the chemical environment allowing
the bacteria to move towards higher concentrations of attractants and lower
concentrations of repellents The chemotaxis system is remarkable for its high
sensitivity wide dynamic range and precise adaptation while only involving a small
number of molecular components 13 Despite the importance of receptor clustering in
accounting for these signaling properties 47 there are still unresolved issues with the
clusters in particular with respect to the nature of the coupling mechanism between
receptors 8 It has been proposed that receptors assemble into larger arrays via the
connection of the kinase CheA and the adapter protein CheW 9 10 with potentially
complementary effects of membrane-mediated interactions 11 Unexpectedly in vivo
Forster resonance energy transfer FRET shows that increasing the expression level of
CheA of engineered non-adapting receptors decreases the cooperativity among receptors
In contrast expressing more CheW increases the cooperativity albeit in different ranges
of expression levels 12 This raises the question of how these different observations can
be reconciled
In E coli there are four types of methyl-accepting chemoreceptors the
high-abundance Tar and Tsr receptors that sense serine and aspartate respectively and
the low-abundance Trg and Tap receptors 13 14 In addition Aer is a
chemoreceptor-like sensor of redox potential 15 The chemoreceptors form homodimers
which assemble into trimers of dimers TDs 16 17 On a larger scale these TDs
cluster at cell poles 1820 CheW and CheA which interact with the cytoplasmic
domain of the receptors 21 are involved in the stabilization of these clusters 22
which in turn consist of smaller complexes signaling teams 6 23 24 Signal
transduction is triggered by ligand-receptor binding which leads to a conformational
change in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptors 2527 The removal of attractant
or addition of repellent activates autophosphorylation of the kinase CheA which is
associated with the receptors via the adapter protein CheW Fig 1A The phosphoryl
group is then transferred to the response regulator protein CheY which diffuses
through the cytoplasm CheY-P binds to the flagellar motors to induce clockwise
rotation and tumbling of the cell In contrast addition of attractant or removal of
repellent inhibits autophosphorylation of CheA CheY-P dephosphorylation by
phosphatase CheZ leads to counterclockwise rotation and straight swimming 1
To avoid saturation of the sensory system adaptation is implemented via covalent
receptor modification This is achieved through changing the receptor-methylation level
by the activities of the methyltransferase CheR and the methylesterase CheB which
antagonistically add and remove respectively methyl groups at four or five depending
on the receptor specific glutamate residues on each receptor monomer 33 respectively
Methylation by CheR increases the activity of CheA ie its autophosphorylation rate
thus counteracting the effect of attractant binding In contrast CheB activation by
phosphorylation by CheA-P decreases CheA activity 12 Through genetic engineering
the glutamate residues E can be replaced by one to four glutamine residues Q to
mimic increasing receptor-methylation levels in the absence of CheR and CheB 2 The
E coli chemotaxis pathway is exceptionally well characterized and is thus amenable to
modeling at a high quantitative level
To explain the receptor cooperativity which generates the high sensitivity of the
system the mechanism of receptor-receptor coupling has attracted much
interest 8 3437 Electron cryotomography EC images of the TDs in quick-frozen
Figure 1 Schematic of receptor clustering in E coli A Association and
dissociation of adapter protein CheW and kinase CheA2 with the complexes CheW
interacts directly with the receptors but the interaction of CheA with the receptors is
largely mediated by CheW see below B Electron cryotomography images show that
trimers of dimers TDs of chemoreceptors cluster at the cell poles in a hexagonal
manner 2831 C Nanodisc experiments propose that two TDs are connected by a
linker consisting of two CheW monomers and one CheA2 dimer 9 In reality the P5
domain of CheA may also contact the trimer 21 31 32 although this binding may be
an order of magnitude weaker than CheW-trimer binding 9 29 D Top view of an
ensemble of different sizes of receptor complexes in the cytoplasmic membrane Active
receptors are shown in red and inactive receptors are shown in blue Each linker
between active TDs contributes a coupling energy J
cells led to the idea that TDs form densely packed hexagonal honeycomb arrays Fig
1B 28 32 38 These and other in vitro experiments using nanodiscs and nanoscale
plugs to imitate cellular membranes suggest that CheWCheA2CheW is the
structural core unit linking two TDs see Fig 1C for a simplified depiction 9 An
approach to study the cooperative behavior of the specific receptors inside the cells
indirectly is to monitor the signaling activity of CheY-PCheZ pairs via FRET with
the FRET signal being proportional to the overall CheA activity 39 An increase in
the concentration of CheW was observed to enhance the cooperativity of the FRET
response mechanism whereas unexpectedly an increase in CheA concentration led to
the opposite effect 12 It is well known that multimeric protein complexes can be
inhibited by high concentrations of one of their components similar to the prozone
phenomenon in precipitin tests 40 However it is unclear how the FRET results relate
to other experimental observations including the proposed linker and lattice structures
Here we use statistical-mechanics modeling within the framework of the
Monod-Wyman-Changeux MWC model 41 for cooperative receptor complexes to
unify the assumed linker and lattice structures with the seemingly contradictory FRET
results By implementing the linker structure we initially fit our model of receptor
complexes of up to four TDs to FRET data obtained with cells that express only the
Tar receptor in different non-adapting modification states Next we apply our model to
TarTsrTap and Tsronly cells in the non-adapting QEQE modification state which
mimics half-methylated receptors As a result we recover the experimentally observed
decrease in cooperativity of the response to serine with increasing CheA concentration
whereas increasing CheW yields the observed enhanced cooperativity Note other
higher order effects of protein overexpression such as membrane invaginations or
interference of CheA CheW with clustering are not included Our results surmise that
the observed opposing trends in cooperativity are based on a critical combination of the
correct linker architecture and a constant average complex size
Statistical-mechanics model of chemotaxis receptors
At the heart of our approach lies the MWC model 5 6 12 Chemoreceptors are
regarded as two-state systems being either active on or inactive off with
conformation-dependent dissociation constants K on

ensemble of different complexes with varying complex size x ie number of connected
TDs and partially developed linkers as rest groups R Fig 1D All receptors within a
complex are assumed to share the same conformational state because of tight coupling
For simplicity we consider the CheWCheA2CheW linker structure 9 which we

The TD is assumed to be the smallest receptor unit 9 42 and the maximal number of
connected TDs is restricted to four in line with observed Hill coefficients from
FRET 12 23 Including larger complex sizes does not alter the model predictions but
increases the computational complexity significantly see Materials and Methods Each
dimer can maximally bind to one molecule of CheW whereas CheA is assumed to not
interact with receptor dimers directly In order to restrain the combinatorial complexity
partially developed linkers are only considered in a symmetric manner ie all rest
groups are assumed to be identical in a complex Furthermore we attribute an
attractant energy J to each linker within an active complex a treatment in line with
the previously proposed enhanced coupling among active receptor dimers 24 albeit
independent of receptor-modification level

In the past the Hill coefficient nH and complex size N have broadly been treated as
equivalent to quantify the cooperative behavior of receptor complexes and in 23 an
increase in N with receptor-modification level was equated with an increase in receptor
cooperativity However both quantities are not necessarily the same as approximating
Eq 10 by a Hill function with nH  N requires c cid28 K on
classical MWC model the response of differently modified Tar receptors to MeAsp a
non-metabolizable analog of aspartate can also be described with a fixed N for all
modification levels This treatment results in a similar quality of fit when relating the
reduced number of parameters to the new 2 goodness-of-fit value see S1 Fig As our
D 6 We found that in the
model incorporates an ensemble of complexes of varying sizes the finding of a constant
complex size N in the classical MWC model is naturally generalized by a constant
average complex size cid104Ncid105 with respect to ligand concentration and receptor-modification
state The average complex size which we term receptor density  is given by

with x being the number of dimers of a given complex type S The chemical potential 
in Eq 1 is adjusted throughout the simulation to fulfill this condition reflecting
anticipated regulation of the receptor-expression level by the cell Biologically a
constant receptor density can be achieved by random receptor insertion into a growing
membrane at constant rate 35 Since wild-type cells express and insert receptors in the
QEQE modification state 2 we do not expect a modification-dependent insertion rate
Although allowing for a modification-dependent  would increase the quality of fit
because of an increased number of fitting parameters our minimal model with constant
 can describe the data very well
Results
Receptor-modification level may not determine cooperative
behavior of complexes
In order to test our model we firstly applied it to FRET data of Tar-only receptors in
different non-adapting receptor-modification states from Ref 23 ie TarQEQE
TarQEQQ and TarQQQQ The dose-response curves of the chemoreceptors match
closely the statistical-mechanics model with fixed receptor density and hence fixed
average complex size Fig 2A Figure 2B displays the fitted receptor density  next to
the Hill coefficients nH of the experimental curves see Materials and Methods and the
complex size N of the classical MWC model taken from 23 Although the classical
MWC model predicts a rise in complex size with modification level 23 including its
implementation based on a dynamic Ising model 24 this is not true for the Hill
coefficients see also S1 Fig This finding shows that receptor modification is not the
main determinant of receptor cooperativity
In our model the chemical potential  can be regarded as the cost function for the
cell to provide a constant complex size in the membrane By definition the chemical
potential   FN reflects the amount of energy required for adding a particle to a
system with free energy F  Although the value of the parameter  introduced to ensure
constant receptor density  is gained by solving a highly nonlinear equation its
behavior with respect to ligand concentration is very homogeneous and characterized by
two regimes as shown in Fig 2C While this cost is approximately constant for c  cH
with cH being the half-maximum concentration obtained from Hill fits the cost
necessary to maintain a constant density increases rapidly for ligand concentrations
beyond cH In this second regime the curves for all modification levels m are of the
form f c  f0  ln c which is the functional description of an ideal chemical potential
Although the slope in the second regime is the same for all values of m the different
offsets f0 m reflect the modification-dependent energy m Note if we were instead
to keep  constant and not  then bumps would appear in the dose-response curves
as a result of the receptor density increasing with ligand concentration see S2 Fig
In summary our model is capable of quantitatively describing dose-response curves
from in vivo FRET in particular the receptor-receptor cooperativity Although in spirit
similar to other recent statistical-mechanics models most noticeably by Hansen et

Receptor density governs cooperative behavior of complexes
While the receptor density  is assumed to be constant on a short time scale the rate of
receptor expression and insertion into the membrane can be regulated by the cell on a
longer time scale Hence as a further test of our statistical-mechanics model we
investigated how a change in receptor density  affects CheA activity at wild-type
expression levels for CheA and CheW Figure 3A shows modeled dose-response curves
for different  values of 15  0  0 and 05  0 with 0  75 the wild-type receptor
density and otherwise using the same parameter set as in Fig 2 An increase in
receptor density is directly associated with an enhanced signal amplitude because more
CheA molecules are incorporated into the complexes Figure 3B reflects the associated
trend in cooperativity by comparing density  and Hill coefficient nH  In qualitative
agreement with experimental observations 12 and in line with previous modeling 6
larger complex sizes lead to higher sensitivities and hence steeper dose-response curves
given a certain receptor-modification state Since the expression level of receptors and
other chemotaxis proteins is highest under nutrient-poor conditions the resulting
increase in receptor density and cooperativity leads to enhanced sensitivity when it is
most crucial for cell survival 44

Increasing the CheW level increases receptor cooperativity
To gain insight into the role of CheA and CheW in forming receptor complexes we
varied the expression levels A and W to study the effect on receptor activity
According to the experimental observations in 12 we set the CheW concentrations to
07 01 and 001 and the CheA concentrations to 8 03 and 025 times the wild-type
values W 0 and A0 respectively This allowed us to make the comparison with
experimental dose-response curves from FRET of Tsronly cells for varying CheW
and TarTsrTap cells for varying CheA both in the non-adapting QEQE
modification state To keep the overall number of parameters small the data for
changes in A and W was fitted with the same parameter set   K on
and sW respectively allows for comparison with the FRET signal amplitudes
Subsequently a Hill function was fitted to the model curves and the model Hill
parameters were compared with the experimental values Note that our minimal model
does not account for alternative forms of signaling disruption upon over- or
underexpression of CheACheW such as zipper-like invaginations of the cell
membrane 45 or interference with trimer formation 16

change significantly with expression level W at a 95 confidence level which is in
qualitative agreement with the experimental data especially with respect to the highest
CheW expression level the change in nH is less pronounced for the model than the

Increasing the CheA level decreases receptor cooperativity
Changing A in our model has the opposite effect on the Hill coefficient as changing
W This result is in line with experimental data Fig 5ABC The activity amplitude
reflecting the amount of active CheA molecules benefits from higher CheA levels as one
would expect Fig 5D In contrast Hill coefficients are higher for smaller A
recovering the naively unexpected experimental observations Fig 5C Looking at the
distribution of complexes at half-maximum ligand concentration Fig 5E we note that
although high CheA concentrations favor rest groups including CheA complex sizes of 3
and 4 TDs are more likely at lower concentrations of CheA
The opposing trends in nH concerning variations in A and W are a direct result of
the linker stoichiometry and fixed average complex size For complexes with rest groups
the ratio of CheW molecules per TD is independent of the complex size Fig 6A

However for species without rest groups this ratio increases with the number of
coupled TDs As a result an enhancement in W yields larger complexes that directly
incorporate more CheA molecules Furthermore empty sites ensure a constant receptor
density even when expression levels of CheW and CheA are extremely low In this case
the receptor density still remains constant as empty sites can be occupied by individual
TDs This requires a dilute membrane ie a receptor density not much larger than
cid104cid105  3cid104xcid105  9 see Fig 2B
In contrast the corresponding ratio of CheA dimers per TD is highest for single TDs
with full rest groups and decreases with increasing complex size Fig 6B The CheA
molecules within the rest groups contribute to the FRET amplitude but not to the
receptor cooperativity An accompanying rise in the number of occupied membrane sites
ensures a constant receptor density

complexes with rest groups the number of CheW molecules per TD is independent of
complex size For species with no rest groups this ratio increases with the number of
TDs in the species Raising the expression level of CheW results in the formation of
larger complex sizes B The number of CheA dimers per TD shows two opposing
trends with respect to complex size As the ratio is highest for single TDs with
CheA2-including rest groups raising the expression level of CheA results in smaller
complex sizes but an increased number of CheA molecules contributing to the signal
amplitude
Electron cryotomography suggests the existence of CheW-only
linkers
Our model qualitatively reproduces the experimental results obtained when the
expression levels of CheW and CheA were changed However there are quantitative
differences especially with respect to the change in cooperativity as a function of the
expression level of CheW This change is less pronounced in the model than in the
experiment Recent findings from electron cryotomography may shed light on the
reasons for these discrepancies Although both studies stressed the importance of one
dimeric CheA and two CheWs as the minimal unit needed for kinase activation Briegel
et al 30 and Liu et al 31 proposed additional CheW-only linkers underlining the
role of CheW in the cooperative behavior of TDs Such structures could explain how
increased levels of CheW contribute to the cooperativity of TDs In order to quantify
this effect we allowed for additional CheW-only linkers in our model Fig 7 The
dimeric appearance of CheW in the linker is accounted for by a new parameter W2  we
keep the previously introduced rest groups for simplicity
Figure 8 shows the results for varying expression levels of CheW and CheA The
dose-response curves of the new model exhibit the same trends in Hill coefficient and
amplitude for variation in W Fig 8A and A Fig 8B as before in agreement with
experimental results see also S3 Fig However the difference in behavior is
manifested in the comparison panels below The previously obtained minor changes in
receptor cooperativity as a function of W are now much more pronounced Fig 8C
although the modeled Hill coefficients for A variation are larger than the experimental
ones Fig 8D The excess CheW leads to formation of CheW-only linkers and hence
larger complex sizes when the amount of available CheA is held constant
In order to make predictions beyond the data used to fit the model we created
surface plots of amplitudes and Hill coefficients covering several orders of magnitude for
expression levels of CheW and CheA Fig 9 The receptor activity and hence
amplitude increases monotonically with the level of CheA whereas the increase in
amplitude with respect to the level of CheW is only pronounced in a subspace around
the experimental data Fig 9A In the case of high CheA levels CheW-only linkers

Discussion
Receptor coupling plays a key role in the remarkable sensing and signaling properties of
bacterial chemotaxis These networks can explain the high sensitivity wide dynamic
range and precise adaptation In this work we present a statistical-mechanics model of
different complex sizes modeling for the first time a molecular linker architecture
consistent with i FRET dose-response curves ii cryotomography data and iii
nanodisc experiments The linker CheWCheA2CheW proposed by Li and
Hazelbauer 9 is incorporated by assigning expression level-dependent energies W and
A2 respectively for each CheW and CheA2 molecule within a complex as part of a fully
or partially developed linker A coupling energy J  0 attributed to linkers between
active TDs indicates that the coupling between active trimers is stronger than between
inactive trimers in agreement with previous modeling 24 Although the actual
distribution of complex sizes is influenced by expression levels W and A a readily
adapted chemical potential  ensures a fixed average complex size  with respect to
ligand concentration c
Our model was first applied to describe the dose-response of Tar receptors in
different modification states to MeAsp a non-metabolizable analog of aspartate We
mainly considered a constant modification-independent  a constraint that not only
reduces the number of parameters but also calls into question that the complex size
increases with receptor-modification level 23 In our work we discovered the
discrepancies between the number of connected TDs N and the curves Hill coefficients
nH within the classical MWC model An increase in N is not directly associated with
an increase in nH In our statistical-mechanics model the approximately constant nH is

Indeed experiments show that both the level of expression of receptors and the
insertion of newly synthesized receptors into the inner membrane by the Sec-machinery
are highly regulated 47 48
Hansen et al 24 previously presented a dynamic-signaling-team approach to
describe the data obtained with Tar-only cells in which the allosteric coupling among
trimers is represented by a modification-dependent trimer-trimer interaction energy
cid98Jm without modeling the actual protein connectivity Limited conformational spread
and hence a finite complex size is achieved by using a long-range repulsion energy U
between all trimers within a complex In contrast our model is simpler while providing
valuable insights Neither W and A2 nor J in our ensemble model depend on the
modification state of the receptor and  ensures constant average complex size without
introducing a repulsive term Furthermore the chemical potential  c provides
insights into the energetic cost of insertion of receptors into the membrane and its
dependence on ligand concentration c albeit based on an equilibrium mechanism
For constant J and  we conclude that receptor modification mainly governs the
turn off-ligand concentration whereas its influence on receptor clustering is limited
This finding is supported by Briegel et al 49 who found that the receptor array order
and the spacing of receptors in different modification states were indistinguishable This
is in stark contrast to Hansen et al 24 who predict a strong increase in average
complex size with increasing receptor-modification level High-resolution imaging of
equilibrated receptors in artificial membranes by electron or total internal reflection
fluorescence TIRF microscopy may allow direct determination of receptor-complex
distributions and their dependence on receptor-modification level and ligand
concentration Using photoactivated localization microscopy PALM 35 or
quantitative immunoblotting 13 such an investigation could also be performed on
intact cells
Although CheA and CheW have long been known to mediate receptor
interactions 12 22 an increase in the expression level of CheA leads to a reduction in
receptor cooperativity 12 Varying expression levels of CheA and CheW in our model
produced results in agreement with experimental data of Sourjik and Berg 12 thereby
supporting the linker architecture we employed The striking observation that increased
CheA levels lead to higher kinase activities but lower cooperativity is based on the fact
that the number of CheA dimers per TD is highest for single trimers with almost fully
developed linker rest groups Fig 6B Hence overexpression of CheA a bridging
molecule at the center of the linker promotes smaller complex sizes CheA molecules
within the rest groups do not contribute to TD coupling and curve steepness but
nevertheless add to the activity of the FRET signal
In contrast to what is observed with CheA raising the level of CheW leads to larger
complex sizes and an increased number of empty membrane sites Again this behavior
becomes comprehensible when the number of CheW molecules per TD Fig 6A is
taken into account While this ratio is constant for complexes with rest groups it
increases with complex size in the absence of partially developed linkers Larger
complexes directly incorporate more CheA to enhance cooperativity as well as the
amplitudes of FRET signals observed both in the model and experimentally In light of
our model the experimental observations are produced by a combination of constant
receptor density and partial linkers Although partial linkers play a crucial role in the
mechanism of our model their inclusion might appear arbitrary at first Interestingly
Briegel et al 30 recently observed a range of assembly intermediates and partial
receptor hexagons forming when W and A were varied Our surface plots of
amplitudes and Hill coefficients also make testable predictions for wide-ranging CheA
and CheW expression levels Fig 9 Is there any evidence to suggest that  remains
constant when CheA and CheW expression levels change First CheA and CheW
binding to the receptors occurs after insertion of the receptors into the membrane
Second increasing the expression of a protein eg of CheW should remove ribosomes
from translating receptor mRNA 50 51 Although expected to be a minor
perturbation this may lead to a reduced receptor density and hence cooperativity
However the opposite trend is observed in FRET experiments 12
Although our assumed linear linker structure CheWCheA2CheW matches
observed stoichiometries 9 13 electron cryotomography images suggest that reality is
more complicated 30 52 Modeling of the electron density and spin-labeling studies
suggest that CheW and the P5 domain of CheA form alternating CheWCheA rings
connecting the trimers with P5 occupying positions approximately equivalent to CheW
see Fig 10 This arrangement is consistent with the strong structural homology
between P5 and CheW However to describe the FRET data obtained with cells with
overexpressed CheA and CheW 12 our model predicts that CheA2 has the role of a
bridging molecule and connects trimers via a CheW associated with each trimer
Indeed an alternative linker with direct receptor-CheA binding and hence symmetric
roles of CheA and CheW upon clustering does not match the FRET data see panel D
in S4 Fig This view is supported by binding assays which show that CheW binds
much firmer to receptor trimers than CheA to trimers see Fig 5AB in 9 and also
discussion in 29
Figure 10 Structural insights from electron cryotomography A Our linker
CheWCheA2CheW based on nanodisc experiments black line 9 appears to be
more complicated in reality where the P5 domain of CheA homologous to CheW may
also contact the trimers of dimers directly contact 1 in red 21 31 32 Such an
alternative linker defined as CheWCheA2CheW is explored in S4 Fig However
the binding of CheW to the trimers contact 2 in orange is presumably much stronger
see Fig 5AB in 9 and discussion in 29 rendering CheA2 effectively a bridging
molecule B Hexagonally packed trimer-of-dimers structure in which the inner
connecting ring is formed by alternating CheWCheA P5 units 2831 52
Although our model qualitatively reproduces the experimental FRET data the
change in cooperativity with variation in W is less pronounced in the simulation than
in experiments Recent findings based on electron cryotomography offer a possible
explanation for this shortcoming Briegel et al 30 and Liu et al 31 stress the
importance of the implemented core unit stoichiometry but they propose a second type
of linker that only involves CheW with P5CheW interactions replaced by
CheWCheW interactions 31 To investigate the consequences of these findings for
signaling behavior we allowed for an additional CheWCheW2CheW linker in our
model The simulated dose-response curves show a greatly enhanced change of
cooperativity with variation in W Fig 8C and Fig 11A The generally increased Hill
coefficients and hence sensitivity may reveal an evolutionary advantage that is not
ABTDlinker W-Acid31-WCheA2CheW12apparent in the tomography images but is detected by FRET However whereas
CheW-only linkers fit the FRET observations their incorporation into complexes needs
to be tightly regulated Moreover in addition to excluding CheA from signaling Fig
11B high levels of CheW were also claimed to disrupt receptor clustering 53 Taken
together these observations suggest that an optimal level of CheW is required for
cooperative signaling by receptors Fig 11C
In conclusion our work integrates functional FRET and structural nanodisc and
electron cryotomography data explains the paradoxes that increased levels of CheA
lead to less cooperativity and provides a functional role for CheW-only linkers Our
proposed linker CheWCheA2CheW is consistent both with the data from
experiments with nanodiscs 9 and with images from electron cryotomography 2931
if the P5 domain of CheA binds more weakly to the receptor than does CheW We
predict that the observed tetrameric CheW linker if incorporated at an optimal level
increases the cooperativity while keeping the receptor activity at a sufficiently high level
An increased understanding of the protein connectivity in receptor clusters may aid not
only in describing the fundamental biology of receptor signaling including the role of
cytoplasmic receptor clusters in Rhodobacter sphaeroides and Vibrio cholerae 52 but
may also contribute to the design of novel biosensors 54
Figure 11 Simulations suggest that an optimal level of CheW is required
for highly cooperative signaling A Modeled Hill coefficients for different
expression levels of CheW as multiples of its native level W 0 CheA is modeled at its
native level A0 for all charts B The relative number of CheA dimers per linker is
simulated for the different levels of CheW expression Results are compared to the
native level W 0 C Although increased levels of CheW lead to larger clusters
formation of CheW-only linkers also excludes CheA from signaling These findings
suggest that an optimal CheW level is required to balance signaling sensitivity and
magnitude Model parameters are as in Fig 8
Materials and Methods
Keeping  constant requires nonlinear optimization of  at every ligand concentration
For performance reasons we therefore chose to implement the model in C and used a
custom-written toolbox to connect to MATLAB 2014a for parameter optimization and
plotting The value for  is determined based on Brents method for root-finding 55
Fitting of model parameters employs Global Search from MATLAB Global
Optimization Toolbox Multiple start points are generated using scatter-search options
5000 trial points For the different start points square deviations from experimental
data are minimized using the function fmincon with interior point optimization Note

Though parameter confidence intervals can be calculated based on robust regression
and the resulting covariance matrix especially for highly nonlinear models as ours their
validity is questionable given the underlying linear theory 56 We therefore decided
against including confidence intervals except for the fitted Hill curves
We note that for all simulations with variations in expression of CheA and CheW
the Hill amplitudes match quantitatively much better their experimental counterparts
than do the Hill coefficients This observation is partly owed to the fitting routine
With logarithmically spaced concentrations a difference in amplitude between model
and experimental curve directly impacts the corresponding 2 goodness-of-fit value In
contrast a small variation in the Hill coefficient only influences the slope of the curve
within a relatively narrow range of ligand concentrations and hence is less reflected in
the optimization function value

Receptor density increases with ligand concentration for constant chemical
potential A Receptor density as a function of ligand concentration for   38
solid and   45 dashed For a constant chemical potential  the values of the
single dimer energies fon and foff Eq 1 decrease with increasing ligand concentration c
The decrease in the resulting complex energies Fon and Foff Eq 4 is stronger for larger
complexes Hence larger complexes are favored with increasing ligand concentration
Eq 7 resulting in an increased receptor density Eq 11 The interim decrease in  for
  38 is the result of an ensemble effect While the probabilities of all complex sizes
increase with c the increase for larger complexes starts at higher c values Starting off
at a smaller receptor density this effect is not visible for   45 Finally both densities
asymptotically approach the maximal value of 12 B Normalized kinase activity as a

  38 the increase in receptor density is not apparent in the dose-response curve as
the receptors turn off before the density increase comes into effect For   60
however the increase in receptor density yields a bump in the dose-response curve All
