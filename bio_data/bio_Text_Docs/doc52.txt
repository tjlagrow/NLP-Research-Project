Abstract 
the  photoswitchable  fluorescent  protein 
Natural  Killer  NK  cell  activation  is  dynamically  regulated  by  numerous  activating  and 
inhibitory surface receptors that accumulate at the immune synapse Quantitative analysis of 
receptor dynamics has been limited by methodologies which rely on indirect measurements 
such  as  fluorescence  recovery  after  photobleaching  Here  we  report  a  novel  approach  to 
study how proteins traffic to and from the immune synapse using NK cell receptors tagged 
irreversibly 
photoswitched  from  a  green  to  red  fluorescent  state  by  ultraviolet  light  Thus  following  a 
localized switching event the movement of the photoswitched molecules can be temporally 
and spatially resolved by monitoring fluorescence in two regions of interest By comparing 
images  with  mathematical  models  we  evaluated  the  diffusion  coefficient  of  the  receptor 
KIR2DL1  023    006  m2s-1  and  assessed  how  synapse  formation  affects  receptor 
dynamics  Our  data  conclude  that  the  inhibitory  NK  cell  receptor  KIR2DL1  is  continually 
trafficked into the synapse and remains surprisingly stable there Unexpectedly however in 
NK  cells  forming  synapses  with  multiple  target  cells  simultaneously  KIR2DL1  at  one 
synapse  can  relocate  to  another  synapse  Thus  our  results  reveal  a  previously  undetected 
inter-synaptic exchange of protein

Introduction 
NK cells are characterized by their ability to lyse a variety of diseased cells without the need 
for prior antigen recognition One way in which NK cells can discriminate healthy cells from 
abnormal cells is according to the missing-self hypothesis that NK cells can recognize and 
eliminate  target  cells  which  have  down-regulated  surface  expression  of  class  I  major 
histocompatibility  complex  MHC  proteins  a  feature  of  many  virally-infected  or 
transformed cells 1 2 Broadly NK cell activation is regulated by the balance of signals 
from a large repertoire of activating and inhibitory receptors expressed at their surface When 
an NK cell meets a potential target cell activating receptors can be ligated If the appropriate 
MHC class I protein is also present on the target cell inhibitory receptors will be engaged to 
transduce inhibitory signals that can interfere with activating signaling to protect the target 
cell from being lysed Inhibitory receptors expressed by human NK cells include three main 
families  killer  immunoglobulin-like  receptors  KIRs  the  CD94NKG2  receptors  and  the 
leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptors LIRs also known as ILT Receptors from the KIR 
family  recognize  classical  MHC  class  I  proteins  -  human  leukocyte  antigens  HLA-A  -B 
and -C 35  
Imaging  NK  cells  in  contact  with  susceptible  and  resistant  target  cells  has  shown  that 
inhibitory signals do not inhibit cell function globally but are spatially restricted towards a 
specific target cell 6 7 This is facilitated by the assembly of an immune synapse - a cell-
cell  interface  at  which  receptors  and  signaling  molecules  organize  The  formation  of  an 
activating  or  cytolytic  synapse  is  dependent  on  ATP  and  the  reorganization  of  the  actin 
cytoskeleton 8 9 However the accumulation of inhibitory receptors and ligands at the NK 
cell synapse has been shown to occur to a large extent independently from remodeling of the 
actin cytoskeleton or other ATP-driven processes 6 1012 Importantly however there has 
been a long-standing controversy as to whether or not the accumulation of KIR receptors at 
synapses is entirely independent of the cytoskeleton since the speed of KIR accumulation at 
the  synapse  is  influenced  by  pharmacological  inhibitors  of  actin  polymerization  11 
However  diffusion  of  KIR  proteins  in  the  NK  cell  membrane  and  the  dynamics  of  the 
recruitment of KIR to the immune synapse have been little studied quantitatively 
More broadly cellular signaling and cell-fate decisions are tightly regulated and dependent 
on protein dynamics which are difficult to observe in real time Typically imaging of protein 
behavior in cell membranes has relied on indirect measurements based on photobleaching of 
fluorophores  However  these  methods  do  not  allow  direct  visualization  of  proteins  within 
cells Here to demonstrate our quantitative analysis of photoswitchable fluorescent proteins 
for studying protein dynamics we consider the specific example of receptor recruitment to an 
immune synapse By photoconverting molecules from green to red fluorescence in selected 
regions  of  the  cell  membrane  this  technique  can  be  used  to  monitor  the  movements  of 
KIR2DL1 within NK cell membranes We found that in unconjugated NK cells the dynamics 
of  KIR2DL1  fit  a  free  diffusion  model  In  the  presence  of  a  target  cell  expressing  an 
appropriate  ligand  for  KIR2DL1  the  KIR2DL1  protein  was  continuously  recruited  to  the 
immune synapse where it remained stable unless a second synapse was formed in which 
case KIR2DL1 was able to traffic from one synapse to another We explored the mechanism 
of accumulation within the synapse using different mathematical models of KIR dynamics 
and found that receptor confinement in the synapse can be modeled by imposing either an 
apparent force or reduced diffusion in the synapse 
  
Materials and Methods 
Cell culture The NK cell line YTS and the target cell line 721221 an EBV-transformed B 
cell  line  selected  to  lack  endogenous  cell  surface  expression  of  HLA  proteins  hereafter 
referred to as 221 were maintained in RPMI-1640 GIBCO supplemented with 10 FCS 
2mM L-glutamine and 1mM penicillinstreptomycin all Invitrogen complete medium 221 
cells  transfected  to  express  HLA-Cw4  221Cw4  were  generated  as  previously  described 
13 YTS cells transfected to express tdEosFP-tagged KIR2DL1 YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP 
were generated by retroviral transduction of YTS cells as previously described 14 Briefly 
the packaging cell line Phoenix-amphotropic Nolan lab Stanford was transfected with the 
retroviral vector PINCO encoding the KIR2DL1-tdEosFP fusion protein using Lipofectamine 
LTX Invitrogen Viral supernatant collected 24 and 48 hours post-transfection was used in 
three sequential centrifugations 45 minutes 1600 rpm 30C for infection of 106 YTS cells 
Two weeks post-infection cells expressing KIR2DL1 were enriched by flow cytometry  
Plasmid generation We have described the generation of the KIR2DL1-tdEosFP construct 
elsewhere 14 In brief to generate the C-terminal tag of KIR2DL1001 with tdEosFP the 
coding  sequence  for  tdEosFP  Mobitec  Germany  was  inserted  to  replace  the  GFP  in  the 
retroviral vector PINCO expressing KIR2DL1-GFP 15 using the BamHINotI sites 
Live cell confocal fluorescence microscopy For live cell microscopy cells were imaged in 
eight-well  chambered  borosilicate  coverglasses  LabTek  Nunc  Rochester  NY  pre-coated 
with 10 g ml-1 fibronectin Sigma Cells were imaged by confocal microscopy using an SP5 
inverted  confocal  microscope  TCS  SP5  RS  Leica  Microsystems  using  a  63x  water 
immersion  objective  with  a  numerical  aperture  of  12  Simultaneous  imaging  in  different 
channels was performed by sequential line scanning Live cell images were acquired at 37C 
and 5 CO2 YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP and 221Cw4 cells were gently added to fibronectin-
coated chamber slides at a 11 ratio just before imaging During live cell acquisitions a small 
region of the YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP membrane was selected and the tdEosFP molecules in 
this region were photoconverted from green to red fluorescence FRAP Wizard Leica This 
photoswitching involved firing the 405 nm UV laser at 80 laser power at a specific region 
of the cell membrane for seven seconds The cells were then imaged for a further 20 minutes 
at one frame every ten seconds to follow the movement of the photoswitched molecules The 
green emission from tdEosFP was visualized using the 496 nm laser line fluorescence was 
collected between 500 and 550 nm and the red emission wavelengths were visualized using 
excitation with a 543 nm laser line and fluorescence collected at 575-650 nm 
Image  processing  Imaging  data  obtained  from  the  photoswitching  experiments  were 
processed and analyzed ImageJ US National Institutes of Health Bethesda MA To correct 
for  movement  of  cells  or  cell  conjugates  across  the  field  of  view  during  acquisition  the 
frames within each image sequence were aligned plug-in for ImageJ StackReg Philippe 
Thvenaz Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne Switzerland The images were 
then  assigned  a  threshold  to  minimize  background  fluorescence  before  further  analysis 
Measurements in the red channel were taken at the region where tdEosFP molecules were 
photoconverted to red during the acquisition as well as the membrane region directly opposite 
Fig S1 in the Supporting Material Fluorescence was monitored in narrow strip regions to 
take into account any remaining cell movement and changes in cell shape that might have 
occurred during the acquisition For each region the number of fluorescent pixels within that 
region  was  measured  This  method  was  validated  by  measuring  the  length  of  membrane 
  
differential operator which on a sphere of radius r is given by 
detected within the two monitoring regions in a typical image sequence Fig S1 The error 
of the mean was smaller than 06 indicating that for each region that is selected the length 
of  membrane  under  analysis  remains  constant  for  the  whole  image  sequence  Following 
validation  this  method  was  applied  to  all  cells  in  further  experiments  The  data  were 
normalized  to  the  first  time  point  after  photoswitching  This  normalization  allowed  the 
comparison of different cells that might have had different initial levels of red fluorescence 
after photoswitching 
Mathematical  modeling  Given  the  size  of  the  initial  photoswitched  area  an  accurate 
estimate  of  the  receptor  density  at  any  subsequent  time  can  be  determined  by  modeling 
receptor diffusion over a surface When no target cell is attached to the NK cell ie when no 
immune synapse is formed a reasonable assumption is that of free diffusion of the receptor 
on a membrane The distribution of the receptors is then obtained by exactly solving the free-
diffusion equation on a spherical cell  

where  is  the  receptor  density  on  a  point  on  the  sphere  of  radius  r  at  a  given 
azimuthal  angle   and  polar  angle    D  is  the  diffusion  coefficient  which  is  directly 
proportional  to  the  receptor  mobility  through  the  Einstein  relation  and   the  Laplacian

which depends only on D and the initial condition    are the Legendre polynomials 
The exact solution is obtained for  but convergence is obtained for 20 terms in the 
to the projection on the sphere of a rectangular strip of size s0 10 x 14  ie the area

The general solution of the free-diffusion equation is 
sum The initial condition is given by the experimental procedure and therefore corresponds 
activated  through  controlled  photoswitching  The  above  solution  integrated  over  the 
experimental detection area is proportional to the recorded red light intensity coming from 
that area As dictated by the experimental protocol this area is taken either within or opposite 
to the photoswitched area The diffusion coefficient and proportionality constant converting 
the integrated density of receptors into their red luminosity were fitted using minimization of 
2 quality-of-fit function 
In  the  presence  of  a  target  cell  imaging  data  show  an  accumulation  of  receptors  at  the 
synaptic attachment with the target cell ruling out that free diffusion is taking place inside 
the synapse We therefore resort to numerical modeling adding to free diffusion inside the 
synapse the binding and unbinding process of KIR2DL1 receptors to ligands on the target cell 
and either of the two following conditions i recruitment of KIR2DL1 receptors modeled 
with an attractive force which traps the receptors in the synapse or ii a slower diffusion 
coefficient  due  to  trafficking  occurring  only  inside  the  synapse  effectively  trapping  the 
receptors therein  
Both models include free diffusion outside the synapse ie Eq 1 Inside the synapse model 
i is mathematically described by the following equations 
  

  
 F                                                                          4 

                             4 
with F the force field in the synapse of strength KS  the density of ligand on the 
target  cell  and      the  total  density  of  receptors  in 
the synapse given by the sum of those bound to the target cell pb and those unbound pu Eqs 
4 are of reaction-diffusion type with a force field and can be interpreted as a Fokker-Planck 
equation 16 with the addition of the terms carrying the parameters kb  and ku which describe 
the binding and unbinding of receptors to ligand on the target cell inside the synapse Setting 
KS0  in  Eqs  4  amounts  to  having  only  uniform  diffusion  of  receptors  with  binding  and 
unbinding to ligand inside the synapse 
In contrast model ii describes the receptor dynamics inside the synapse as follows 
     5  
                                             5 


with DS  D setting slow diffusion inside the synapse Notice that according to both models 
only unbound receptors can diffuse inside the synapse while bound receptors are immobile 
no diffusive term in Eqs 4b and 5b For the binding and unbinding rates kb  and ku we adopt 
throughout the paper the values 2x105 M-1s-1 and 2 s-1 as derived from experiments 17 18 
We  numerically  integrated  the  above  equations  on  a  planar  grid  with  periodic  boundary 
conditions using once more a small area of size s0 either opposite to the synapse or within the 
synapse The models were subsequently fitted to the fluorescence data from the experiments 
The  fitting  parameters  were  the  diffusion  coefficient  and  the  force  parameter  for  the  force 
model  and  the  two  diffusion  coefficients  inside  and  outside  the  synapse  for  the  slow 
diffusion model An overall rescaling parameter was also used to account for the conversion 
of the integrated receptor density provided by the models into light intensity  This rescaling 
parameter  was  chosen  differently  for  the  conversion  at  the  synapse  and  the  conversion 
opposite  to  the  synapse  since  the  presence  of  the  target  cell  at  the  synapse  is  expected  to 
affect the transmitted fluorescence 
  
Results 
Mobility of KIR2DL1 in unconjugated NK cells 
To  investigate  the  membrane  dynamics  of  the  inhibitory  receptor  KIR2DL1  the  immortal 
NK cell line YTS was transfected to express KIR2DL1 fused to the photoswitchable protein 
tdEosFP A stable cell line expressing KIR2DL1-tdEosFP was established as demonstrated 
by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy and the functionality of the construct in these 
cells was tested in cytotoxicity assays 14 The photoswitchable fluorescent protein tdEosFP 
is  capable  of  an  irreversible  photoconversion  from  green  fluorescence  to  red  fluorescence 
upon near-UV irradiation at 390 nm 1921 With the development of such proteins it has 
become possible to selectively photoactivate fluorescent molecules in specific regions of the 
cell  membrane  by  locally  irradiating  these  regions  with  a  short  pulse  of  near-UV  light  as 
demonstrated here in Fig 1  
To  investigate  the  diffusion  of  KIR2DL1  in  the  membrane  of  unconjugated  NK  cells 
YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP cells were imaged by confocal microscopy in the absence of target 
cells  A  small  portion  of  the  membrane  was  selected  and  tdEosFP  molecules  were 
photoconverted  from  green  to  red  fluorescence  within  this  region  by  illumination  with  the 
UV laser Each cell was imaged for 20 minutes after photoswitching to follow the movement 
of the KIR2DL1-tdEosFP fusion protein in the membrane of the cell during which time the 
red fluorescence was seen to diffuse around the cell until it was uniformly distributed in the 
cell membrane Fig 2A For each cell the fluorescence both at the site of photoswitching 
and in the region opposite the site of photoswitching was quantified analyzed and modeled 
Fig 2B C  D An exponential decrease in the amount of red fluorescence at the site of 
photoswitching  was  observed  coupled  with  a  gradual  increase  of  red  fluorescence  in  the 
region opposite the site of photoswitching Fig 2D Importantly the red fluorescence within 
the  cell  membrane  appears  to  reach  equilibrium  in  the  two  sites  of  measurement  as 
demonstrated by the two curves meeting on the graph after approximately 1000 seconds 16-
17 minutes  
variances the diffusion coefficient of KIR2DL1 was found to be   023  006 m2s-1 Fig 
By  fitting  the  free  diffusion  model  in  Eq  3  to  the  mean  intensity  data  obtained  from 
experiments  on  n    10  cells  with  deviations  weighted  by  the  inverse  of  the  experimental 
2C    D  The  coefficient  of  determination R2  which  quantifies  the  goodness  of  fit  of  a 
predictive model had a value of 090 indicating that the experimental data and the model 
simulations  were  highly  correlated  It  is  important  to  note  that  due  to  cells  rarely  being 
perfect  spheres  and  ruffling  of  the  plasma  membrane  our  diffusion  constants  may 
underestimate the values of real diffusion coefficients Figure 2E shows the distribution of 
values for the diffusion coefficients obtained by fitting each cell individually see also Fig S2 
in the Supporting Material The average Dav of the values from individual fits coincides with 
the  value  obtained  by  fitting  the  mean  curve  Fig  2D  Our  value  of  the  diffusion 
coefficient  for  KIR2DL1  is  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  values  obtained  for  other 
immune membrane receptors using other techniques such as 012  001 m2s-1 for the T cell 
receptor 22 and 0067 m2s-1 for the inhibitory NK cell receptor CD94NKG2A complex 
23  
One caveat of using tdEosFP is that since it is comprised of a dimer it is a relatively large tag 
approximately twice the size of GFP that could potentially affect the mobility of KIR2DL1 
at  the  plasma  membrane  Therefore  to  validate  our  experimental  approach  we  performed 
  
fluorescence  recovery  after  photobleaching  FRAP  with  a  non-dimerizing  tag  We 
performed FRAP experiments on unconjugated YTS cells transfected to express KIR2DL1 
tagged to GFP Using this method we found that the fluorescence recovery curves obtained 
for KIR2DL1-GFP fit a free diffusion model and the average diffusion coefficient from n  
11  cells  Dav    022    009  m2s-1  coincided  with  the  coefficient  obtained  for  KIR2DL1-
tdEosFP Fig S3 in the Supporting Material In future studies an interesting option would 
be to use the newest version of EosFP mEos2 a monomeric variant that folds efficiently at 
37C 24 Together these data indicate that in unconjugated NK cells ie in the absence of 
ligation the KIR2DL1 receptor can diffuse freely within the plasma membrane of the cell at 
the micrometer-scale imaged by confocal microscopy  
Continuous recruitment of KIR2DL1 to the immune synapse 
To study how the dynamics of KIR2DL1 alters during the formation of an immune synapse 
YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP  cells  were  imaged  in  the  presence  of  221Cw4  target  cells  When 
incubated  together  the  cells  formed  inhibitory  immune  synapses  where  KIR2DL1 
accumulates  at  the  site  of  contact  between  an  effector  cell  and  a  target  cell  as  previously 
reported 6 To examine KIR diffusion tdEosFP molecules were photoswitched in the region 
directly opposite the synapse Fig 3A  B  
Two alternative mathematical models could be used to describe the recruitment of receptors 
to the synapse In the first model an elastic potential introduces a force pointing towards the 
center  of  the  synapse  and  proportional  to  the  distance  from  the  center  which  traps  the 
receptors within the synapse area Fig 3C top In the second model slow diffusion inside 
the synapse was assumed due to crowding Fig 3C bottom  
Interestingly  photoswitched  KIR2DL1-tdEosFP  molecules  continuously  trafficked  to  the 
immune synapse and accumulated there Fig 3A  D and the red fluorescence detected in 
the region opposite the synapse steadily decreased Fig 3D Both modeling approaches lead 
to an accumulation of the receptors inside the synapse in line with the experimental data Fig 
3D  receptor  density  profiles  shown  in  Fig  S4  in  the  Supporting  Material  These  results 
suggest that recruitment of KIR2DL1 to the immune synapse is a continuous and dynamic 
process 
Importantly simulations run with the two models Fig 3C show that a maximum coefficient 
of determination is achieved for a value of the diffusion coefficient outside the synapse close 
to  the  value  obtained  for  the  free  diffusion  case  ie  with  no  synapse  Fig  2E  the  slow 
diffusion model provides a value D  023 m2s-1 while the force model provides D  022 
m2s-1 Fig 3D These results show that when an immune synapse has formed KIR2DL1 
receptors  freely  diffuse  around  the  cell  membrane  before  reaching  the  synapse  This  is 
important because there has been considerable debate over whether or not KIRs are actively 
recruited to the synapse or not 6 11 Crucially these data argue against active recruitment 
eg an ATP-dependent cytoskeletal process for bringing KIR into the immune synapse  
KIR2DL1 molecules remain trapped within the immune synapse 
To  study  the  fate  of  KIR2DL1  molecules  once  at  the  immune  synapse  YTSKIR2DL1-
tdEosFP  cells  were  again  imaged  whilst  in  contact  with  221Cw4  cells  but  only  tdEosFP 
  
molecules  present  within  the  synapse  were  photoswitched  from  green  to  red  fluorescence 
Fig 4A  B  
The fit with the two proposed models Fig 4C is shown in Fig 4D note that each model 
was  fitted  simultaneously  to  the  fluorescence  data  of  Fig  3D  and  4D  Strikingly  the  red 
fluorescence remained stable within the synapse Fig 4A  D  A slight decrease in signal 
over the time of imaging could be accounted for in the control experiments testing for the 
decrease  in  intensity  due  to  photobleaching  Fig  S5  in  the  Supporting  Material  The 
fluorescence detected in the opposite area remained very low and stable throughout Fig 4A 
  D  These  results  show  that  once  the  receptors  have  entered  the  immune  synapse  they 
remain constrained or trapped within the immune synapse suggesting that relatively little 
KIR2DL1 is rapidly internalized degraded or diffuses away 
Figure  4D  suggests  that  our  two  models  with  receptor  confinement  in  the  synapse  are 
similarly  good  at  describing  the  data  -  the  overall  quality  of  fit  parameters  2  and  the 
coefficient of determination R show the force model to give a 10-15 better result residual 
errors plotted in Fig S6 in the Supporting Material The best fit was obtained when a force 
parameter corresponding to 20 pN was chosen see Discussion In contrast a model without 
receptor confinement in the synapse ie one solely relying on ligand-receptor binding was 
not able to explain the data Fig S7 in the Supporting Material  
Trafficking of KIR2DL1 between synapses 
NK  cells  can  form  synapses  with  multiple  target  cells  simultaneously  and  indeed 
YTSKIR2DL1-tdEosFP cells incubated with 221Cw4 cells were occasionally seen to form 
two  or  more  inhibitory  synapses  with  target  cells    This  begs  the  question  as  to  how 
KIR2DL1  molecules  would  behave  in  the  context  of  multiple  synapses  with  similar  target 
cells To address this when NK cells with multiple usually two synapses were found the 
tdEosFP  molecules  in  one  of  the  synapses  were  photoconverted  and  the  cells  were  then 
imaged  for  20  minutes  In  these  experiments  there  was  a  gradual  accumulation  of  red 
fluorescence detected within the second synapse Fig 5A B C  Fig S8 in the Supporting 
Material observed in seven different experiments Unexpectedly these results establish that 
there  is  a  transfer  of  proteins  between  synapses  formed  by  the  same  effector  cell  with 
different target cells 
This  finding  led  us  to  wonder  about  the  mechanism  behind  this  intersynaptic  exchange  of 
KIR2DL1  molecules  The  most  obvious  hypothesis  is  that  a  small  population  of 
photoswitched  molecules  was  able  to  leak  out  of  the  first  synapse  undetected  at  the 
resolution of confocal microscopy and was subsequently recruited to the second synapse by 
simple free diffusion These molecules would either be too few to be detected or more likely 
too few to be differentiated from the red fluorescence background see Fig S5 To test this 
we  performed  simulations  using  the  same  two  models  as  above  but  this  time  with  two 
synapses allowing for a small fraction of molecules to diffuse out of the first synapse Fig 
5D  In  both  models  these  assumptions  were  sufficient  to  reproduce  the  accumulation  of 
molecules  at  a  second  synapse  as  seen  in  the  experimental  data  and  within  the  same 
timeframes Fig 5E and Fig S9 in the Supporting Material Thus we conclude that although 
KIR2DL1 molecules are generally trapped within an immune synapse a small proportion of 
molecules is able to diffuse out and translocate into the other synapse 
  
Discussion 
To investigate receptor mobility in the membrane we applied a novel technique exploiting 
the  photoswitchable  properties  of  the  tdEosFP  protein  This  fluorescent  protein  can  be 
photoconverted from green to red fluorescence by UV light allowing direct visualization of a 
specific population of fluorophores after photoswitching We have shown that this technique 
can be successfully used to observe and quantitatively analyze the dynamics of membrane 
proteins in the setting of the NK cell immune synapse Our study revealed new aspects of the 
behavior  of  the  inhibitory  receptor  KIR2DL1  in  the  plasma  membrane  of  NK  cells 
Specifically  we  establish  that  KIR2DL1  molecules  freely  diffuse  around  the  plasma 
membrane of unconjugated NK cells In the presence of a target cell an immune synapse is 
formed between the NK cell and the target cell where KIR2DL1 molecules are continuously 
accumulated  and  to  a  large  extent  remain  trapped  Most  surprisingly  despite  the  fact  that 
receptors were found to be predominantly trapped within a single synapse we observed that 
when multiple immune synapses were formed KIR2DL1 molecules from one synapse were 
able to accumulate at a second synapse 
The  method  we  applied  here  may  prove  to  have  several  advantages  over  other  commonly 
used techniques since it allows the simultaneous observation of all the fluorescent molecules 
in the green and red fluorescence channels It is also relatively easy to implement The main 
technique  that  is  currently  used  to  study  protein  diffusion  is  fluorescence  recovery  after 
photobleaching FRAP 25 26 Even though FRAP enables the determination of membrane 
protein diffusion coefficients these are obtained by indirect measurements and this technique 
does not permit direct visualization of protein movement Other techniques have also been 
developed  to  study  protein  mobility  such  as  fluorescence  loss  in  photobleaching  FLIP 
which  is  used  to  monitor  the  continuity  of  cellular  compartments  through  continuous 
photobleaching  of  a  specific  small  region  2729  and  fluorescence  localization  after 
photobleaching FLAP where the protein of interest carries two fluorophores one of which 
is  photobleached  within  localized  regions  of  the  cell  30  However  all  these  methods  are 
based on photobleaching which requires long and intense illumination of a specific region 
and generally rely on indirect ways to track protein movements Instead photoswitching can 
provide a higher contrast between two subsets of molecules allowing molecules to be tracked 
rapidly  and  more  efficiently  than  photobleaching  31  By  photoswitching  fluorescent 
proteins molecules can easily be directly visualized moving around the cell This technique 
is  particularly  well  suited  to  the  study  of  the  immune  synapse  as  receptors  can  be 
photoswitched either within the synapse or elsewhere Molecules can be photoconverted in 
one region and monitored as they move to another In addition when using this technique 
two regions of interest are monitored following a single photoswitching event eg within the 
immune  synapse  and  opposite  the  synapse  which  allows  the  extraction  of  additional 
information  through  appropriate  modeling  Although  the  use  of  photoactivatable  and 
photoswitchable  fluorescent  proteins  to  study  protein  dynamics  has  been  proposed  and 
discussed 32 33 this type of technique has not been extensively applied 
Regardless of whether or not an NK cell was in contact with a target cell KIR2DL1 receptors 
freely  diffused  around  the  cell  membrane  In  contrast  the  population  of  accumulated 
KIR2DL1  receptors  at  the  immune  synapse  remained  relatively  stable  with  little  if  any 
diffusion of molecules out of the synapse indicating that KIR2DL1 molecules are effectively 
trapped within the immune synapse This suggests that immobilization of receptors at the 
site of contact as described here is a requirement for a sustained localized inhibitory signal 
10 
within cells that are continuously poised to kill the target cells that they encounter 23 The 
kinetic parameters of KIR2DL1-HLA-C binding are known to be extremely rapid with very 
fast  association  and  dissociation  rates  17  This  is  compatible  with  the  idea  that  receptors 
trapped within the synapse may serve to enhance signaling through serial ligand binding 
We  simulated  the  movement  of  receptors  using  two  models  the  first  with  receptors 
constrained within the synapse by a force and the second with receptor diffusion within the 
synapse  significantly  slower  than  outside  the  synapse  Comparison  with  experimental  data 
showed that both models of receptor confinement can reproduce the integrated fluorescence 
data  although  the  force  model  provided  a  slightly  better  fit  This  result  suggests  that  a 
physical force may restrain KIR2DL1 receptors within the synapse Our fitted force constant 
is  consistent  with  typical  forces  generated  by  polymerization  of  a  small  number  of  actin 
filaments  1-10  pN  34  The  direction  of  the  proposed  force  towards  the  center  of  the 
synapse may originate from retrograde actin flow which has been observed previously 35 
However even in the slow diffusion model the reduced mobility of receptors might be caused 
by binding of receptors to the underlying actin meshwork in the synapse This involvement of 
the actin cytoskeleton in regulating KIR2DL1 dynamics may be direct such as in the picket 
fence model 36 37 or indirect through the attachment of other molecules such as LFA-1 
to  the  cytoskeleton  effectively  causing  trapping  of  KIR2DL1  molecules  in  the  synapse 
Alternatively  slow  diffusion  in  the  synapse  may  arise  from  the  tethering  of  class  I  MHC 
proteins to the target cell actin cytoskeleton Binding between KIR2DL1 and class I MHC 
proteins  would  link  this  complex  to  the  target  cell  which  may  influence  the  dynamics  of 
KIR2DL1 There is evidence that the target cell cytoskeleton can influence the dynamics for 
NK cell synapses with dendritic cells 38 but perhaps not with other target cell types  
Consistent with actin-dependent receptor confinement in our two models previous work has 
shown that the actin cytoskeleton can control the efficiency and speed at which KIR2DL1 
receptors  enrich  at  the  immune  synapse  11  When  actin  polymerization  was  inhibited 
receptors have still been observed to accumulate at the immune synapse albeit after longer 
times  11  suggesting  that  an  intact  actin  cytoskeleton  may  be  required  for  the  rapid 
accumulation of KIR2DL1 receptors Our quantitative analysis adds a new line of evidence 
for the hypothesis that receptors are physically trapped within the immune synapse perhaps 
regulated by the actin cytoskeleton 
Both  models  are  in  line  with  the  observed  nanometer-scale  organization  of  KIR2DL1  into 
nanoclusters  within  the  synapse  14  KIR2DL1  receptor  nanoclusters  are  both  actin-
dependent and slow down receptor diffusion Indeed KIR2DL1 has been observed in small 
clusters containing 15-30 proteins both in the membrane of resting NK cells and of cells in 
contact with a target cell 14 In resting cells the formation of nanoclusters is consistent with 
the idea of membrane compartmentalization with short-term confinement of proteins within 
domains and long-term hop diffusion over the compartments 37 At the scale of microns  
imaging  whole  cells  such  as  in  our  experiments    this  hopping  effect  is  not  visible  but 
molecules  effectively  follow  an  apparent  free  diffusion  as  described  here  and  observed 
elsewhere  39  We  have  previously  shown  that  in  cells  forming  an  immune  synapse 
KIR2DL1 nanoclusters become smaller and denser and that these changes are dependent on 
an  intact  actin  cytoskeleton  14  which  is  consistent  with  actin  forces  controlling  the 
dynamics of KIR2DL1 behavior 
An observation that would not have been possible using photobleaching techniques to track 
receptors is that proteins from one synapse can traffic to a second immune synapse formed by 
the  same  NK  cell  with  a  second  target  cell  We  showed  that  the  movement  of  KIR2DL1-
11 
tdEosFP molecules from one synapse to another was rapid and in all cases occurred within a 
few minutes It is surprising that although KIR2DL1 receptors are physically trapped within 
an immune synapse they are able to traffic between synapses The most likely explanation 
for this observation is that a small population of switched molecules  below the detection 
limit of confocal microscopy  diffuses out of the first synapse diffuses in the cell membrane 
and gradually populates the second synapse This hypothesis is supported by our simulations 
with two synapses In the case of multiple synapses it is possible that KIR2DL1 receptors 
that are already involved in signaling at one synapse and are then recruited to another synapse 
can enhance and accelerate the response to another target cell  
12 
Conclusion 
In summary our use of mathematical models in combination with imaging a photoswitchable 
fluorescent  protein  has  revealed  new  aspects  of  KIR2DL1  recruitment  to  the  synapse 
including the surprising observation that proteins can traffic between synapses Our analyses 
best  fit  a  model  in  which  KIR2DL1  freely  diffuses  around  the  cell  membrane  and  then 
becomes trapped within the synapse which can be modeled as a synaptic force and reduced 
diffusion inside the synapse The apparent receptor confinement within the synapse is likely 
related  to  the  formation  of  a  dense  cytoskeletal  meshwork  at  the  immune  synapse  These 
results give rise to new questions regarding the mechanisms regulating KIR2DL1 dynamics 
and  recruitment  such  as  how  receptors  traffic  between  multiple  synapses  Moreover  this 
study  establishes  how  our  method  can  be  useful  in  studying  protein  dynamics  in  general 
across a range of specific situations
