Abstract 
Molecular interactions are key to many chemical and biological processes like protein function 
In many signaling processes they occur in sub-cellular areas displaying nanoscale organizations 
and involving molecular assemblies The nanometric dimensions and the dynamic nature of the 
interactions make their investigations complex in live cells While super-resolution fluorescence 
microscopies  offer  live-cell  molecular  imaging  with  sub-wavelength  resolutions  they  lack 
specificity for distinguishing interacting molecule populations Here we combine super-resolution 
microscopy and single-molecule Frster Resonance Energy Transfer FRET to identify dimers 
of receptors induced by ligand binding and provide super-resolved images of their membrane 
distribution  in  live  cells  By  developing  a  two-color  universal-Point-Accumulation-In-the-
Nanoscale-Topography uPAINT method dimers of epidermal growth factor receptors EGFR 
activated  by  EGF  are  studied  at  ultra-high  densities  revealing  preferential  cell-edge  sub-
localization  This  methodology  which  is  specifically  devoted  to  the  study  of  molecules  in 
interaction may find other applications in biological systems where understanding of molecular 
organization is crucial 
INTRODUCTION 
By providing optical images with spatial resolutions below the diffraction limit super-resolution 
fluorescence microscopies opened the possibility to study biological structures with finer details 
compared to conventional light microscopies12 Most existing methods rely on the optical control 
of  the  nano-emitters  fluorescent  state  population  For  instance  localization-based  methods 
consist in recovering the positions of numerous single molecules with high accuracy from image 
sequences where each frame contains only a few stochastically photoactivated emitters3-6 Several 
of these methods are suitable for imaging live bio-samples7-9 giving unique details about spatio-
temporal molecular organizations at the scale of a few tens of nanometers in cells1011 Functional 
signaling  molecules  are  frequently  highly  organized  in  molecular  assemblies  Molecular 
interactions  occur  at  the  nanometer  scale  and  are  generally  highly  dynamic  They  are  often 
triggered by an external activating signal like a specific ligand binding However although of 
prime importance to unravel several key molecular processes the identification in super-resolved 
imaging of molecular assemblies like multimers is still lacking Here we demonstrate that ligand 
activation can serve as the stochastic process necessary for identification and localization-based 
super-resolution microscopy of receptor dimers To this aim we continuously generated single-
molecule FRET signals originating from dimerized receptors by using distinct fluorescent ligands 
and recording their receptor binding in real-time This allowed obtaining for the first time specific 
images  of  ligand-activated  molecular  dimers  with  super-resolution  and  further  study  their 
dynamic  behavior  in  the  early  stage  of  their  activation  We  chose  epidermal  growth  factor 
receptors EGFR as model system We reveal specific membrane localization of EGFR dimers 
upon  binding  of  epidermal  growth  factor  EGF  In  addition  we  could  specifically  track  the 
movement  of  individual  receptor  dimers  with  unprecedented  statistics  on  a  single  cell  and 
compare their dynamic behavior to that of the full EGFR population 
EGFRs are cell-surface receptors belonging to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases and 
are  activated  following  binding  to  their  extracellular  domain  with  members  of  the  epidermal 
growth factor EGF family Because of the EGFR signaling significance in different carcinoma 
types  EGFR  has  been  the  focus  of  several  studies  using  fluorescent  microscopy  at  both 
ensemble12-15 and single-molecule levels16-19 Like many signaling receptors EGFRs are widely 
expressed at the membrane in monomeric and dimeric states Binding of EGF to receptors indeed 
induces  receptor  dimerization  and  tyrosine  autophosphorylation  that  activates  intracellular 
signaling  cascades  leading  to  phenotypic  changes  like  increased  proliferation  and  migration 
Importantly receptor endocytosis occurs in the minute time scale following EGF binding20 such 
that activated EGFRs dimers are only transiently present at the plasma membrane making their 
study challenging at high resolution in living cells  
RESULTS 
Live cell super-resolution imaging of functional membrane EGFRs  
The observation of ligand-activated membrane EGFR dimers by single molecule FRET requires 
first that specific imaging of functional EGFRs newly activated by EGF can be obtained with 
high  resolution  at  the  cell  membrane  To  this  aim  we  designed  a  two-color  super-resolution 
microscope based on the principle of uPAINT69 uPAINT relies on stochastically labeling in real-
time of target biomolecules by fluorescent probes and simultaneously recording their localization 
and dynamics on the cell membrane at the single molecule level using oblique illumination21 Fig 
1a The two-colors optical setup is built around a home-made dual-view system operating with 
single charge-coupled device camera22 Methods and Supplementary Fig1 In a first experiment 
live COS7 cells starved from growth factors overnight are illuminated with a 532nm laser beam 
Immediately  after  the  beginning  of  recording  fluorescent  EGF-Atto532  is  introduced  at  low 
concentration 04 nM in the imaging solution Fluorescence images 8000 consecutive CCD 
frames  are  recorded  in  the  green  detection  channel  with  an  integration  time  of  50  ms  The 
excitation beam angle is set to produce an inclined sheet of light above the glass slide23 with an 
illumination thickness of  2m at the center of the field of view In those conditions ligands 
newly  bound  to  their  target  membrane  receptor  are  efficiently  illuminated  while  unbound 
fluorescent  molecules  freely  diffusing  in  solution  are  mainly  not  illuminated  In  addition 
unbound  molecules  diffusing  close  to  the  cell  membrane  spend  statistically  at  most  two 
consecutive frames in the oblique illumination beam9 Such unwanted events are rejected from 
the  analysis  performed  with  homemade  software  Methods  Continuous  labeling  and  bound 
ligand photobleaching ensures sparse single molecule detection at the surface of the cells in each 
camera  frame  Single  molecule  localizations  are  obtained  with  sub-diffraction  precisions 
following image analysis Methods Fig 1b shows a reconstructed image of endogenous EGFRs 
activated by EGF-Atto532 binding The image is reconstructed from 16 105 EGFR localizations 
belonging to 104 single molecule trajectories Supplementary Fig2 Functionality of fluorescent 
ligand was controlled by observing that EGFR internalization occurs within minutes following 
binding of fluorescent EGF20 Supplementary Fig3  
Noteworthy the detection of each individual EGFR starts at the time an EGF binds the receptor 
Thus  an  EGFR  has  to  be  at  the  membrane  to  be  accessed  excluding  any  receptor  complex 
localized just beneath the membrane in an early endosome Receptor activation is captured with 
one imaging frame resolution 50ms and the detection of the activated receptors lasts until the 
fluorophore photobleaches typically in one second see Supplementary Fig 4 In our imaging 
conditions this bleaching time being shorter than the lifetime of the activated receptors at the 
membrane before endocytosis20 the super-resolution images exclusively display EGFRs that are 
present at the membrane Capturing receptors in their early states following ligand binding would 
not  be  possible  with  photo-activation  based  super-resolution  methods  since  fluorophore 
photoactivation and ligand binding processes are not time-correlated  
We  next  designed  a  live  cell  competition  assay  to  evaluate  the  specificity  of  EGF-Atto532 
labeling We used panitumumab a human monoclonal antibody highly specific to EGFRs which 
impedes EGF binding24 Supplementary Fig5 When a red fluorescent dye Atto-647N excited 
with  a  633  nm  He-Ne  laser  was  coupled  to  panitumumab  see  methods  fluorescent 
panitumumab  binding  to  EGFRs  are  detected  in  the  red  imaging  channel  producing  uPAINT 
super-resolved images Fig 1c akin to EGF labeling Fig 1b Membrane EGFR localizations 
differences  might  in  principle  be  found  between  antibody-labeled  EGFRs  and  EGF-labeled 
EGFRs  since  panitumumab  prevents  activation  of  the  receptors  while  EGF  activates  the 
receptors However revealing such differences would require a specific study which is out of the 
scope of this work In addition if a uPAINT acquisition is started with EGF-Atto532 as in Fig 1b 
and panitumumab is added in excess after a few seconds of recording supplementary Fig 6 
then  a  dramatic  drop  of  the  number  of  fluorescent  EGFR  detected  is  observed  Fig  1d  All 
together these experiments indicate that fluorescent EGF labeling is highly specific and allow 
imaging functional and newly activated EGFRs with high resolution 
Live cell super-resolution imaging of dimers ofligand-activated EGFRs 
The super-resolved image presented in Fig 1b displays the entire EGFR population localizations 
found at the membrane of live cells immediately after EGF activation without distinction about 
the monomeric or multimeric state of the receptors In particular although present EGFR dimers 
cannot be distinguished from isolated receptor in such images In order to obtain images of EGFR 
dimers  with  super-resolution  we  present  in  the  following  FRET  experiments  performed 
withEGF-Atto532 and EGF-Cy5 introduced in the imaging medium at equal concentration 02 
nM  We  chose  Atto532  and  Cy5  as  a  FRET  pair  for  their  relatively  large  Forster  radius25 
estimated to 65  In order to identify FRET events Fig 2a a single excitation laser 532nm 
was used and the images of the green and red camera channels were simultaneously recorded In 
these illumination conditions EGF-Atto532 is excited efficiently and detected solely in the green 
channel while EGF-Cy5 does not produce detectable signals when used alone Supplementary 
Fig 7 Gathering single molecule localizations recorded in the donor channel a super-resolved 
image of EGF activated EGFRs is obtained Fig2b from 42541 localizations corresponding to 
7078  single  molecule  trajectories  giving  similar  information  than  in  Fig  1b  where  EGFR 
monomers  and  multimers  could  be  distinguished  Importantly  fluorescent  spots  are  also 
recurrently  observed  on  the  cell  surface  in  the  acceptor  channel  They  originate  from  single 
molecule FRET occurring between EGFR dimers activated by an EGF-Atto532 and an EGF-Cy5 
Fig2a  This  is  further  evidenced  by  the  observation  of  anti-correlated  signal  detections  in 
corresponding positions of the donor and acceptor channels Fig2c and Supplementary Fig 8 
Collecting the single molecule localizations obtained by image analysis in the acceptor channel 
super-resolved  images  of  EGF  activated  dimer  EGFRs  are  reconstructed  as  shown  on  Fig2d 
from  18481  localizations  corresponding  to  3350  trajectories  and  on  Supplementary  Fig  9 
Interestingly the content of the acceptor channel is exclusively constituted by the subpopulation 
of EGFR dimers activated by two EGF molecules an EGF-Atto532 and an EGF-Cy5 In the 
donor channel this subpopulation was also present in the form of dimers labeled by two EGF-
Atto532 but was undistinguishable from other activated EGFRs populations including EGFR 
monomers It is thus possible to compare the images reconstructed from the two channels in 
order  to  extract  the  specific  localization  of  newly  activated  EGFR  dimers  from  the  entire 
population It is clearly seen that they are preferentially found at the cell edge Fig 2 b-c This 
specific localization of EGFR dimers also reported in other cell lines with low density single 
molecule imaging techniques18 reminds the notion that EGFR signaling can be regionalized and 
causes  the  recruitment  of  several  intracellular  signaling  proteins  involved  in  cell  motility 
especially at the leading edge of the cell26 This is in line with recent observations describing that 
EGFR is particularly activable in membrane regions with a high curvature27 This regionalization 
might also be related to preferential cell edge EGF activation of Ral proteins from the RAS-
family GTPase observed in COS 7 cells28 Indeed Ral binding proteins such as RalPB1 where 
proposed to regulate endocytosis of EGFRs via the partner protein of RalPB1 POB129 
Membrane diffusion properties of ligand activated EGFRs dimers 
We  next  used  single  molecule  tracking  to  study  the  diffusion  properties  of  EGFR  at  the  cell 
membrane Dimers mobility could thus be compared to that of the mixed population found in the 
donor channel with high statistics We analyzed the trajectories lasting more than 200ms detected 
in  the  acceptor  n  2025  and  donor  n4530  channels  Examples  of  such  trajectories  are 
displayed in Fig3a-b We computed the mean square displacement and measured the slopes at 
the origin to extract the instantaneous diffusion coefficient D of each tracked entity30 Methods 
Molecules  with  diffusion  constant  7x10-3m2s  were  considered  as  immobile  within  our 
resolution30 Fig3c presents the cumulative distribution of D values obtained on a single cell for 
EGFR dimers and for the entire population of activated EGFRs imaged in the donor channel 
Both distributions present an heterogeneity of diffusion coefficients ranging from highly mobile 
to immobile molecules suggesting that the heterogeneity observed in the donor channel green 
data point in Fig 3c is not primarily due to the multiplicity of EGFR multimeric compositions 
Finally the proportion of immobile dimers for the pure dimer population found by FRET red 
data points in Fig 3c is more pronounced than for the entire population of activated EGFRs 
imaged in the donor channel Activated EGFR monomers are thus likely to be more mobile than 
activated dimers The frequent immobilizations undergone by the dimer population might be in 
part the consequence of dimer trapping in preformed endocytotic coated pits31 
DISCUSSION 
In this work we have demonstrated super-resolution imaging and tracking of endogenous EGFR 
dimers using single molecule FRET in living cells Based on two-color uPAINT our method 
bears the key feature to rely on the stochastic real-time imaging of ligand binding and not on 
fluorophore photo-control of formerly labeled samples as in other super-resolution methods This 
ensures that newly activated receptors are continuously captured High-density single molecule 
FRET is thus obtained allowing transient molecular interactions to be extracted and specifically 
studied Our method may be applied to the study of other molecular assemblies than EGFR in 
live  or  fixed  samples  owing  to  the  advance  of  site  specific  labeling  of  proteins  with  small 
fluorescent molecules3233 For instance those developed with click chemistry tools34 hold great 
promise  toward  this  end  since  they  have  demonstrated  efficient  single  molecule  FRET 
capabilities35 This new approach giving access to the study of molecular interactions with both 
high resolution and high statistics should thus find applications in different systems of biology 
where understanding of complex nanoscale molecular organization is crucial 
METHODS 
Labeling of the EGF and antibody with fluorescent dyes  
Recombinant mouse EGF RD systems was conjugated with Atto532-NHS-ester Atto-Tec or 
Cy5-NHS-ester  Amersham  Bioscience  by  using  modified  versions  of  the  manufacturers 
procedures Briefly 100 g of EGF 1mgmL were incubated with 10 L of Atto532-NHS-ester 
or Cy5-NHS-ester  5mM in the presence of NaHCO3 01 M for 2 h at room temperature 
Separation of labeled ligands from unbounded dyes was performed in size-exclusion columns 
Sephadex G25 Pharmacia New Market NJ As mouse-EGFs have only one reactive amino 
residue the proteindye ratio was 11  Panitumumab antibodies were labeled with Atto647N-
NHS-ester Atto-Tec using the same protocol antibodiesdye ratio of about 11 
Sample preparation 
 COS 7 cells are cultured in DMEM Gibco with 10 FBS  The day before the experiment 
cells are detached with trypsinEDTA and platted on clean coverslips After few hours cells are 
washed and cultured in serum free condition Experiments are performed in Ringer in mM 150 
NaCl 5 KCl 2 CaCl2 2 MgCl2 10 HEPES 11 Glucose pH 74 with 1mgmL bovine serum 
albumin to reduce non-specific ligand adsorption Before acquisition the sample is incubated 
with a solution containing a low concentration of fluorescent beads to provide upon unspecific 
adsorption  on  the  coverslip  immobile  reference  objects  used  to  correct  long-term  mechanical 
instabilities of the microscope  Then the coverslip is mounted on an open chamber and 300 l of 
Ringer  solution  is  added  onto  the  cells  At  the  beginning  of  the  camera  recording  10  L  of 
fluorescent ligands are added final concentration is about 04nM 
Two-color uPAINT setup  
uPAINT acquisitions are performed on a custom-made dual-color microscope Figure S1 It is 
based  on  an  inverted  microscope  Olympus  equipped  with  a  100x  145NA  objective 
Fluorophores are excited in wide-field oblique illumination by tilting a collimated laser beam in 
the object focal plane of the imaging lens which focuses the beams in the back focal plane of the 
objective  The  resulting  angle  at  the  sample  is  set  to  5  This  allowed  to  image  individual 
fluorescent ligands which have bound to the cell surface while not illuminating the molecules in 
the above solution921 The angle was chosen to obtain an illumination thickness of  2m in the 
center of the field 
Atto532 dyes were excited by a 532 nm laser solid state laser Compass 415M Coherent Cy5 
dyes or Atto647N dyes were excited by a 633 nm HeNe Thorlabs A dichroic filter Semrock 
FF655-Di01 placed in the infinity detection path combined with a double bandpass emission 
filter Semrock FF01-577690 allows a spectral selection of the fluorescence signals in the donor 
Atto532 and acceptor Cy5 channels obtained simultaneously in two separated images on the 
EM-CCD camera QuantEM512SC Photometrics A slit 5 mm width is placed in the imaging 
plane  of  the  tube  lens  to  avoid  overlap  of  the  donor  and  acceptor  images  on  the  CCD  chip 
Images  are  acquired  at  20  framess  rates  Excitation  intensities  were  2kWcm2  and  ligand 
concentrations  were  adjusted  in  order  to  have  a  constant  pool  of    05  molm  fluorescent 
molecules We used fluorescent beads adsorbed on the glass coverslips as immobile fiduciary 
markers to correct for long-term mechanical instabilities of the microscope 
Control  uPAINT  experiments  with  EGF-Cy5  alone  showed  no  single  molecule  detections  in 
either  detection  channel  using  532  nm  laser  excitation  In  addition  when  EGF-Atto532  is 
introduced alone no single molecule detection can be detected in the red channel 
Single molecule segmentation and tracking  
A typical single cell acquired with the uPAINT microscope setup and protocol described above 
leads  to  a  set  of  8000  images  that  further  need  to  be  analysed  in  order  to  extract  molecule 
localization and dynamics Single molecule fluorescent spots were localized in each image frame 
and tracked over time using a combination of wavelet segmentation36 and simulated annealing 
algorithms3738 Under the experimental conditions described above the resolution of the whole 
 
system was quantified to  40 nm full width at half maximum Super-resolved images were 
computed by cumulating detections for all frames using the same intensity for each localization 
To analyze the trajectories we used the mean squared displacement  computed as  
where  and  are the coordinates of the label position at time  We defined the measured 
diffusion coefficient  as the slope of the affine regression line fitted to the   1 to 4 values of 
the    Short-trajectories  4  points  were  filtered  out  Immobile  trajectories  were 
   

defined as trajectories with D0007 m2s-1 corresponding to molecules which explored an area 
inferior to the one defined by the image spatial resolution 005m2 during the time used to fit 
the initial slope of the MSD
